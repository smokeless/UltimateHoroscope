Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your life in the first half of 2018 will be like a psychological boot camp that's designed to beef up your emotional intelligence. Here's another way to visualize your oncoming adventures: They will constitute a friendly nudge from the cosmos, pushing you to be energetic and ingenious in creating the kind of partnerships you want for the rest of your long life. As you go through your interesting tests and riddles, be on the lookout for glimpses of what your daily experience could be like in five years if you begin now to deepen your commitment to love and collaboration.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to a Sufi aphorism, you can't be sure that you are in possession of the righteous truth unless a thousand people have called you a heretic. If that's accurate, you still have a ways to go before you can be certified. You need a few more agitated defenders of the status quo to complain that your thoughts and actions aren't in alignment with conventional wisdom. Go round them up! Ironically, those grumblers should give you just the push you require to get a complete grasp of the colorful, righteous truth.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You may get richer quicker in 2018, Aries -- especially if you refuse to sell out. You may accumulate more clout -- especially if you treat everyone as your equal and always wield your power responsibly. I bet you will also experience deeper, richer emotions -- especially if you avoid people who have low levels of emotional intelligence. Finally, I predict you will get the best sex of your life in the next 12 months -- especially if you cultivate the kind of peace of mind in which you'll feel fine about yourself if you don't get any sex at all. P.S.: You'd be wise to start working on these projects immediately.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I hope that everything doesn't come too easily for you in the coming weeks. I'm worried you will meet with no obstructions and face no challenges. And that wouldn't be good. It might weaken your willpower and cause your puzzle-solving skills to atrophy. Let me add a small caveat, however. It's also true that right about now you deserve a whoosh of slack. I'd love for you to be able to relax and enjoy your well-deserved rewards. But on the other hand, I know you will soon receive an opportunity to boost yourself up to an even higher level of excellence and accomplishment. I want to be sure that when it comes, you are at peak strength and alertness.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In alignment with the current astrological omens, I have prepared your horoscope using five hand-plucked aphorisms by Aries poet Charles Bernstein. 1. "You never know what invention will look like or else it wouldn't be invention." 2. "So much depends on what you are expecting." 3. "What's missing from the bird's eye view is plain to see on the ground." 4. "The questioning of the beautiful is always at least as important as the establishment of the beautiful." 5. "Show me a man with two feet planted firmly on the ground and I'll show you a man who can't get his pants on."


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Many people go fishing all their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after," observed Henry David Thoreau. The spirit of Thoreau's observation is true about every one of us to some extent. From time to time, we all try to satisfy our desires in the wrong location, with the wrong tools, and with the wrong people. But I'm happy to announce that his epigram is less true for you now than it has ever been. In the coming months, you will have an unusually good chance to know exactly what you want, be in the right place at the right time to get it, and still want it after you get it. And it all starts now.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Adriana Martinez and Octavio Guillen got engaged to be married when they were both 15 years old. But they kept delaying a more complete unification for 67 years. At last, when they were 82, they celebrated their wedding and pledged their vows to each other. Are there comparable situations in your life, Aries? The coming months will be a favorable time to make deeper commitments. At least some of your reasons for harboring ambivalence will become irrelevant. You'll grow in your ability to thrive on the creative challenges that come from intriguing collaborations and highly focused togetherness.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

America's Civil War ended in 1865. A veteran from that conflict later produced a daughter, Irene Triplett, who is still alive today and collecting his pension. In the coming months, I foresee you being able to take advantage of a comparable phenomenon, although it may be more metaphorical. Blessings from bygone times, perhaps even from the distant past, will be available to you. But you'll have to be alert and know where to look. So now might be a good time to learn more about your ancestors, ruminate exuberantly about your own history, study the lives of your dead heroes, and maybe even tune in to your previous incarnations.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I share Vincent Van Gogh's belief that "the best way to know life is to love many things." But I also think that the next twelve months will be an inspiring time for you to be focused and single-minded in your involvement with love. That's why I encourage you to take an approach articulated by the Russian mystic Anne Sophie Swetchine: "To love deeply in one direction makes us more loving in all others." Halloween costume suggestion: a lover celebrating a sacred union to the love of your life, to God or Goddess, or to a symbol of your most sublime ideal.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

‚ùùI am my own muse," wrote painter Frida Kahlo. "I am the subject I know best. The subject I want to know better." Would you consider trying out this perspective for a while, Aries? If so, you might generate a few ticklish surprises. You may be led into mysterious areas of your psyche that had previously been off-limits. You could discover secrets you've been hiding from yourself. So what would it mean to be your own muse? What exactly would you do? Here are some examples. Flirt with yourself in the mirror. Ask yourself impertinent, insouciant questions. Have imaginary conversations with the person you were three years ago and the person you'll be in three years.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In his book The Logic of Failure, Dietrich Dorner discusses the visionaries who built the Aswan Dam in Egypt. Their efforts brought an abundance of cheap electricity to millions of people. But the planners didn't take into account some of the important effects of their innovation. For example, the Nile River below the dam no longer flooded its banks or fertilized the surrounding land every year. As a result, farmers had to resort to chemical fertilizers at great expense. Water pollution increased. Marine life suffered because of the river's diminished nutrients. I hope this thought will motivate you to carefully think through the possible consequences of decisions you're contemplating. I guarantee that you can avoid the logic of failure and instead implement the logic of success. But to do so, you'll have to temporarily resist the momentum that has been carrying you along. You'll have to override the impatient longing for resolution.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You wouldn't expect a five-year-old child to paint a facsimile of Picasso's Guernica or sing Puccini's opera, La Boheme. Similarly, you shouldn't fault your companions and you for not being perfect masters of the art of intimate relationships. In fact, most of us are amateurs. We may have taken countless classes in math, science, literature, and history, but have never had a single lesson from teachers whose area of expertise is the hard work required to create a healthy partnership. I mention this, Aries, because the next seven weeks will be an excellent time for you to remedy this deficiency. Homework assignments: What can you do to build your emotional intelligence? How can you learn more about the art of creating vigorous togetherness?


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Conceptual artist Jonathon Keats likes to play along with the music of nature. On one occasion he collaborated with Mandeville Creek in Montana. He listened and studied the melodies that emanated from its flowing current. Then he moved around some of the underwater rocks, subtly changing the creek's song. Your assignment, Aries, is to experiment with equally imaginative and exotic collaborations. The coming weeks will be a time when you can make beautiful music together with anyone or anything that tickles your imagination.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Psychologists say most people need a scapegoat -- a personification of wickedness and ignorance onto which they can project the unacknowledged darkness in their own hearts. That's the bad news. Here's the good news: The coming weeks will be an excellent time for you to neutralize that reflex and at least partially divest yourself of the need for scapegoats. How? The first thing to do is identify your own darkness with courageous clarity. Get to know it better. Converse with it. Negotiate with it. The more conscientiously you deal with that shadowy stuff within you, the less likely you'll be to demonize other people.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Two animals are pictured prominently on Australia's coat of arms: the kangaroo and the large flightless bird known as the emu. One of the reasons they were chosen is that both creatures rarely walk backward. They move forward or not at all. Australia's founders wanted this to symbolize the nation's pledge to never look back, to remain focused on advancing toward the future. The coming weeks will be a favorable time for you to make a similar commitment, Aries. Is there a new symbol you might adopt to inspire your intention?


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You're half-intoxicated by your puzzling adventures -- and half-bewildered, as well. Sometimes you're spinning out fancy moves, sweet tricks, and surprising gambits. On other occasions you're stumbling and bumbling and mumbling. Are you really going to keep up this rhythm? I hope so, because your persistence in navigating through the challenging fun could generate big rewards. Like what, for example? Like the redemptive transformation of a mess into an asset.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"We are continually faced by great opportunities brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems," said businessman Lee Iacocca. You are currently wrestling with an example of this phenomenon, Aries. The camouflage is well-rendered. To expose the opportunity hidden beneath the apparent dilemma, you may have to be more strategic and less straightforward than you usually are -- cagier and not as blunt. Can you manage that? I think so. Once you crack the riddle, taking advantage of the opportunity should be interesting.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Welcome to Swami Moonflower's Psychic Hygiene Hints. Ready for some mystical cleansing? Hint #1: To remove stains on your attitude, use a blend of Chardonnay wine, tears from a cathartic crying session, and dew collected before dawn. Hint #2: To eliminate glitches in your love life, polish your erogenous zones with pomegranate juice while you visualize the goddess kissing your cheek. #3: To get rid of splotches on your halo, place angel food cake on your head for two minutes, then bury the cake in holy ground while chanting, "It's not my fault! My evil twin's a jerk!" #4: To banish the imaginary monkey on your back, whip your shoulders with a long silk ribbon until the monkey runs away. #5: To purge negative money karma, burn a dollar bill in the flame of a green candle.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"To disobey in order to take action is the byword of all creative spirits," said philosopher Gaston Bachelard. This mischievous advice is perfect for your use right now, Aries. I believe you'll thrive through the practice of ingenious rebellion -- never in service to your pride, but always to feed your soul's lust for deeper, wilder life. Here's more from Bachelard: "Autonomy comes through many small disobediences, at once clever, well thought-out, and patiently pursued, so subtle at times as to avoid punishment entirely."


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I hope you're making wise use of the surging fertility that has been coursing through you. Maybe you've been reinventing a long-term relationship that needed creative tinkering. Perhaps you have been hammering together an innovative business deal or generating new material for your artistic practice. It's possible you have discovered how to express feelings and ideas that have been half-mute or inaccessible for a long time. If for some weird reason you are not yet having experiences like these, get to work! There's still time to tap into the fecundity.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In my astrological opinion, your life in the coming days should draw inspiration from the ancient Roman festival of Saturnalia, a six-day bout of revelry that encouraged everyone to indulge in pleasure, speak freely, and give gifts. Your imminent future could (and I believe should) also have resemblances to the yearly Doo Dah Parade in Pasadena, which features a farcical cavalcade of lunatics, like the Shopping Cart Drill Team, The Radioactive Chicken Heads, the Army of Toy Soldiers, and the Men of Leisure Synchronized Nap Team. In other words, Aries, it's an excellent time to set aside your dignity and put an emphasis on having uninhibited fun; to amuse yourself to the max as you experiment on the frontiers of self-expression; to be the person you would be if you had nothing to lose.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Are you feeling as daring about romance as I suspect? If so, I've composed a provocative note for you to give to anyone you have good reason to believe will be glad to receive it. Feel free to copy it word-for-word or edit it to suit your needs. Here it is: "I want to be your open-hearted explorer. Want to be mine? We can be in foolishly cool drooling devotion to each other's mighty love power. We can be in elegant solid-gold allegiance to each other's genius. Wouldn't it be fun to see how much liberation we can whip up together? We can play off our mutual respect as we banish the fearful shticks in our bags of tricks. We can inspire each other to reach unexpected heights of brazen intelligence."


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Greek word philokalia is translated as the "love of the beautiful, the exalted, the excellent." I propose that we make it your keyword for the next three weeks -- the theme you keep at the forefront of your awareness everywhere you go. But think a while before you say yes to my invitation. To commit yourself to being so relentlessly in quest of the sublime would be a demanding job. Are you truly prepared to adjust to the poignant sweetness that might stream into your life as a result?


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's not your birthday, but I feel like you need to get presents. The astrological omens agree with me. In fact, they suggest you should show people this horoscope to motivate them to do the right thing and shower you with practical blessings. And why exactly do you need these rewards? Here's one reason: Now is a pivotal moment in the development of your own ability to give the unique gifts you have to give. If you receive tangible demonstrations that your contributions are appreciated, you'll be better able to rise to the next level of your generosity.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Unless you were raised by a pack of feral raccoons or a fundamentalist cult, now is a perfect time to dive in to your second childhood. Is there a toy you wanted as a kid but never got? Buy it for yourself now! What were the delicious foods you craved back then? Eat them! Where were the special places you loved? Go there, or to spots that remind you of them. Who were the people you were excited to be with? Talk with them. Actions like these will get you geared up for a full-scale immersion in innocent eagerness. And that would be just the right medicine for your soul.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This is a perfect moment to create a new tradition, Aries. You intuitively know how to turn one of your recent breakthroughs into a good habit that will provide continuity and stability for a long time to come. You can make a permanent upgrade in your life by capitalizing on an accidental discovery you made during a spontaneous episode. It's time, in other words, to convert the temporary assistance you received into a long-term asset; to use a stroke of luck to foster a lasting pleasure.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

There are places in the oceans where the sea floor cracks open and spreads apart from volcanic activity. This allows geothermally heated water to vent out from deep inside the earth. Scientists explored such a place in the otherwise frigid waters around Antarctica. They were elated to find a "riot of life" living there, including previously unknown species of crabs, starfish, sea anemones, and barnacles. Judging from the astrological omens, Aries, I suspect that you will soon enjoy a metaphorically comparable eruption of warm vitality from the unfathomable depths. Will you welcome and make use of these raw blessings even if they are unfamiliar and odd?


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You have to admit that salt looks like sugar and sugar resembles salt. This isn't usually a major problem, though. Mistakenly sprinkling sugar on your food when you thought you were adding salt won't hurt you, nor will putting salt in your coffee when you assumed you were using sugar. But errors like these are inconvenient, and they can wreck a meal. You may want to apply this lesson as a metaphor in the coming days, Aries. Be alert for things that outwardly seem to be alike but actually have different tastes and effects.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you chose me as your relationship guide, I'd counsel you and your closest ally to be generous with each other; to look for the best in each other and praise each other's beauty and strength. If you asked me to help foster your collaborative zeal, I'd encourage you to build a shrine in honor of your bond -- an altar that would invoke the blessings of deities, nature spirits, and the ancestors. If you hired me to advise you on how to keep the fires burning and the juices flowing between you two, I'd urge you to never compare your relationship to any other, but rather celebrate the fact that it's unlike any other in the history of the planet.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Life is in the mood to communicate with you rather lyrically. Here are just a few of the signs and portents you may encounter, along with theories about their meaning. If you overhear a lullaby, it's time to seek the influence of a tender, nurturing source. If you see a type of fruit or flower you don't recognize, it means you have a buried potential you don't know much about, and you're ready to explore it further. If you spy a playing card in an unexpected place, trust serendipity to bring you what you need. If a loud noise arrives near a moment of decision: Traditionally it signifies caution, but these days it suggests you should be bold.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Sin" is a puerile concept in my eyes, so I don't normally use it to discuss grown-up concerns. But if you give me permission to invoke it in a jokey, ironic way, I'll recommend that you cultivate more surprising, interesting, and original sins. In other words, Aries, it's high time to get bored with your predictable ways of stirring up a ruckus. Ask God or Life to bring you some really evocative mischief that will show you what you've been missing and lead you to your next robust learning experience.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"A two-year-old kid is like using a blender, but you don't have a top for it," said comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Would you like to avoid a scenario like that, Aries? Would you prefer not to see what happens if your life has resemblances to turning on a topless blender that's full of ingredients? Yes? Then please find the top and put it on! And if you can't locate the proper top, use a dinner plate or newspaper or pizza box. OK? It's not too late. Even if the blender is already spewing almond milk and banana fragments and protein powder all over the ceiling. Better late than never!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The process by which Zoo Jeans are manufactured is unusual. First, workers wrap and secure sheets of denim around car tires or big rubber balls, and take their raw creations to the Kamine Zoo in Hitachi City, Japan. There the denim-swaddled objects are thrown into pits where tigers or lions live. As the beasts roughhouse with their toys, they rip holes in the cloth. Later, the material is retrieved and used to sew the jeans. Might this story prove inspirational for you in the coming weeks? I suspect it will. Here's one possibility: You could arrange for something wild to play a role in shaping an influence you will have an intimate connection with.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Beware of feeling sorry for sharks that yell for help. Beware of trusting coyotes that act like sheep and sheep that act like coyotes. Beware of nibbling food from jars whose contents are different from what their labels suggest. But wait! "Beware" is not my only message for you. I have these additional announcements: Welcome interlopers if they're humble and look you in the eyes. Learn all you can from predators and pretenders without imitating them. Take advantage of any change that's set in motion by agitators who shake up the status quo, even if you don't like them.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I have misgivings when I witness bears riding bicycles or tigers dancing on their hind legs or Aries people wielding diplomatic phrases and making careful compromises at committee meetings. While I am impressed by the disciplined expression of primal power, I worry for the soul of the creature that is behaving with such civilized restraint. So here's my advice for you in the coming weeks: Take advantage of opportunities to make deals and forge win-win situations. But also keep a part of your fiery heart untamed. Don't let people think they've got you all figured out.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

After George Washington was elected as the first President of the United States, he had to move from his home in Virginia to New York City, which at the time was the center of the American government. But there was a problem: He didn't have enough cash on hand to pay for his long-distance relocation, so he was forced to scrape up a loan. Fortunately, he was resourceful and persistent in doing so. The money arrived in time for him to attend his own inauguration. I urge you to be like Washington in the coming weeks, Aries. Do whatever's necessary to get the funds you need to finance your life's next chapter.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Before visiting Sicily for the first time, American poet Billy Collins learned to speak Italian. In his poem "By a Swimming Pool Outside Siracusa," he describes how the new language is changing his perspective. If he were thinking in English, he might say that the gin he's drinking while sitting alone in the evening light "has softened my mood." But the newly Italianized part of his mind would prefer to say that the gin "has allowed my thoughts to traverse my brain with greater gentleness" and "has extended permission to my mind to feel a friendship with the vast sky." Your assignment in the coming week, Aries, is to Italianize your view of the world. Infuse your thoughts with expansive lyricism and voluptuous relaxation. If you're Italian, celebrate and amplify your Italianness.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Be interested in first things, Aries. Cultivate your attraction to beginnings. Align yourself with uprisings and breakthroughs. Find out what's about to hatch, and lend your support. Give your generous attention to potent innocence and novel sources of light. Marvel at people who are rediscovering the sparks that animated them when they first came into their power. Fantasize about being a curious seeker who is devoted to reinventing yourself over and over again. Gravitate toward influences that draw their vitality directly from primal wellsprings. Be excited about first things.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The dragon that stole your treasure will return it. Tulips and snapdragons will blossom in a field you thought was a wasteland. Gargoyles from the abyss will crawl into view, but then meekly lick your hand and reveal secrets you can really use. The dour troll that guards the bridge to the Next Big Thing will let you pass even though you don't have the password. APRIL FOOL! Everything I just described is only metaphorically true, not literally.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Of course you want to get the best of everything. But that doesn't mean you should disdain cheap thrills that are more interesting and gratifying than the expensive kind. And of course you enjoy taking risks. But there's a big difference between gambling that's spurred by superstitious hunches and gambling rooted in smart research. And of course you're galvanized by competition. But why fritter away your competitive fire on efforts to impress people? A better use of that fire is to use it to hone your talents and integrity.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The more unselfish and compassionate you are in the coming weeks, the more likely it is you will get exactly what you need. Here are four ways that can be true: 1. If you're kind to people, they will want to be kind to you in return. 2. Taking good care of others will bolster their ability to take good care of you. 3. If you're less obsessed with I-me-mine, you will magically dissolve psychic blocks that have prevented certain folks from giving you all they are inclined to give you. 4. Attending to others' healing will teach you valuable lessons in how to heal yourself -- and how to get the healing you yearn for from others.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

As soon as you can, sneak away to a private place where you can be alone -- preferably to a comfy sanctuary where you can indulge in eccentric behavior without being seen or heard or judged. When you get there, launch into an extended session of moaning and complaining. I mean do it out loud. Wail and whine and whisper about everything that's making you sad and puzzled and crazy. For best results, leap into the air and wave your arms. Whirl around in erratic figure-eights while drooling and messing up your hair. Breathe extra deeply. And all the while, let your pungent emotions and poignant fantasies flow freely through your wild heart. Keep on going until you find the relief that lies on the other side.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I predict that you will have earned the title of Master Composter no later than March 26. Not necessarily because you will have packed your food scraps, wilted flowers, coffee grounds, and shredded newspapers in, say, a deluxe dual-chamber tumbling compost bin. But rather because you will have dealt efficiently with the rotting emotions, tattered habits, decrepit melodramas, and trivial nonsense that has accumulated; you will have worked hard to transform all that crap into metaphorical fertilizer for your future growth. Time to get started!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

My astrological radar suggests there's a space-time anomaly looming just ahead of you. Is it a fun and exotic limbo where the rules are flexible and everything's an experiment? That might be cool. Or is it more like an alien labyrinth where nothing is as it seems, you can hear howling in the distance, and you barely recognize yourself? That might be weird. What do you think? Is it worth the gamble? If so, full speed ahead. If not, I suggest a course correction.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

By my estimates, 72 percent of you Aries are in unusually good moods. The world seems friendlier, more cooperative. Fifty-six percent of you feel more in love with life than you have in a long time. You may even imagine that the birds and trees and stars are flirting with you. I'm also guessing that 14 percent of you are weaving in and out of being absurdly, deliriously happy, sometimes without any apparent explanation. As a result of your generosity of spirit, you may be the recipient of seemingly impossible rewards like free money or toasted ice cream or unconditional tenderness. And I bet that at least ten percent of you are experiencing all of the above.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your reputation is in a state of fermentation. Will this process ultimately produce the metaphorical equivalent of fine wine or else something more like pungent cheese? The answer to that question will depend on how much integrity you express as you wield your clout. Be as charismatic as you dare, yes, but always in service to the greater good rather than to self-aggrandizement. You can accomplish wonders if you are saucy and classy, but you'll spawn blunders if you're saucy and bossy.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Once upon a time, Calvin of the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip made this bold declaration: "Happiness isn't good enough for me! I demand euphoria!" Given your current astrological aspects, Aries, I think you have every right to invoke that battle cry yourself. From what I can tell, there's a party underway inside your head. And I'm pretty sure it's a healthy bash, not a decadent debacle. The bliss it stirs up will be authentic, not contrived. The release and relief it triggers won't be trivial and transitory, but will generate at least one long-lasting breakthrough.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Westward Ho! is the name of a village in southwestern England. Its name is impressive because of the exclamation point. But it's not as dramatic as that of the only town on earth with two exclamation points: Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, which is in Quebec. I invite you Aries folks to be equally daring. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you have a cosmic mandate and poetic license to cram extra !!!!s into all your writing and speaking, and even add them to the spelling of your name! Why? Because this should be one of the most exciting and ebullient phases of your astrological cycle -- a time to risk showing just how enthusiastic and energetic you are!!!!!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Are you more attracted to honing group dynamics or liberating group dynamics? Do you have more aptitude as a director who organizes people or as a sparkplug who inspires people? Would you rather be a Chief Executive officer or a Chief Imagination Officer? Questions like these will be fertile for you to meditate on in the coming weeks. The astrological omens suggest it's time to explore and activate more of your potential as a leader or catalyst.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a huge holy tree that links all of the nine worlds to each other. Perched on its uppermost branch is an eagle with a hawk sitting on its head. Far below, living near the roots, is a dragon. The hawk and eagle stay in touch with the dragon via Ratatoskr, a talkative squirrel that runs back and forth between the heights and the depths. Alas, Ratatoskr traffics solely in insults. That's the only kind of message the birds and the dragon ever have for each other. In accordance with the astrological omens, Aries, I suggest you act like a far more benevolent version of Ratatoskr in the coming weeks. Be a feisty communicator who roams far and wide to spread uplifting gossip and energizing news.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Light, electricity, and magnetism are different expressions of a single phenomenon. Scottish scientist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) was the first to formulate a theory to explain that startling fact. One of the cornerstones of his work was a set of 20 equations with 20 unknowns. But a younger scientist named Oliver Heaviside decided this was much too complicated. He recast Maxwell's cumbersome theory in the form of four equations with four unknowns. That became the new standard. In 2017, I believe you Aries will have a knack akin to Heaviside's. You'll see the concise essentials obscured by needless complexity.
You'll extract the shining truths trapped inside messy confusions.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Donatello was a renowned Italian sculptor. His favorite piece was "Lo Zuccone," a marble statue of the Biblical prophet Habakkuk. As Donatello carved his work-in-progress, he addressed it. "Speak, damn you! Talk to me," he was heard to say on more than a few occasions. Did the stone respond? Judging from the beauty of the final product, I'd have to say yes. One art critic testified that "Lo Zuccone" is a "sublimely harrowing" tour de force, a triumph of "forceful expression," and "one of the most important marble sculptures of the 15th century." I suspect you will have Donatello-like powers of conversation in 2017, Aries. If anyone can communicate creatively with stones -- and rivers and trees and animals and spirits and complicated humans, for that matter -- it'll be you.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Donatello was a renowned Italian sculptor. His favorite piece was "Lo Zuccone," a marble statue of the Biblical prophet Habakkuk. As Donatello carved his work-in-progress, he addressed it. "Speak, damn you! Talk to me," he was heard to say on more than a few occasions. Did the stone respond? Judging from the beauty of the final product, I'd have to say yes. One art critic testified that "Lo Zuccone" is a "sublimely harrowing" tour de force, a triumph of "forceful expression," and "one of the most important marble sculptures of the 15th century." I suspect you will have Donatello-like powers of conversation in 2017, Aries. If anyone can communicate creatively with stones -- and rivers and trees and animals and spirits and complicated humans, for that matter -- it'll be you.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

NPR's Scott Simon interviewed jazz pianist and songwriter Robert Glasper, who has created nine albums, won a Grammy, and collaborated with a range of great musicians. Simon asked him if he had any frustrations -- "grand ambitions" that people discouraged him from pursuing. Glasper said yes. He'd really like to compose and sing hip-hop rhymes. But his bandmates just won't go along with him when he tries that stuff. I hope that Glasper, who's an Aries, will read this horoscope and take heart from what I'm about to predict: In 2017, you may finally get a "Yes!" from people who have previously said "No!" to your grand ambitions.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Living is a form of not being sure, not knowing what next or how," said dancer Agnes De Mille. "We guess. We may be wrong, but we take leap after leap in the dark." As true as her words might be for most of us much of the time, I suspect they don't apply to you right now. This is one of those rare moments when feeling total certainty is justified. Your vision is extra clear and farseeing. Your good humor and expansive spirit will ensure that you stay humble. As you take leap after leap, you'll be surrounded by light.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Normally I cheer you on when you devote single-minded attention to pressing concerns, even if you become a bit obsessive. But right now, in accordance with astrological omens, I invite you to run wild and free as you sample lavish variety. It's prime time to survey a spectrum of spicy, shiny, and feisty possibilities . . . to entertain a host of ticklish riddles rather than to insist on prosaic answers. You have been authorized by the cosmos to fabricate your own temporary religion of playing around and messing around and fooling around.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow," wrote naturalist Henry David Thoreau in Walden, "to keep an appointment with a beech-tree, or a yellow birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines." I'd love to see you summon that level of commitment to your important rendezvous in the coming weeks, Aries. Please keep in mind, though, that your "most important rendezvous" are more likely to be with wild things, unruly wisdom, or primal breakthroughs than with pillars of stability, committee meetings, and business-as-usual.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Creative people are at greater risk," said psychiatrist R. D. Laing, "just as one who climbs a mountain is more at risk than one who walks along a village lane." I bring this to your attention, Aries, because in the coming weeks you will have the potential to be abundantly creative, as well as extra imaginative, ingenious, and innovative. But I should also let you know that if you want to fulfill this potential, you must be willing to work with the extra tests and challenges that life throws your way. For example, you could be asked to drop a pose, renounce lame excuses, or reclaim powers that you gave away once upon a time.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

There is a 97 percent chance that you will NOT engage in the following activities within the next 30 days: naked skydiving, tight-rope walking between two skyscrapers, getting drunk on a mountaintop, taking ayahuasca with Peruvian shamans in a remote rural hut, or dancing ecstatically in a muddy pit of snakes. However, I suspect that you will be involved in almost equally exotic exploits -- although less risky ones -- that will require you to summon more pluck and improvisational skill than you knew you had.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Now and then you display an excessive egotism that pushes people away. But during the next six weeks you will have an excellent chance to shed some of that tendency, even as you build more of the healthy pride that attracts help and support. So be alert for a steady flow of intuitions that will instruct you on how to elude overconfidence and instead cultivate more of the warm, radiant charisma that is your birthright. You came here to planet Earth not just to show off your bright beauty, but also to wield it as a source of inspiration and motivation for those whose lives you touch.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I am in awe of your headfirst, charge-forward, no-distractions approach. In fact, I aspire to incorporate more of the Aries-style directness into my own repertoire. But I also love it when, on rare occasions, you flirt with a more strategic perspective. It amuses me to see you experimenting with the power of secrets. Your wisdom often grows at an expedited rate when you get caught up in a web of intrigue that exposes you to dark joys and melodramatic lessons. During times like these, you feel fine about not having everything figured out, about not knowing the most straightforward route to your destination. You allow the riddles and enigmas to ferment as you bask in the voluptuous ambiance of the Great Mystery. Now is such a time.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I invite you to fantasize about what your four great-grandmothers and four great-grandfathers may have been doing on November 1, 1930. What? You have no idea how to begin? You don't even know their names? If that's the case, I hope you'll remedy your ignorance. Your ability to create the future you want requires you to learn more about where and whom you came from. Halloween costume suggestion: your most interesting ancestor.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the 1980s, two performance artists did a project entitled A Year Tied Together at the Waist. For 12 months, Linda Montano and Tehching Hsieh were never farther than eight feet away from each other, bound by a rope. Hsieh said he tried this experiment because he felt very comfortable doing solo work, but wanted to upgrade his abilities as a collaborator. Montano testified that the piece "dislodged a deep hiddenness" in her. It sharpened her intuition and gave her a "heightened passion for living and relating." If you were ever going to engage in a comparable effort to deepen your intimacy skills, Aries, the coming weeks would be a favorable time to attempt it.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A study published in the peer-reviewed Communications Research suggests that only 28 percent of us realize when someone is flirting with us. I hope that figure won¬ít apply to you Aries in the coming weeks. According to my analysis of the astrological situation, you will be on the receiving end of more invitations, inquiries, and allurements than usual. The percentage of these that might be worth responding to will also be higher than normal. Not all of them will be obvious, however. So be extra vigilant.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

At a recent party, a guy I hardly know questioned my authenticity. "You seem to have had an easy life," he jabbed. "I bet you haven't suffered enough to be a truly passionate person." I didn't choose to engage him, but mused to myself, "Not enough suffering? What about the time I got shot? My divorce? My five-year-long illness? The manager of my rock band getting killed in a helicopter crash?" But after that initial reaction, my thoughts turned to the adventures that have stoked my passion without causing pain, like the birth of my daughter, getting remarried to the woman I divorced, and performing my music for excited audiences. I bring this up, Aries, because I suspect that you, too, will soon have experiences that refine and deepen your passion through pleasure rather than hardship.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What's the difference between a love warrior and a love worrier? Love warriors work diligently to keep enhancing their empathy, compassion, and emotional intelligence. Love worriers fret so much about not getting the love they want that they neglect to develop their intimacy skills. Love warriors are always vigilant for how their own ignorance may be sabotaging togetherness, while love worriers dwell on how their partner's ignorance is sabotaging togetherness. Love warriors stay focused on their relationship's highest goals, while love worriers are preoccupied with every little relationship glitch. I bring this to your attention, Aries, because the next seven weeks will be an excellent time to become less of a love worrier and more of a love warrior.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Even if you are a wild-eyed adventure-seeker with extremist views and melodramatic yearnings, you'll benefit from taking a moderate approach to life in the coming weeks. In fact, you're most likely to attract the help and inspiration you need if you adopt the strategy used by Goldilocks in the fairy tale "Goldilocks and the Three Bears": neither excessive nor underdone, neither extravagant nor restrained, neither bawdy, loud, and in-your-face nor demure, quiet, and passive -- but rather just right.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What should you do if your allies get bogged down by excess caution or lazy procrastination? Here's what I advise: Don't confront them or berate them. Instead, cheerfully do what must be done without their help. And what action should you take if mediocrity begins to creep into collaborative projects? Try this: Figure out how to restore excellence, and cheerfully make it happen. And how should you proceed if the world around you seems to have fallen prey to fear-induced apathy or courage-shrinking numbness? My suggestion: Cheerfully kick the world's butt -- with gentle but firm good humor.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Two seven-year-old girls showed me three tricks I could use to avoid taking myself too seriously and getting too attached to my dignity. I'm offering these tricks to you just in time for the letting-go phase of your astrological cycle. Trick #1: Speak in a made-up language for at least ten minutes. Example: "Groftyp hulbnu wivgeeri proot xud amasterulius. Quoshibojor frovid zemplissit." Trick #2: Put a different kind of shoe and sock on each foot and pretend you're two people stuck in a single body. Give each side of you a unique nickname. Trick #3: Place an unopened bag of barbecue-flavored potato chips on a table, then bash your fist down on it, detonating a loud popping sound and unleashing a spray of crumbs out the ends of the bag. Don't clean up the mess for at least an hour.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Truth decay is in its early stages. If you take action soon, you can prevent a full-scale decomposition. But be forewarned: Things could get messy, especially if you intervene with the relentless candor and clarity that will be required for medicinal purification. So what do you think? Are you up for the struggle? I understand if you're not. I'll forgive you if you simply flee. But if you decide to work your cagey magic, here are some tips. 1. Compile your evidence with rigor. 2. As much as is humanly possible, put aside rancor. Root your efforts in compassionate objectivity. 3. Even as you dig around in the unsightly facts, cherish the beautiful truths you'd like to replace them with.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the coming weeks, I hope you won't scream curses at the rain, demanding that it stop falling on you. Similarly, I suggest you refrain from punching walls that seem to be hemming you in, and I beg you not to spit into the wind when it's blowing in your face. Here's an oracle about how to avoid counterproductive behavior like that: The near future will bring you useful challenges and uncanny blessings if you're willing to consider the possibility that everything coming your way will in some sense be an opportunity.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Can you imagine feeling at home in the world no matter where you are? If you eventually master this art, outer circumstances won't distort your relationship with yourself. No matter how crazy or chaotic the people around you might be, you will remain rooted in your unshakable sense of purpose; you will respond to any given situation in ways that make you both calm and alert, amused and curious, compassionate for the suffering of others and determined to do what's best for you. If you think these are goals worth seeking, you can make dramatic progress toward them in the coming weeks.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Using scissors, snip off a strand of your hair. As you do, sing a beloved song with uplifting lyrics. Seal the hair in an envelope on which you have written the following: "I am attracting divine prods and unpredictable nudges that will enlighten me about a personal puzzle that I am ready to solve." On each of the next five nights, kiss this package five times and place it beneath your pillow as you sing a beloved song with uplifting lyrics. Then observe your dreams closely. Keep a pen and notebook or audio recorder near your bed to capture any clues that might arrive. On the morning after the fifth night, go to your kitchen sink and burn the envelope and hair in the flame of a white candle. Chant the words of power: "Catalytic revelations and insights are arriving." The magic you need will appear within 15 days.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I apologize in advance for the seemingly excessive abundance of good news I'm about to report. If you find it hard to believe, I won't hold your skepticism against you. But I do want you to know that every prediction is warranted  by the astrological omens. Ready for the onslaught? 1. In the coming weeks, you could fall forever out of love with a wasteful obsession. 2. You might also start falling in love with a healthy obsession. 3. You can half-accidentally snag a blessing you have been half-afraid to want. 4. You could recall a catalytic truth whose absence has been causing you a problem ever since you forgot it. 5. You could reclaim the mojo that you squandered when you pushed yourself too hard a few months ago.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Free your body. Don't ruminate and agonize about it. FREE YOUR BODY! Be brave and forceful. Do it simply and easily. Free your gorgeously imperfect, wildly intelligent body. Allow it to be itself in all of its glory. Tell it you're ready to learn more of its secrets and adore its mysteries. Be in awe of its unfathomable power to endlessly carry out the millions of chemical reactions that keep you alive and thriving. How can you not be overwhelmed with gratitude for your hungry, curious, unpredictable body? Be grateful for its magic. Love the blessings it bestows on you. Celebrate its fierce animal elegance.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You now have more luxuriant access to divine luck than you've had in a long time. For the foreseeable future, you could be able to induce semi-miraculous twists of fate that might normally be beyond your capacities. But here's a caveat: The good fortune swirling in your vicinity may be odd or irregular or hard-to-understand. To harvest it, you will have to expand your ideas about what constitutes good fortune. It may bestow powers you didn't even realize it was possible to have. For example, what if you temporarily have an acute talent for gravitating toward situations where smart love is in full play?


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Upcoming adventures might make you more manly if you are a woman. If you are a man, the coming escapades could make you more womanly. How about if you're trans? Odds are that you'll become even more gender fluid. I am exaggerating a bit, of course. The transformations I'm referring to may not be visible to casual observers. They will mostly unfold in the depths of your psyche. But they won't be merely symbolic, either. There'll be mutations in your biochemistry that will expand your sense of your own gender. If you respond enthusiastically to these shifts, you will begin a process that could turn you into an even more complete and attractive human being than you already are.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Events in the coming week may trick your mind and tweak your heart. They might mess with your messiah complex and wreak havoc on your habits. But I bet they will also energize your muses and add melodic magic to your mysteries. They will slow you down in such a way as to speed up your evolution, and spin you in circles with such lyrical grace that you may become delightfully clear-headed. Will you howl and moan? Probably, but more likely out of poignant joy, not from angst and anguish. Might you be knocked off course? Perhaps, but by a good influence, not a bad one.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

During winter, some bears spend months hibernating. Their body temperatures and heart rates drop. They breathe drowsily. Their movements are minimal. Many hummingbirds engage in a similar slow-down -- but they do it every single night. By day they are among the most manic creatures on earth, flapping their wings and gathering sustenance with heroic zeal. When the sun slips below the horizon, they rest with equal intensity. In my estimation, Aries, you don't need a full-on immersion in idleness like the bears. But you'd benefit from a shorter stint, akin to the hummingbird's period of dormancy.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"The past lives on in art and memory," writes author Margaret Drabble, "but it is not static: it shifts and changes as the present throws its shadow backwards." That's a fertile thought for you to meditate on during the coming weeks, Aries. Why? Because your history will be in a state of dramatic fermentation. The old days and the old ways will be mutating every which way. I hope you will be motivated, as a result, to rework the story of your life with flair and verve.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The coming months will be a favorable time to boost your skills as a cagey warrior. I don't mean you should push people around and get into lots of fights. Rather, the goal is for you to harness your aggressiveness constructively and to wield your willpower with maximum grace. In the face of fear, you will not just be brave, but brave and crafty. You'll refrain from forcing storylines to unfold before they're ready, and you'll rely on strategy and good timing instead of brute strength and the decree "Because I said so." Now study this counsel from the ancient Chinese statesman Zhuge Liang, also known as Crouching Dragon: "The wise win before they fight, while the ignorant fight to win."


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Mythologist Joseph Campbell analyzed fairy tales for clues about how the human psyche works. For example, he said that a fairy tale character who's riding a horse is a representation of our relationship with our instinctual nature. If that character drops the reins and lets the horse gallop without guidance, he or she is symbolically surrendering control to the instincts. I bring this to your attention because I suspect you may soon be tempted to do just that that -- which wouldn't be wise. In my opinion, you'll be best served by going against the flow of what seems natural. Sublimation and transcendence will keep you much stronger than if you followed the line of least resistance. Homework: Visualize yourself, as you ride your horse, keeping a relaxed but firm grasp of the reins.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The voices in our heads are our constant companions. They fill our inner sanctuary with streams of manic commentary. Often we're not fully cognizant of the bedlam, since the outer world dominates our focus. But as soon as we close our eyes and turn our attention inward, we're immersed in the jabbering babble. That's the bad news, Aries. Now here's the good news. In the coming weeks you will have far more power than usual to ignore, dodge, or even tamp down the jabbering babble. As a result, you may get a chance to spend unprecedented amounts of quality time with the still, small voice at your core -- the wise guide that is often drowned out by all the noise.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To convey the best strategy for you to employ in the coming weeks, I have drawn inspiration from a set of instructions composed by aphorist Alex Stein: Scribble, scribble, erase. Scribble, erase, scribble. Scribble, scribble, scribble, scribble. Erase, erase, erase. Scribble, erase. Keep what's left. In other words, Aries, you have a mandate to be innocently empirical, robustly experimental, and cheerfully improvisational -- with the understanding that you must also balance your fun with ruthless editing.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"An oar moves a boat by entering what lies outside it," writes poet Jane Hirshfield. You can't use the paddle inside the boat! It's of no value to you unless you thrust it into the drink and move it around vigorously. And that's an excellent metaphor for you to keep in mind during the coming weeks, my friend. If you want to reach your next destination, you must have intimate and continual interaction with the mysterious depths that lie outside your known world.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Russian writer Anton Chekhov was renowned for the crisp, succinct style of his short stories and plays. As he evolved, his pithiness grew. "I now have a mania for shortness," he wrote. "Whatever I read -- my own work, or other people's -- it all seems to me not short enough." I propose that we make Chekhov your patron saint for a while. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you are in a phase when your personal power feeds on terse efficiency. You thrive on being vigorously concise and deftly focused and cheerfully devoted to the crux of every matter.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Silence is not silence, but a limit of hearing," writes Jane Hirshfield in her poem "Everything Has Two Endings." This observation is apropos for you right now. There are potentially important messages you're not registering and catalytic influences you can't detect. But their apparent absence is due to a blank spot in your awareness, or maybe a willful ignorance left over from the old days. Now here's the good news: You are primed to expand your listening field. You have an enhanced ability to open certain doors of perception that have been closed. If you capitalize on this opportunity, silence will give way to revelation.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The oracle I'm about to present may be controversial. It contains advice that most astrologers would never dare to offer an Aries. But I believe you are more receptive than usual to this challenge, and I am also convinced that you especially need it right now. Are you ready to be pushed further than I have ever pushed you? Study this quote from novelist Mark Z. Danielewski: "Passion has little to do with euphoria and everything to do with patience. It is not about feeling good. It is about endurance. Like patience, passion comes from the same Latin root: pati." 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"The writer should never be ashamed of staring," said Aries writer Flannery O'Connor. "There is nothing that does not require his attention." This is also true for all of you Aries folks, not just the writers among you. And the coming weeks will be an especially important time for you to cultivate a piercing gaze that sees deeply and shrewdly. You will thrive to the degree that you notice details you might normally miss or regard as unimportant. What you believe and what you think won't be as important as what you perceive. Trust your eyes.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"When I discover who I am, I'll be free," said novelist Ralph Ellison. Would you consider making that a paramount theme in the coming weeks? Will you keep it in the forefront of your mind, and be vigilant for juicy clues that might show up in the experiences headed your way? In suggesting that you do, I'm not guaranteeing that you will gather numerous extravagant insights about your true identity and thereby achieve a blissful eruption of total liberation. But I suspect that at the very least you will understand previously hidden mysteries about your primal nature. And as they come into focus, you will indeed be led in the direction of cathartic emancipation.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

French artist Henri Matisse (1869-1954) is regarded as one of the greats, in the same league as Picasso and Kandinsky. Even in his eighties, he was still creating marvels that one critic said seemed "to come from the springtime of the world." As unique as his work was, he was happy to acknowledge the fact that he thrived on the influence of other artists. And yet he also treasured the primal power of his innocence. He trusted his childlike wonder. "You study, you learn, but you guard the original naivet√©," he said. "It has to be within you, as desire for drink is within the drunkard or love is within the lover." These are good, sweet thoughts for you to keep in mind right now, Aries.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to my astrological analysis, you would benefit profoundly from taking a ride in a jet fighter plane 70,000 feet above the earth. In fact, I think you really need to experience weightlessness as you soar faster than the speed of sound. Luckily, there's an organization, MiGFlug (migflug.com), that can provide you with this healing thrill. (I just hope you can afford the $18,000 price tag.) APRIL FOOL! I do in fact think you should treat yourself to unprecedented thrills and transcendent adventures. But I bet you can accomplish that without being quite so extravagant.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When Orville and Wilbur Wright were kids, their father gave them a toy helicopter powered by a rubber band. The year was 1878. Twenty-five years later, the brothers became the first humans to sail above the earth in a flying machine. They testified that the toy helicopter had been a key inspiration as they worked to develop their pioneering invention. In the spirit of the Wright Brothers' magic seed, Aries, I invite you to revive your connection to a seminal influence from your past. The coming weeks will be a favorable time to feed a dream that was foreshadowed in you a long time ago.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Artist Steven Spazuk works exclusively with an unusual medium: soot from candles and torches. He spreads the stuff across a blank canvas, then uses various instruments to sculpt the accidental blobs into definitive forms. I've seen the results, and they're both well-done and intriguing. What would be the metaphorical equivalent, in your world, of using soot to make beautiful and interesting things? I think you're primed to turn waste into building blocks, rot into splendor, and lead into gold. (See Spazuk's work.)


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"He in his madness prays for storms, and dreams that storms will bring him peace," wrote Leo Tolstoy in his novella The Death of Ivan Ilych. The weird thing is, Aries, that this seemingly crazy strategy might actually work for you in the coming days. The storms you pray for, the tempests you activate through the power of your longing, could work marvels. They might clear away the emotional congestion, zap the angst, and usher you into a period of dynamic peace. So I say: Dare to be gusty and blustery and turbulent.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Actress Blythe Baird writes about the problem that arises when her dog sees her eating a peanut butter and chocolate chip bagel. Her beloved pet begs for a piece and becomes miserable when it's not forthcoming. Baird is merely demonstrating her love, of course, because she knows that eating chocolate can make canines ill. I suspect that life is bestowing a comparable blessing on you. You may feel mad and sad about being deprived of something you want. But the likely truth is that you will be lucky not to get it.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Just one species has a big enough throat to swallow a person whole: the sperm whale. If you happen to be sailing the high seas any time soon, I hope you will studiously avoid getting thrown overboard in the vicinity of one of these beasts. The odds are higher than usual that you'd end up in its belly, much like the Biblical character Jonah. (Although, like him, I bet you'd ultimately escape.) Furthermore, Aries, I hope you will be cautious not to get swallowed up by anything else. It's true that the coming weeks will be a good time to go on a retreat, to flee from the grind and take a break from the usual frenzy. But the best way to do that is to consciously choose the right circumstances rather than leave it to chance.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Old paint on a canvas, as it ages, sometimes becomes transparent," said playwright Lillian Hellman. "When that happens, it is possible to see the original lines: a tree will show through a woman's dress, a child makes way for a dog, a large boat is no longer on an open sea." Why does this happen? Because the painter changed his or her mind. Early images were replaced, painted over. I suspect that a metaphorical version of this is underway in your life. Certain choices you made in the past got supplanted by choices you made later. They disappeared from view. But now those older possibilities are re-emerging for your consideration. I'm not saying what you should do about them. I simply want to alert you to their ghostly presence so they don't cause confusion.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Love is a fire," declared Aries actress Joan Crawford. "But whether it's going to warm your hearth or burn down your house, you can never tell." I disagree with her conclusion. There are practical steps you can take to ensure that love's fire warms but doesn't burn. Start with these strategies: Suffuse your libido with compassion. Imbue your romantic fervor with empathy. Instill your animal passions and instinctual longings with affectionate tenderness. If you catch your sexual urges driving you toward narcissists who are no damn good for you, firmly redirect those sexual urges toward emotionally intelligent, self-responsible beauties.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Bible's Book of Exodus tells the story of the time Moses almost met God. "Show me your glory, please," the prophet says to his deity, who's hiding. "You cannot see my face," God replies, "but I will show you my back parts." That's good enough for Moses. He agrees. I hope that you, too, will be satisfied with a tantalizingly partial epiphany, Aries. I'm pretty sure that if you ask nicely, you can get a glimpse of a splendor that's as meaningful to you as God was to Moses. It may only be the "back parts," but that should still stir you and enrich you.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Do you know Emily Bront√´'s novel Wuthering Heights? At one point, the heroine Catherine tells her friend about Edgar, a man she's interested in. "He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace," Catherine says, "and I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine." If you're a typical Aries, you're more aligned with Catherine than with Edgar. But I'm hoping you might consider making a temporary compromise in the coming weeks. "At last, we agreed to try both," Catherine concluded, "and then we kissed each other and were friends."


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The next four weeks could potentially be a Golden Age of Friendship . . . a State of Grace for Your Web of Connections . . . a Lucky Streak for Collaborative Efforts. What can you do to ensure that these cosmic tendencies will actually be fulfilled? Try this: Deepen and refine your approach to schmoozing. Figure out what favors would be most fun for you to bestow, and bestow them. Don't socialize aimlessly with random gadabouts, but rather gravitate toward people with whom you share high ideals and strong intentions.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You love autonomy. You specialize in getting the freedom and sovereignty you require. You are naturally skilled at securing your independence from influences that might constrain your imagination and limit your self-expression. But here's a sticking point: If you want the power to help shape group processes, you must give up some of your autonomy. In order to motivate allies to work toward shared goals, you need to practice the art of interdependence. The next test of your ability to do this is coming right up.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

John Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. His novel Of Mice and Men helped win him the award, but it required extra persistence. When he'd almost finished the manuscript, he went out on a date with his wife. While they were gone, his puppy Toby ripped his precious pages into confetti. As mad as he was, he didn't punish the dog, but got busy on a rewrite. Later he considered the possibility that Toby had served as a helpful literary critic. The new edition of Of Mice and Men was Steinbeck's breakout book. I'm guessing that in recent months you have received comparable assistance, Aries -- although you may not realize it was assistance until later this year.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

John Koenig is an artist who invents new words. Here's one that's applicable to your journey in 2016: "keyframe." Koenig defines it as being a seemingly mundane phase of your life that is in fact a turning point. Major plot twists in your big story arrive half-hidden amidst a stream of innocuous events. They don't come about through "a series of jolting epiphanies," Koenig says, but rather "by tiny imperceptible differences between one ordinary day and the next." In revealing this secret, I hope I've alerted you to the importance of acting with maximum integrity and excellence in your everyday routine.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The raw materials you have at your disposal in 2016 may sometimes seem limited. You might not have access to all the tools you wish you did. You could be tempted to feel envy about the vaster resources other people can draw on. But I honestly don't think these apparent inhibitions will put you at a disadvantage. Within your smaller range of options, there will be all the possibilities you need. In fact, the constraints could stimulate your creativity in ways that would have never occurred if you'd had more options.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Neanderthals were a different human species that co-existed with our ancestors, homo sapiens, for at least 5,000 years. But they eventually died out while our people thrived. Why? One reason, says science writer Marcus Chown, is that we alone invented sewing needles. Our newborn babies had well-made clothes to keep them warm and healthy through frigid winters. Neanderthal infants, covered with ill-fitting animal skins, had a lower survival rate. Chown suggests that although this provided us with a mere one percent survival advantage, that turned out to be significant. I think you're ready to find and use a small yet ultimately crucial edge like that over your competitors, Aries.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Happiness sneaks through a door you didn't know that you left open," said actor John Barrymore. I hope you've left open a lot of those doors, Aries. The more there are, the happier you will be. This is the week of all weeks when joy, pleasure, and even zany bliss are likely to find their ways into your life from unexpected sources and unanticipated directions. If you're lucky, you also have a few forgotten cracks and neglected gaps where fierce delights and crisp wonders can come wandering in.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Charm is a way of getting the answer 'yes' without having asked any clear question," wrote French author Albert Camus. I have rarely seen you better poised than you are now to embody and capitalize on this definition of "charm," Aries. That's good news, right? Well, mostly. But there are two caveats. First, wield your mojo as responsibly as you can. Infuse your bewitching allure with integrity. Second, be precise about what it is you want to achieve -- even if you don't come right out and tell everyone what it is. Resist the temptation to throw your charm around haphazardly.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"We are torn between nostalgia for the familiar and an urge for the foreign and strange," wrote novelist Carson McCullers. "As often as not, we are homesick most for the places we have never known." I'm guessing that these days you're feeling that kind of homesickness, Aries. The people and places that usually comfort you don't have their customary power. The experiences you typically seek out to strengthen your stability just aren't having that effect. The proper response, in my opinion, is to go in quest of exotic and experimental stimuli. In ways you may not yet be able to imagine, they can provide the grounding you need. They will steady your nerves and bolster your courage.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Urbandictionary.com defines the English word "balter" as follows: "to dance without particular skill or grace, but with extreme joy." It's related to the Danish term baltre, which means "to romp, tumble, roll, cavort." I nominate this activity to be one of your ruling metaphors in the coming weeks. You have a mandate to explore the frontiers of amusement and bliss, but you have no mandate to be polite and polished as you do it. To generate optimal levels of righteous fun, your experiments may have to be more than a bit rowdy.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"I demand unconditional love and complete freedom," wrote Slovenian poet Toma¬û ¬äalamun. "That is why I am terrible." In accordance with the astrological omens, I'm offering you the chance, at least temporarily, to join ¬äalamun in demanding unconditional love and complete freedom. But unlike him, you must satisfy one condition: Avoid being terrible. Can you do that? I think so, although you will have to summon unprecedented amounts of emotional intelligence and collaborative ingenuity.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In 1978, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield began selling their new ice cream out of a refurbished gas station in Burlington, Vermont. Thirty-seven years later, Ben & Jerry's is among the world's best-selling ice cream brands. Its success stems in part from its willingness to keep transforming the way it does business. "My mantra is 'Change is a wonderful thing,'" says the current CEO. As evidence of the company's intention to keep re-evaluating its approach, there's a "Flavor Graveyard" on its website, where it lists flavors it has tried to sell but ultimately abandoned. "Wavy Gravy," "Tennessee Mud," and "Turtle Soup" are among the departed. Now is a favorable time for you to engage in a purge of your own, Aries. What parts of your life don't work any more? What personal changes would be wonderful things?


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

On a January morning in 1943, the town of Spearfish, South Dakota experienced very weird weather. At 7:30 a.m. the temperature was minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit. In the next two minutes, due to an unusual type of wind sweeping down over nearby Lookout Mountain, thermometers shot up 49 degrees. Over the next hour and a half, the air grew even warmer. But by 9:30, the temperature had plummeted back to minus 4 degrees. I'm wondering if your moods might swing with this much bounce in the coming weeks. As long as you keep in mind that no single feeling is likely to last very long, it doesn't have to be a problem. You may even find a way to enjoy the breathtaking ebbs and flows. Halloween costume suggestion: roller coaster rider, Jekyll and Hyde, warm clothes on one side of your body and shorts or bathing suit on the other.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to the online etymological dictionary, the verb "fascinate" entered the English language in the 16th century. It was derived from the Middle French fasciner and the Latin fascinatus, which  are translated as "bewitch, enchant, put under a spell." In the 19th century, "fascinate" expanded in meaning to include "delight, attract, hold the attention of." I suspect you will soon have experiences that could activate both senses of "fascinate." My advice is to get the most out of your delightful attractions without slipping into bewitchment. Is that even possible? It will require you to exercise fine discernment, but yes, it is.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Here's actor Bill Murray's advice about relationships: "If you have someone that you think is The One, don't just say, 'OK, let's pick a date. Let's get married.' Take that person and travel around the world. Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to go to places that are hard to go to and hard to get out of. And if, when you come back, you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport." In the coming weeks, Aries, I suggest you make comparable moves to test and deepen your own closest alliances. See what it's like to get more seriously and deliriously intimate.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If I warned you not to trust anyone, I hope you would reject my simplistic fear-mongering. If I suggested that you trust everyone unconditionally, I hope you would dismiss my delusional naivet√©. But it's important to acknowledge that the smart approach is far more difficult than those two extremes. You've got to evaluate each person and even each situation on a case-by-case basis. There may be unpredictable folks who are trustworthy some of the time, but not always. Can you be both affably open-hearted and slyly discerning? It's especially important that you do so in the next 16 days.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The next seven weeks will NOT be a favorable time to fool around with psychic vampires and charismatic jerks. I recommend you avoid the following mistakes, as well: failing to protect the wounded areas of your psyche; demanding perfection from those you care about; and trying to fulfill questionable desires that have led you astray in the past. Now I'll name some positive actions you'd be wise to consider: hunting for skillful healers who can relieve your angst and aches; favoring the companionship of people who are empathetic and emotionally intelligent; and getting educated about how to build the kind of intimacy you can thrive on.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You are destined to become a master of fire. It's your birthright to become skilled in the arts of kindling and warming and illuminating and energizing. Eventually you will develop a fine knack for knowing when it's appropriate to turn the heat up high, and when it's right to simmer with a slow, steady glow. You will wield your flames with discernment and compassion, rarely or never with prideful rage. You will have a special power to accomplish creative destruction and avoid harmful destruction. I'm pleased at the progress you are making toward these noble goals, but there's room for improvement. During the next eight weeks, you can speed up your evolution.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I won't go so far as to say that you are surrounded by unhinged maniacs whose incoherence is matched only by their self-delusion. That would probably be too extreme. But I do suspect that at least some of the characters in the game you're playing are not operating at their full potential. For now, it's best not to confront them and demand that they act with more grace. The wiser strategy might be to avoid being swept up in their agitation as you take good care of yourself. If you are patient and stay centered, I bet you will eventually get a chance to work your magic.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"More and more I have come to admire resilience," writes Jane Hirshfield in her poem "Optimism." "Not the simple resistance of a pillow," she adds, "whose foam returns over and over to the same shape, but the sinuous tenacity of a tree: finding the light newly blocked on one side, it turns in another." You have not often had great access to this capacity in the past, Aries. Your specialty has been the fast and fiery style of adjustment. But for the foreseeable future, I'm betting you will be able to summon a supple staying power -- a dogged, determined, incremental kind of resilience.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Excess is the common substitute for energy," said poet Marianne Moore. That's a problem you should watch out for in the coming weeks. According to my astrological projections, you're a bit less lively and dynamic than usual. And you may be tempted to compensate by engaging in extreme behavior or resorting to a contrived show of force. Please don't! A better strategy would be to recharge your power. Lay low and take extra good care of yourself. Get high-quality food, sleep, entertainment, art, love, and relaxation.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You like to run ahead of the pack. You prefer to show people the way, to set the pace. It's cleaner that way, right? There's less risk you will be caught up in the messy details of everyday compromise. But I suspect that the time is right for you to try an experiment: Temporarily ease yourself into the middle of the pack. Be willing to deal with the messy details of everyday compromise. Why? Because it will teach you lessons that will serve you well the next time you're showing the way and setting the pace.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You'd probably prefer to stay in the romantic, carefree state of mind. But from what I can tell, you're ripe for a new phase of your long-term cycle. Your freestyle rambles and jaunty adventures should now make way for careful introspection and thoughtful adjustments. Instead of restless star-gazing, I suggest patient earth-gazing. Despite how it may initially appear, it's not a comedown. In fact, I see it as an unusual reward that will satisfy you in unexpected ways.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To ensure the full accuracy of this horoscope, I have been compelled to resurrect an old-fashioned English word that isn't used much any more: "gambol." It means to cavort and frolic in a playful manner, or to romp and skip around with mad glee, as if you are unable to stop yourself from dancing. The astrological omens seem unambiguous in their message: In order to cultivate the state of mind that will enable you to meet all your dates with destiny in the coming weeks, you need to gambol at least once every day.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Charles de Lint is a novelist whose stories are influenced by folklore, myths, and science fiction. In his book Yarrow, a wizardly character named Toby is skilled at conjuring. He can make small objects appear and disappear, for example. But Toby yearns for more. "I want to be magic," he says. "I want to be a friend of elves and live in a tree. I want to marry a moonbeam and hear the stars sing. I don¬ít want to pretend at magic anymore. I want to be magic." If you have ever wished for a comparable upgrade, Aries, now is an unusually favorable time to work on it.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"I am very much in love with no one in particular," says actor Ezra Miller. His statement would make sense coming out of your mouth right about now. So would this one: "I am very much in love with almost everyone I encounter." Or this one: "I am very much in love with the wind and moon and hills and rain and rivers." Is this going to be a problem? How will you deal with your overwhelming urge to overflow? Will you break people's hearts and provoke uproars everywhere you go, or will you rouse delight and bestow blessings? As long as you take yourself lightly, I foresee delight and blessings.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Latin motto "Carpe diem" shouldn't be translated as "Seize the day!", says author Nicholson Baker. It's not a battle cry exhorting you to "freaking grab the day in your fist like a burger at a fairground and take a big chomping bite out of it." The proper translation, according to Baker, is "Pluck the day." In other words, "you should gently pull on the day¬ís stem, as if it were a wildflower, holding it with all the practiced care of your thumb and the side of your finger, which knows how to not crush easily crushed things -- so that the day's stem undergoes increasing tension and draws to a tightness, and then snaps softly away at its weakest point, and the flower is released in your hand." Keep that in mind, Aries. I understand you are often tempted to seize rather than pluck, but these days plucking is the preferable approach.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Stop Making Sense" was originally the name of the film and music soundtrack produced by the Talking Heads in the 1980s, and now it is the central theme of your horoscope. I think your brain would benefit from a thorough washing. That's why I invite you to scour it clean of all the dust and cobwebs and muck that have accumulated there since its last scrub a few months back. One of the best ways to launch this healing purge is, of course, to flood all the neural pathways with a firehose-surge of absurdity, jokes, and silliness. As the wise physician of the soul, Dr. Seuss, said, "I like nonsense. It wakes up the brain cells."


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

How can you fulfill your potential as an Aries? What strategies will help you become the best Aries you can possibly be? Now is an excellent time to meditate on these riddles. One of my Aries readers, Mickki Langston, has some stellar tips to inspire you: 1. One of your greatest assets is your relentless sense of purpose. Treasure it. Stay connected to it. Draw on it daily. 2. Love what you love with pure conviction, because there is no escaping it. 3. Other people may believe in you, but only sometimes. That's why you should unfailingly believe in yourself. 4. It's your duty and your destiny to continually learn more about how to be a leader. 5. Don't be confused by other people's confusion. 6. Your best friend is the Fool, who will guide you to laughter and humility when you need it most, which is pretty much all of the time.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To determine whether you are aligned with the cosmic flow, please answer the following questions. 1. Would you say that your current situation is more akin to treading water in a mosquito-ridden swamp, or conducting a ritual of purification in a clear mountain stream? 2. Have you been wrestling with boring ghosts and arguing with traditions that have lost most of their meaning? Or have you been transforming your past and developing a riper relationship with your roots? 3. Are you stuck in a gooey muck? Or are you building a flexible new foundation?


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

During my regular hikes along my favorite trails, I've gotten to know the local boulders quite intimately. It might sound daft, but I've come to love them. I've even given some of them names. They symbolize stability and constancy to me. When I gaze at them or sit on them, I feel my own resolve grow stronger. They teach me about how to be steadfast and unflappable in all kinds of weather. I draw inspiration from the way they are so purely themselves, forever true to their own nature. Now would be an excellent time for you to hang out with your own stony allies, Aries. You could use a boost in your ability to express the qualities they embody.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Would you like to stop pushing and struggling for a while? Is there a clenched attitude you would love to let go of? Do you wish you could take a break from having to give so much and try so hard and be so strong? Then do it! Now would be a good time to take a sabbatical from any situation that feels too demanding or frustrating. You wouldn't incur the wrath of the gods or the twists of karma if you sneaked away to indulge in some recreational frivolity. For the foreseeable future, "relax" and "surrender" are your words of power.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"To look at a thing hard and straight and seriously -- to fix it." Aries author Henry James said he wanted to do that on a regular basis. He didn't want to be "arbitrary" or "mechanical" in his efforts. I invite you to make this perspective one of your specialties in the coming weeks, Aries. Pick out a tweaked situation you'd like to mend or a half-spoiled arrangement you want to heal. Then pour your pure intelligence into it. Investigate it with a luminous focus. Use all your tough and tender insight to determine what needs to be transformed, and transform it.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Persian scholar Avicenna was so well-rounded in his knowledge that he wrote two different encyclopedias. Even as a teenager he was obsessed with learning all he could. He got especially consumed with trying to master Aristotle's Metaphysics, which did not easily yield its secrets to him. He read it 40 times, memorizing every word. When he finally understood it, he was so excited he celebrated by giving out money and gifts to destitute strangers. I suspect you will soon be having an equivalent breakthrough, Aries. At last you will grasp a truth that has eluded you for a long time. Congratulations in advance!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Keith Moon played drums for the rock band the Who. He was once voted the second-greatest drummer  in history. But his erratic behavior, often provoked by drugs or alcohol, sometimes interfered with his abilities. In 1973, the Who was doing a live concert near San Francisco when the horse tranquilizer that Moon had taken earlier caused him to pass out. The band appealed to the audience for help. "Can anybody play the drums?" asked guitarist Pete Townshend. "I mean somebody good?" A 19-year-old amateur drummer named Scot Halpin volunteered. He played well enough to finish the show. I suspect that sometime soon, Aries, you may also get an unexpected opportunity to play the role of a substitute. Be ready!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

James McNeil Whistler was an influential painter in the latter half of the 19th century. He advocated the "art for art's sake" credo, insisting that the best art doesn't need to teach or moralize. As far as he was concerned, its most important purpose was to bring forth "glorious harmony" from chaos. But the immediate reason I'm nominating him to be your patron saint for the coming weeks is the stylized signature he created: an elegant butterfly with a long tail that was actually a stinger. I think you'll thrive by embodying that dual spirit: being graceful, sensitive, and harmonious and yet also feisty, piquant, and provocative. Can you manage that much paradox? I think you can.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The danger of resisting a temptation too strenuously is that the temptation might depart. I suggest that you prevent that from happening. Without throwing yourself at the mercy of the temptation, see if you can coax it to stick around for a while longer. Why? In my view, it's playing a useful role in your life. It's motivating you to change some things that really do need to be changed. On the other hand, I'm not yet sure that it should become anything more than a temptation. It might serve you best that way, not as an object of your satisfied desire. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Benedictine monks observe the Latin motto Laborare est Orare. The 19th-century abbot Maurus Wolter interpreted these words to mean "work is worship" or "work is prayer." He was trying to impress upon his fellow monks that the work they did was not a grudging distraction from their service to God, but rather at the heart of their devotion. To do their tasks with love was a way to express gratitude for having been blessed with the gift of life. I propose that you experiment with this approach in the coming weeks, even if your version is more secular. What would it be like to feel contentment with and appreciation for the duties you have been allotted?


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Chris Moneymaker was employed as an accountant in Tennessee. On a whim, he paid $39 to enter an online poker tournament. Although he knew a lot about the game, he had never competed professionally. Nevertheless, he won the tournament. As his award, he received no money, but rather an invitation to participate in the annual World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. Can you guess the storybook ending? The rookie triumphed over 838 pros, taking home $2.5 million. I don't foresee anything quite as spectacular for you, Aries, but there may be similar elements in your saga. For example, a modest investment on your part could make you eligible for a chance to earn much more. Here's another possible plot twist: You could generate luck for yourself by ramping up a skill that has until now been a hobby.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you're stumped about what present to give someone for a special occasion, you might buy him or her a gift card. It's a piece of plastic that can be used as cash to buy stuff at a store. The problem is, a lot of people neglect to redeem their gift cards. They leave them in drawers and forget about them. Financial experts say there are currently billions of dollars going to waste on unredeemed gift cards. This is your metaphor of the moment, Aries. Are there any resources you're not using? Any advantages you're not capitalizing on? Any assets you're ignoring? If so, fix the problem. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The California Gold Rush hit its peak between 1849 and 1855. Three hundred thousand adventurers flocked to America's West Coast in search of gold. In the early days, gold nuggets were lying around on the ground in plain sight, or relatively easy to find in gravel beds at the bottom of streams. But later prospectors had to work harder, developing methods to extract the gold from rocks that contained it. One way to detect the presence of the precious metal was through the use of nitric acid, which corroded any substance that wasn't gold. The term "acid test" refers to that process. I bring this to your attention, Aries, because it's a good time for you to use the metaphorical version of an acid test as you ascertain whether what you have discovered is truly golden.


Aries (March 21-April 19)
Uitwaaien is a Dutch word that means to go out for a stroll in windy weather simply because it's exhilarating. I don't know any language that has parallel terms for running in the rain for the dizzy joy of it, or dancing through a meadow in the dark because it's such nonsensical fun, or singing at full volume while riding alone in an elevator in the mad-happy quest to purge your tension. But in the coming weeks, you don't need to describe or explain experiences like this; you just need to do them. Experiment with giving your instinctive need for exuberance lots of room to play.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Choconiverous" is an English slang word that's defined as having the tendency, when eating a chocolate Easter Bunny, to bite the head off first. I recommend that you adopt this direct approach in everything you do in the coming weeks. Don't get bogged down with preliminaries. Don't get sidetracked by minor details, trivial distractions, or peripheral concerns. It's your duty to swoop straight into the center of the action. Be clear about what you want and unapologetic about getting it. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The term "jumped the shark" often refers to a TV show that was once great but gradually grew stale, and then resorted to implausible plot twists in a desperate attempt to revive its creative verve. I'm a little worried that you may do the equivalent of jumping the shark in your own sphere. APRIL FOOL! I lied. I'm not at all worried that you'll jump the shark. It's true that you did go through a stagnant, meandering phase there for a short time. But you responded by getting fierce and fertile rather than stuck and contrived. Am I right? And now you're on the verge of breaking out in a surge of just-the-right-kind-of-craziness.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You're entering a time and space known as the Adlib Zone. In this territory, fertile chaos and inspirational uncertainty are freely available. Improvised formulas will generate stronger mojo than timeworn maxims. Creativity is de rigueur, and street smarts count for more than book-learning. May I offer some mottoes to live by when "common sense" is inadequate? 1. Don't be a slave to necessity. 2. Be as slippery as you can be and still maintain your integrity. 3. Don't just question authority; be thrilled about every chance you get to also question habit, tradition, fashion, trendiness, apathy, and dogma.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the old Superman comics, Mister Mxyztplk was a fiendish imp whose home was in the fifth dimension. He sometimes sneaked over into our world to bedevil the Man of Steel with pranks. There was one sure way he could be instantly banished back to his own realm for a long time: If Superman fooled him into saying his own name backwards. You might think it would be hard to trick a magic rascal into saying "Klptzyxm" when he knew very well what the consequences would be, but Superman usually succeeded. I'd like to suggest that you have a similar power to get rid of a bugaboo that has been bothering you, Aries. Don't underestimate your ability to outsmart the pest.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To depict what lay beyond the limits of the known world, medieval mapmakers sometimes drew pictures of dragons and sea serpents. Their images conveyed the sense that these territories were uncharted and perhaps risky to explore. There were no actual beasties out there, of course. I think it's possible you're facing a comparable situation. The frontier realm you are wandering through may seem to harbor real dragons, but I'm guessing they are all of the imaginary variety. That's not to say you should entirely let down your guard. Mix some craftiness in with your courage. Beware of your mind playing tricks.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Lately your life reminds me of the action film Speed, starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. In that story, a criminal has rigged a passenger bus to explode if its speed drops below 50 miles per hour. In your story, you seem to be acting as if you, too, will self-destruct if you stop moving at a frantic pace. I'm here to tell you that nothing bad will happen if you slow down. Just the opposite, in fact. As you clear your schedule of its excessive things-to-do, as you leisurely explore the wonders of doing nothing in particular, I bet you will experience a soothing flood of healing pleasure.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

There are many different facets to your intelligence, and each matures at a different rate. So for example, your ability to think symbolically may evolve more slowly than your ability to think abstractly. Your wisdom about why humans act the way they do may ripen more rapidly than your insight into your own emotions. In the coming weeks, I expect one particular aspect of your intelligence to be undergoing a growth spurt: your knowledge of what your body needs and how to give it what it needs.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I hope you have someone in your life to whom you can send the following love note, and if you don't, I trust you will locate that someone no later than August 1: "I love you more than anyone loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that no one loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that I love no one else, and never have loved anyone else, and never will love anyone else." (This passage is borrowed from author Jonathan Safran Foer's book Everything Is Illuminated.)


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In 1979, Monty Python comedian John Cleese helped direct a four-night extravaganza, The Secret Policeman's Ball. It was a benefit to raise money for the human rights organization Amnesty International. The musicians known as Sting, Bono, and Peter Gabriel later testified that the show was a key factor in igniting their social activism. I see the potential of a comparable stimulus in your near future, Aries. Imminent developments could amp up your passion for a good cause that transcends your immediate self-interests.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Do you have an entourage or posse that helps you work magic you can't conjure up alone? Is there a group of co-conspirators that prods you to be brave and farseeing? If not, try to whip one up. And if you do have an inspirational crew, brainstorm about some new adventures for all of you to embark on. Scheme and dream about the smart risks and educational thrills you could attempt together. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you especially need the sparkle and rumble that a feisty band of allies can incite.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Is there a patron saint of advertising or a goddess of marketing or a power animal that rules publicity and promotion? If so, I'm going to find out, then pray to them in your behalf. It's high time for your underappreciated talents and unsung accomplishments to receive more attention. And I am convinced that the astrological moment is ripe for just such a development. Help me out here, Aries. What can you do to get your message out better? What tricks do you have for attracting the interest of those who don't know yet about your wonders?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You will never make anything that lasts forever. Nor will I or anyone else. I suppose it's possible that human beings will still be listening to Beethoven's music or watching The Simpsons TV show 10,000 years from today, but even that stuff will probably be gone in five billion years, when the sun expands into a red giant star. Having acknowledged that hard truth, I'm happy to announce that in the next five weeks you could begin work in earnest on a creation that will endure for a very long time. What will it be? Choose wisely!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In his novel Breakfast of Champions, Kurt Vonnegut describes a character, Ned Lingamon, who "had a penis eight hundred miles long and two hundred and ten miles in diameter, but practically all of it was in the fourth dimension." If there is any part of you that metaphorically resembles Lingamon, Aries, the coming months will be a favorable time to fix the problem. You finally have sufficient power and wisdom and feistiness to start expressing your latent capacities in practical ways . . . to manifest your hidden beauty in a tangible form . . . to bring your purely fourth-dimensional aspects all the way into the third dimension.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Most salamanders reproduce by laying eggs, but the alpine salamander doesn't. Females of that species give birth to live young after long pregnancies that may last three years. What does this have to do with you? Well, I expect you to experience a metaphorical pregnancy in the coming months. Even if you're male, you will be gestating a project or creation or inspiration. And it's important that you don't let the incubation period drag on and on and on, as the alpine salamanders do. I suggest you give birth no later than July. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Hell is the suffering of being unable to love," wrote novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Using that definition, I'm happy to announce that you have a good chance of avoiding hell altogether in 2015. If there has been any deficiency in your power to express and bestow love, I think you will correct it. If you have been so intent on getting love that you have been neglectful in giving love, you will switch your focus. I invite you to keep a copy of this horoscope in your wallet for the next 12 months. Regard it as your "Get Out of Hell Free" card.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Too much happiness can make you unhappy," reported journalist Marta Zaraska in the Washington Post. Citing research by psychologists, she concluded that being super-extra cheerful can make you selfish, gullible, and more prone to stereotyped thinking. On the other hand, she said, maintaining merely moderate levels of happiness is pretty damn good for your mental and physical health. So here's the takeaway, Aries: The astrological omens suggest you're due for a surge of joy and pleasure. Just be careful it doesn't spill over into rash, delirious excess. Here's your watchword: well-grounded delight.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Lord Byron (1788-1824) was an English poet who loved animals. In the course of his life, he not only had dogs and cats as pets, but also monkeys, horses, peacocks, geese, a crocodile, a falcon, a crane, and a parrot. When he enrolled in Trinity College at age 17, he was upset that the school's rules forbade students from having pet dogs, which meant he couldn't bring his adored Newfoundland dog Boatswain. There was no regulation, however, against having a tame bear as a pet. So Byron got one and named it Bruin. I think it's time for you to find a workaround like that, Aries. Be cunning. Try a gambit or two. Find a loophole.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The National Science Foundation estimates that we each think at least 12,000 thoughts per day. The vast majority of them, however, are reruns of impressions that have passed through our minds many times before. But I am pleased to report that in the coming weeks, you Aries folks are primed to be far less repetitive than normal. You have the potential to churn out a profusion of original ideas, fresh perceptions, novel fantasies, and pertinent questions. Take full advantage of this opportunity. Brainstorm like a genius.  


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What exactly do you believe in, Aries? What's your philosophy of life? Do you think that most people are basically good and that you can make a meaningful life for yourself if you just work hard and act kind? Do you believe that evil, shapeshifting, kitten-eating extraterrestrials have taken on human form and are impersonating political leaders who control our society? Are you like the character Crash Davis in the film Bull Durham, who believed in "high fiber, good scotch, the sweet spot, and long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days"? Now would be an excellent time for you to get very clear about the fundamental principles that guide your behavior. Re-commit yourself to your root beliefs -- and jettison the beliefs that no longer work for you.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Someone on Reddit.com posed the question, "What have you always been curious to try?" In reply, many people said they wanted to experiment with exotic varieties of sex and drugs they had never treated themselves to before. Other favorites: eating chocolate-covered bacon; piloting a plane; shoplifting; doing a stand-up comedy routine; hang-gliding and deep-sea diving; exploring the Darknet and the Deep Web; spontaneously taking a trip to a foreign country; turning away from modern society and joining a Buddhist monastery. What would your answer be, Aries? The coming weeks will be an excellent time to explore what you have always been curious to try. The risks will be lower than usual, and the results more likely to be interesting.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

We all have addictive and obsessive tendencies. They are fundamental to being human. So the challenge is not to eliminate them -- that's not possible -- but rather to harness them. If you hope to keep them from dragging you down, you must work hard to channel them into activities that enhance your life. How are you doing on this score, Aries? Are you chronically dependent on drugs, gambling, sugar, or chaotic relationships? Or are you, instead, hooked on the courage you summon when you face your fears and the willpower you invoke as you free yourself from your limitations? Now is an excellent time to upgrade your addictive and obsessive tendencies.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Shape-shifting is a common theme in fairy tales, says cultural historian Marina Warner in her book From the Beast to the Blonde. "A rusty lamp turns into an all-powerful talisman," for example. "A humble pestle and mortar become the winged vehicle of the fairy enchantress," or a slovenly beggar wearing a dirty donkeyskin transforms into a radiant princess. I foresee metaphorically similar events happening in your life sometime soon, Aries. Maybe they are already underway. Don't underestimate the magic that is possible.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you live in Gaza, you don't have easy access to Kentucky Fried Chicken. The closest KFC restaurant is 35 miles away in the Egyptian city of El-Arish. But there was a time when you could pay smugglers to bring it to you via one of the underground tunnels that linked Egypt to Gaza. Each delivery took four hours and required the help of two taxis, a hand cart, and a motorbike. (Alas, Egypt destroyed most of the tunnels in early 2014.) I recommend, Aries, that you be as determined and resourceful to make your longed-for connections as the KFC lovers in Gaza were. Halloween costume suggestion: smuggler, bootlegger, drug-dealer, black-marketeer.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The driest place on the planet is the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It gets about a half-inch of rain per year. And yet in 2011, archaeologists discovered that it's also home to a site containing the fossilized skeletons of numerous whales and other ancient sea creatures. I'm detecting a metaphorically comparable anomaly in your vicinity, Aries. A seemingly arid, empty part of your life harbors buried secrets that are available for you to explore. If you follow the clues, you may discover rich pickings that will inspire you to revise your history.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

New York City's Diamond District is home to over 2,000 businesses that buy and sell jewelry. Throughout the years, many people have lost bits of treasure here. Valuable bits of gold and gems have fallen off broken necklaces, earrings, watches, and other accessories. Now an enterprising man named Raffi Stepanian is cashing in. Using tweezers and a butter knife, he mines for the rich pickings that are packed in the mud of sidewalk cracks and gutters. "The percentage of gold out here on the street is greater than the amount of gold you would find in a mine," he says. I'd love to see you get inspired by his efforts, Aries. Dig for treasure in unlikely places where no one else would deign to look.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Situation #1: If you meet resistance or doubt, say this: "Ha! This diversion can't slow me down, because I am in possession of an invisible magical sword!" And then brandish a few charismatic swipes of your sword to prove that you mean business. Situation #2: If angst and worry are preventing your allies from synchronizing their assets with yours, say this: "Begone, dread! For with the power of my wicked crazy songs, I am the destroyer of fear." And then sing your wicked crazy songs. Situation #3: If you're finding it hard to discern the difference between useless, ugly monsters and useful, beautiful monsters, say this: "I am a useful, beautiful monster!" Your kind will flock to your side. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

As I hike through the wilderness at dusk, the crickets always seem to be humming in the distance. No matter where I go, their sound is farther off, never right up close to me. How can that be? Do they move away from me as I approach? I doubt it. I sense no leaping insects in the underbrush. Here's how this pertains to you: My relationship with the crickets' song is similar to a certain mystery in your life. There's an experience that calls to you but forever seems just out of reach. You think you're drawing nearer, about to touch it and be in its midst, but it inevitably eludes you. Now here's the good news: A change is coming for you. It will be like what would happen if I suddenly found myself intimately surrounded by hundreds of chirping crickets.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's no secret. The wealthy one percent of the population has been getting progressively wealthier. Meanwhile, the poor are becoming steadily poorer. I'm worried there is a metaphorically similar trend in your life. Am I right? If so, please do all you can to reverse it. Borrow energy from the rich and abundant parts of your life so as to lift up the neglected and underendowed parts. Here's one example of how you could proceed: For a while, be less concerned with people who think you're a star, and give more attention to those who accept and love your shadow side.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

These horoscopes I write for you aren't primarily meant to predict the future. They are more about uncovering hidden potentials and desirable possibilities that are stirring below the surface right now. When I'm doing my job well, I help you identify those seeds so you can cultivate them proactively. Bearing that in mind, I'll pose three pertinent questions. 1. What experiments might stir up more intimacy in the relationships you want to deepen? 2. What could you change about yourself to attract more of the love and care you want? 3. Is there anything you can do to diminish the sting of bad memories about past romantic encounters, thereby freeing you to love with more abandon?


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the 2000 film Cast Away, Tom Hanks plays an American FedEx executive who is stranded alone on a remote Pacific island after he survives a plane crash. A few items from the plane wash up on shore, including a volleyball. He draws a face on it and names it "Wilson," creating a companion who becomes his confidant for the next four years. I'd love to see you enlist an ally like Wilson in the coming week, Aries. There are some deep, messy, beautiful mysteries you need to talk about. At least for now, the only listener capable of drawing them out of you in the proper spirit might be a compassionate inanimate object that won't judge you or interrupt you.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I don't usually do this kind of thing, but I'm going to suggest that you monitor the number six. My hypothesis is that six has been trying to grab your attention, perhaps even in askew or inconvenient ways. Its purpose? To nudge you to tune in to beneficial influences that you have been ignoring. I furthermore suspect that six is angling to show you clues about what is both the cause of your unscratchable itch and the cure for that itch. So lighten up and have fun with this absurd mystery, Aries. Without taking it too seriously, allow six to be your weird little teacher. Let it prick your intuition with quirky notions and outlandish speculations. If nothing comes of it, there will be no harm done. If it leads you to helpful discoveries, hallelujah.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the coming weeks it will be important for you to bestow blessings and disseminate gifts and dole out helpful feedback. Maybe you already do a pretty good job at all that, but I urge you to go even further. Through acts of will and surges of compassion, you can and should raise your levels of generosity. Why? Your allies and loved ones need more from you than usual. They have pressing issues that you have special power to address. Moreover, boosting your largesse will heal a little glitch in your mental health. It's just what the soul doctor ordered.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

An American named Kevin Shelley accomplished a feat worthy of inclusion in the Guinness Book of World Records. While wearing a blue satin martial arts outfit, he smashed 46 wooden toilet seats over his head in just one minute. Some observers may be inclined to dismiss his efforts as frivolous and ridiculous. But I admire how he playfully mocked his own competitiveness while fully expressing his competitiveness. He satirized his ego's drive to be first and best even as achieved the goal of being first and best. I recommend you try something similar. You're entering a phase when you'll be wise to add a bit of humility to your bold self-presentation.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Researchers in Peru have recently tracked down many previously unknown varieties of wild cacao plants. What that means is that there are exotic kinds of chocolate that you and I have never dreamed of, and they will be commercially available within a few years. As delicious as your Chocolove XOXOX Extra Strong Dark candy bar may taste to you now, you will eventually journey further into a new frontier of ecstatic delectability. I propose that we use this theme as a metaphor for the work you have ahead of you right now. It is time for you to make good things even better -- to take fun diversions and transform them into experiences that engender transcendent bliss. Turn "yes" into "YESSSS!!!!"


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Don't just be smart and articulate, Aries. Dare to be wildly wise and prone to unruly observations. Don't merely be kind and well-behaved. Explore the mysteries of healing through benevolent mischief. Don't buy into the all-too-serious trances. Break up the monotony with your unpredictable play and funny curiosity. Don't simply go along with the stories everyone seems to believe in as if they were the Truth and the Way. Question every assumption; rebel against every foregone conclusion; propose amusing plot twists that send the narratives off on interesting tangents.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If a farmer plants the same crop in the same field year after year, the earth's nutrients get exhausted. For instance, lettuce sucks up a lot of nitrogen. It's better to plant beans or peas in that location the next season, since they add nitrogen back into the soil. Meanwhile, lettuce will do well in the field where the beans or peas grew last time. This strategy is called crop rotation. I nominate it as your operative metaphor for the next  ten months, Aries. Your creative output will be abundant if you keep sowing each new "crop" in a fertile situation where it is most likely to thrive.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A report in the prestigious British medical journal BMJ says that almost one percent of young pregnant women in the U.S. claim to be virgins. They testify that they have conceived a fetus without the benefit of sex. That's impossible, right? Technically, yes. But if there could ever be a loophole in natural law, it would happen for you Aries sometime in the coming weeks. You will be so exceptionally fertile, so prone to hatching new life, that almost anything could incite germination. A vivid dream or captivating idea or thrilling adventure or exotic encounter might be enough to do the trick.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"I have complete faith in the continued absurdity of whatever's going on," says satirical news commentator Jon Stewart. That's a healthy attitude. To do his work, he needs a never-ending supply of stories about people doing crazy, corrupt, and hypocritical things. I'm sure this subject matter makes him sad and angry. But it also stimulates him to come up with funny ideas that entertain and educate his audience -- and earns him a very good income. I invite you to try his approach, Aries. Have faith that the absurdity you experience can be used to your advantage.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What are the sources that heal and nourish you? Where do you go to renew yourself? Who are the people and animals that treat you the best and are most likely to boost your energy? I suggest that in the coming week you give special attention to these founts of love and beauty. Treat them with the respect and reverence they deserve. Express your gratitude and bestow blessings on them. It's the perfect time for you to summon an outpouring of generosity as you feed what feeds you.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Would you like your savings account to grow? Then deposit money into in it on a consistent basis. Would you like to feel good and have a lot of physical energy? Eat healthy food, sleep as much as you need to, and exercise regularly. Do you want people to see the best in you and give you the benefit of the doubt? See the best in them and give them the benefit of the doubt. Would you love to accomplish your most important goal? Decide what you want more than anything else and focus on it with relaxed intensity. Yes, Aries, life really is that simple -- or at least it is right now. If you want to attain interesting success, be a master of the obvious.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to an astrologer named Astrolocherry, Aries is the sign of the freedom fighter, the explorer, the daredevil, and the adventurer. That's all true; I agree with her. But here's an important caveat. As you get older, it's your duty to harness all that hot energy on behalf of the softer, slower, more tender parts of your life. The coming weeks will offer you a great opportunity to work on that challenge. To get started, imagine how you can be a freedom fighter, explorer, daredevil, and adventurer in service to your home, family, and community. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you were alive 150 years ago and needed to get a tooth extracted, you might have called on a barber or blacksmith or wigmaker to do the job. (Dentistry didn't become a formal occupation until the latter part of the 19th century.) Today you wouldn't dream of seeking anyone but a specialist to attend to the health of your mouth. But I'm wondering if you are being less particular about certain other matters concerning your welfare. Have you been seeking financial advice from your massage therapist? Spiritual counsel from your car repair person? Nutritional guidance from a fast-food addict? I suggest you avoid such behavior. It's time to ask for specific help from those who can actually provide it.

What will be the story of your life in the second half of 2014? How can you conspire with life to create the best possible future for yourself?

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"My music is best understood by children and animals," said composer Igor Stravinsky. A similar statement could be made about you Tauruses in the coming weeks: You will be best understood by children and animals -- and by all others who have a capacity for dynamic innocence and a buoyant curiosity rooted in emotional intelligence. In fact, those are the types I advise you to surround yourself with. For now, it's best to avoid sophisticates who overthink everything and know-it-all cynics whose default mode is criticism. Take control of what influences you absorb. You need to be in the presence of those who help activate your vitality and enthusiasm.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"Nikhedonia" is an obscure English word that refers to the pleasure that comes from anticipating success or good fortune. There's nothing wrong with indulging in this emotion as long as it doesn't interfere with you actually doing the work that will lead to success or good fortune. But the problem is, nikhedonia makes some people lazy. Having experienced the thrill of imagining their victory, they find it hard to buckle down and slog through the gritty details necessary to manifest their victory. Don't be like that. Enjoy your nikhedonia, then go and complete the accomplishment that will bring a second, even stronger wave of gratification.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Boston's Museum of Fine Arts has a collection of Japanese art that is never on display. It consists of 6,600 wood-block prints created by artists of the ukiyo-e school, also known as "pictures of the floating world." Some are over 300 years old. They are tucked away in drawers and hidden from the light, ensuring that their vibrant colors won't fade. So they are well-preserved but rarely seen by anyone. Is there anything about you that resembles these pictures of the floating world, Cancerian? Do you keep parts of you secret, protecting them from what might happen if you show them to the world? It may be time to revise that policy. (Thanks to Molly Oldfield's The Secret Museum for the info referred to here.)

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In the next two weeks, I hope you don't fall prey to the craze that has been sweeping Japan. Over 40,000 people have bought books that feature the photos of hamuketsu, or hamster bottoms. Even if you do manage to avoid being consumed by that particular madness, I'm afraid you might get caught up in trifles and distractions that are equally irrelevant to your long-term dreams. Here's what I suggest: To counteract any tendency you might have to neglect what's truly important, vow to focus intensely on what's truly important.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Writing at FastCompany.com, Himanshu Saxena suggests that businesses create a new position: Chief Paradox Officer, or CPXO. This person would be responsible for making good use of the conflicts and contradictions that normally arise, treating them as opportunities for growth rather than as distractions. From my astrological perspective, you Virgos are currently prime candidates to serve in this capacity. You will continue to have special powers to do this type of work for months to come.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

In accordance with the astrological omens, you are hereby granted a brief, one-time-only license to commit the Seven Deadly Sins. You heard me correctly, Libra. As long as you don't go to extremes, feel free to express healthy amounts of pride, greed, laziness, gluttony, anger, envy, and lust. At least for now, there will be relatively little hell to pay for these indulgences. Just one caveat: If I were you, I wouldn't invest a lot of energy in anger and envy. Technically, they are permitted, but they aren't really much fun. On the other hand, greed, gluttony, and lust could be quite pleasurable, especially if you don't take yourself too seriously. Pride and laziness may also be enjoyable in moderate, artful amounts.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Scorpio novelist Kurt Vonnegut rebelled against literary traditions. His stories were often hybrids of science fiction and autobiography. Free-form philosophizing blended with satirical moral commentary. He could be cynical yet playful, and he told a lot of jokes. "I want to stand as close to the edge as I can without going over," he testified. "Out on the edge you see all the kinds of things you can¬ít see from the center." He's your role model for the next four weeks, Scorpio. Your challenge will be to wander as far as you can into the frontier without getting hopelessly lost.

What will be the story of your life in the second half of 2014? How can you conspire with life to create the best possible future for yourself?

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"Make a name for the dark parts of you," writes Lisa Marie Basile in her poem "Paz." I think that's good advice for you, Sagittarius. The imminent future will be an excellent time to fully acknowledge the shadowy aspects of your nature. More than that, it will be a perfect moment to converse with them, get to know them better, and identify their redeeming features. I suspect you will find that just because they are dark doesn't mean they are bad or shameful. If you approach them with love and tenderness, they may even reveal their secret genius.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Pet mice that are kept in cages need to move more than their enclosed space allows, so their owners often provide them with exercise wheels. If the rodents want to exert their natural instinct to run around, they've got to do it on this device. But here's a curious twist: a team of Dutch researchers has discovered that wild mice also enjoy using exercise wheels. The creatures have all the room to roam they need, but when they come upon the wheels in the middle of the forest, they hop on and go for prolonged spins. I suggest you avoid behavior like that, Capricorn. Sometime soon you will find yourself rambling through more spacious places. When that happens, don't act like you do when your freedom is more limited.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

It's transition time. We will soon see how skilled you are at following through. The innovations you have launched in recent weeks need to be fleshed out. The creativity you unleashed must get the full backing of your practical action. You will be asked to make good on the promises you made or even implied. I want to urge you not to get your feelings hurt if some pruning and editing are required. In fact, I suggest you relish the opportunity to translate fuzzy ideals into tidy structures. Practicing the art of ingenious limitation will make everything better.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

It's always important for you to shield yourself against our culture's superficial and sexist ideas about sex. It's always important for you to cultivate your own unique and soulful understandings about sex. But right now this is even more crucial than usual. You are headed into a phase when you will have the potential to clarify and deepen your relationship with eros. In ways you have not previously imagined, you can learn to harness your libido to serve both your spiritual aspirations and your quest for greater intimacy.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In its quest for nectar, a hummingbird sips from a thousand flowers every day. As it flaps its wings 70 times a second, zipping from meal to meal, it can fly sideways, backward, or forward. If it so desires, it can also hover or glide upside-down. It remembers every flower it visits, and knows how long it will take before each flower will produce a new batch of nectar. To some Spanish speakers, hummingbirds are known as joyas voladoras, or "flying jewels." Now take everything I've just said, Aries, and use it as a metaphor for who you can be in the coming week.



You're got more strength and intelligence than you realize. For help in accessing those untapped inner resources, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"We are born with whirlwinds, forest fires, and comets inside us," writes novelist Robert R. McCammon. "We are born able to sing to birds and read the clouds and see our destiny in grains of sand. But then we get the magic educated right out of our souls. We get it churched out, spanked out, washed out, and combed out. We get put on the straight and narrow path and told to be responsible." That's the bad news, Aries. But now here's the good news: The next 12 months will offer you a series of excellent opportunities to re-magic yourself. If you have not yet caught wind of the first invitation, I bet you will soon.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"When I was young," wrote French author Albert Camus, "I expected people to give me more than they could -- continuous friendship, permanent emotion." That didn't work out so well for him. Over and over, he was awash in disappointment. "Now I have learned to expect less of them than they can give," he concluded. "Their emotions, their friendship, and noble gestures keep their full miraculous value in my eyes; wholly the fruit of grace." I'd love to see you make an adjustment like this in the coming months, Aries. If you do, the astrological omens suggest you will experience a blessing like Camus'.



"Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show." So begins Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield. I'd like to inspire you to write a story of your own that begins like that. For help, tune into your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I believe your persuasive powers will be stronger than usual in the weeks ahead. The words coming out of your mouth will sound especially interesting. I also suspect that your intelligence will get at least a temporary upgrade. The clarity of your thoughts will intensify. You will see truths you have been blind to in the past. Innovative solutions to long-running dilemmas are likely to occur to you. The only potential snag is that you might neglect to nurture your emotional riches. You could become a bit too dry and hard. But now that I've warned you of that possibility, let's hope you will take steps to ensure it won't happen.



How are you going to change what needs to be changed and accept what needs to be accepted? To get some support from me, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When the path ahead divides in two, Aries, I am hoping you can work some magic that will allow you to take both ways at once. If you do master this riddle, if you can creatively figure out how to split yourself without doing any harm, I have a strong suspicion that the two paths will once again come together no later than August 1, possibly before. But due to a curious quirk in the laws of life, the two forks will never again converge if you follow just one of them now.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Fireworks displays excite the eyes and lift the spirit. But the smoke and dust they produce can harm the lungs with residues of heavy metals. The toxic chemicals they release may pollute streams and lakes and even groundwater. So is there any alternative? Not yet. No one has come up with a more benign variety of fireworks. But if it happens soon, I bet it will be due to the efforts of an enterprising Aries researcher. Your tribe is entering a phase when you will have good ideas about how to make risky fun safer, how to ensure vigorous adventures are healthy, and how to maintain constructive relationships with exciting influences.



I invite you to keep a running list of all the ways life delights you and helps you and energizes you. Describe everyday miracles you take for granted . . . the uncanny powers you possess . . . the small joys that occur so routinely you forget how much they mean to you . . . the steady flow of benefits bestowed on you by people you know and don't know. What works for you? What makes you feel at home in the world? For inspiration in this noble effort, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Dear Astrologer: We Aries people have an intense fire burning inside us. It's an honor and a privilege. We're lucky to be animated with such a generous share of the big energy that gives life to all of nature. But sometimes the fire gets too wild and strong for us. We can't manage it. It gets out of our control. That's how I'm feeling lately. These beloved flames that normally move me and excite me are now the very thing that's making me crazy. What to do? - Aries." Dear Aries: Learn from what firefighters do to fight forest fires. They use digging tools to create wide strips of dirt around the fire, removing all the flammable brush and wood debris. When the fire reaches this path, it's deprived of fuel. Close your eyes and visualize that scene.



Sometimes it's a challenge to try to figure out what's important and what's not important. If you'd like more of my input, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If for some inexplicable reason you are not simmering with new ideas about how you could drum up more money, I don't know what to tell you -- except that maybe your mother lied to you about exactly when you were born. The astrological omens are virtually unequivocal: If you are a true Aries, you are now being invited, teased, and even tugged to increase your cash flow and bolster your financial know-how. If you can't ferret out at least one opportunity to get richer quicker, you might really be a Pisces or Taurus. And my name is Jay Z.



No one knows you better than you do, but maybe I can help you dig up even more self-knowledge. Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's Compensation Week. If you have in the past suffered from injustice, it's an excellent time to go in quest of restitution. If you have been deprived of the  beauty you need to thrive, now is the time to get filled up. Wherever your life has been out of balance, you have the power to create more harmony. Don't be shy about seeking redress. Ask people to make amends. Pursue restorations. But don't, under any circumstances, lust for revenge.



All of creation loves you very much. Even now, people you know and people you don't know are collaborating to make sure you have all you need to make your next smart move. But are you willing to start loving life back with an equal intensity? The adoration it offers you has not exactly been unrequited, but there is room for you to be more demonstrative. For help in cultivating this approach, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Freedom is the most important kind of joy you can seek right now. It's also the most important subject to study and think about, as well as the most important skill to hone. I advise you to make sure that freedom is flowing through your brain and welling up in your heart and spiraling through your loins. Write synonyms for "freedom" on your arm with a felt-tip pen: liberation, emancipation, independence, leeway, spaciousness, carte blanche, self-determination, dispensation. Here's one more tip: Connect yourself with people who love and cultivate the same type of freedom you do.



How well is your imagination working these days? Could it use a boost? A prod? A jolt of inspiration? Try tuning in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera says that the brain has "a special area which we might call poetic memory and which records everything that charms or touches us, that makes our lives beautiful." In the coming days, it will be especially important for you to tap into this power spot in your own grey matter, Aries. You need to activate and stir up the feelings of enchantment that are stored there. Doing so will make you fully alert and available for the new delights that will be swirling in your vicinity. The operative principle is like attracts like.



Wouldn't you love to learn more about who you really are? What better adventure is there than learning about your soul's code? For more hints, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I have coined a new word just for your horoscope this week. It's "zex," short for "zen sex." Zex is a kind of sex in which your mind is at rest, empty of all thoughts. You breathe slowly and calmly, move slowly and calmly, grunt and moan slowly and calmly. You are completely detached from the sensual pleasure you are experiencing. You have no goals other than the intention to be free of all goals. Zex is the ONLY variety of sex I recommend for you right now, Aries. APRIL FOOL! I lied. Zex may be fine to practice at any other time, but not these days. The style of sex you need most is exuberant, unbridled, expansive, and even zany. 



What is the obvious secret you can't quite see? How could you turn your challenges into daily gifts for yourself? For clues to mysteries like these, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"When you plant seeds in the garden, you don¬ít dig them up every day to see if they have sprouted yet," says Buddhist nun Thubten Chodron. "You simply water them and clear away the weeds; you know that the seeds will grow in time." That's sound advice for you, Aries. You are almost ready to plant the metaphorical seeds that you will be cultivating in the coming months. Having faith should be a key element in your plans for them. You've got to find a way to shut down any tendencies you might have to be an impatient control freak. Your job is simply to give your seeds a good start and provide them with the persistent follow-up care they will need.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"There was another life that I might have had, but I am having this one." So says a character in Kazuo Ishiguro's novel The Unconsoled. At this juncture in your life story, Aries, it might be healing for you to make a similar declaration. Now is an excellent moment to say a final goodbye to plot twists that you wished would have happened but never did. To do so will free up stuck energy that will then become available for future projects. You may even awaken to exciting possibilities you haven't imagined yet.



I hope the oracle above provides you with the inspiration you need to do what you've got to do and change what needs to be changed. But if you need more clues, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE, where I go further in exploring your mysteries.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Are you between jobs? Between romantic partners? Between secure foundations and clear mandates and reasons to get up each morning? Probably at least one of the above. Foggy whirlwinds may be your intimate companions. Being up-in-the-air could be your customary vantage point. During your stay in this weird vacationland, please abstain from making conclusions about its implications for your value as a human being. Remember these words from author Terry Braverman: "It is important to detach our sense of self-worth from transitional circumstances, and maintain perspective on who we are by enhancing our sense of 'self-mirth.'" Whimsy and levity can be your salvation, Aries. Lucky flux should be your mantra.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The battles you've been waging these last ten months have been worthy of you. They've tested your mettle and grown your courage. But I suspect that your relationship with these battles is due for a shift. In the future they may not serve you as well as they have up until now. At the very least, you will need to alter your strategy and tactics. It's also possible that now is the time to leave them behind entirely -- to graduate from them and search for a new cause that will activate the next phase of your evolution as an enlightened warrior. What do you think?



Grace emerges in the ebb and flow, not just the flow. The waning reveals a different blessing than the waxing. Where are you in the great cycle of your life? For inspiration in figuring it all out, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A woman from New Mexico wrote to tell me that after reading my horoscopes for three years in the Santa Fe Reporter, she had decided to stop. "I changed my beliefs," she said. "I no longer resonate with your philosophy." On the one hand, I was sad that I had lost a reader. On the other hand, I admired her for being able to transform her beliefs, and also for taking practical action to enforce her shift in perspective. That's the kind of purposeful metamorphosis I recommend for you, Aries. What ideas are you ready to shed? What theories no longer explain the nature of life to your satisfaction? Be ruthless in cutting away the thoughts that no longer work for you.



How much do you want to know about your life? How far do you dare to go in your quest for self-mastery? For more insight into your intriguing fate, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In her TED talk, science writer Mary Roach made it clear that human beings don't need genital stimulation to experience orgasms. She spoke of a woman who routinely reaches ecstatic climax by having her eyebrows caressed, and another woman who reaches the big O simply by brushing her teeth. Then there's the woman who can simply think herself into coming, no physical touch necessary. I can't guarantee that a similar aptitude will suddenly turn on in you, Aries, but the coming days could bring you as close as you have ever been. Right now you're a connoisseur of deep pleasure -- a blessed bliss master.

"You know it's Saturday when you are wiping off vodka stains from your face with a marshmallow," testifies the woman who writes the Tumblr blog "French Fries Absinthe Milkshakes." I really hope you don't even come close to having an experience like that this week, Aries. But I'm worried that you will. I sense that you're becoming allergic to caution. You may be subconsciously wishing to shed all decorum and renounce self-control. To be clear, there's nothing inherently wrong with relaxing your guard. I hope you will indeed give up some of your high-stress vigilance and surrender a bit to life's sweet chaos. Just please try to find a playful and safe and not-too-insane way to do so.



Whether it's your time to ferment in the shadows or sing in the sun, fresh power to transform yourself is on the way. Life always delivers the creative energy you need to change into the new thing you must become. For more help in understanding it all, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

On my fifteenth birthday, I finally figured out that eating dairy products was the cause of my chronic respiratory problems. From that day forward, I avoided foods made from cow's milk. My health improved. I kept up this regimen for years. But a month ago, I decided to see if my long-standing taboo still made sense. Just for the fun of it, I gave myself permission to gorge on a tub of organic vanilla yogurt. To my shock, there was no hell to pay. I was free of snot. In the last few weeks, I have feasted regularly on all the creamy goodies I've been missing. I bring this up, Aries, because I suspect an equally momentous shift is possible for you. Some taboo you have honored for a long time, some rule you have obeyed as if it were an axiom, is ripe to be broken.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Actor Casey Affleck appreciates the nurturing power of his loved ones. "My family would be supportive," he says, "if I said I wanted to be a Martian, wear only banana skins, make love to ashtrays, and eat tree bark." I'd like to see you cultivate allies like that in the coming months, Aries. Even if you have never had them before, there's a good chance they will be available. For best results, tinker with your understanding of who your family might be. Redefine what "community" means to you.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Whose enemy are you? Are you anyone's adversary or obstructionist or least favorite person? Answer honestly, please. Don't be in denial. Next question: Do you derive anything useful from playing this oppositional role? If your answer is yes, that's fine. I won't try to talk you out of it. Continue to reap the benefits of being someone's obstacle. But if, on the other hand, you get little value out of this negative relationship, now would be a good time to change it. You have more power than usual to free yourself from being an antagonist.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You can blame it on the coming full moon. You can blame it on the gorgeous storm or the epic dream or the haunting song or the suffering you're struggling to vanquish. All I ask is that you don't blame it on the alcohol. OK? If you're going to do wild and brave and unexpected things, make sure they are rooted in your vigorous response to primal rhythms, not in a drunken surrender to weakness or ignorance. I'm all for you losing your oppressive self-control, but not the healthy kind of self-control.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Deep bronzes and smoky cinnamons and dark chocolates will be your lucky colors in 2014. Mellow mahoganies and resonant russets will work well for you, too. They will all be part of life's conspiracy to get you to slow down, deepen your perspective, and slip into the sweetest groove ever. In this spirit, I urge you to nestle and cuddle and caress more than usual in the coming months. If you aren't totally clear on where home is, either in the external world or inside your heart, devote yourself to finding it. Hone your emotional intelligence. Explore your roots. On a regular basis, remember your reasons for loving life. Stay in close touch with the sources that feed your wild soul.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Edmund Kean (1789-1833) was one of the most famous British actors of his time. But a contemporary, the poet Samuel Coleridge, was frustrated by Kean's inconsistency, regarding him as a great artist who on occasion lapsed into histrionics. "To see him act," said Coleridge, "is like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning." Now and then I get that feeling about you, Aries. You have bursts of brilliance that you sometimes don't follow up on. You're like a superstar who loses your concentration. But I've got a strong feeling that in 2014 you will at least partially overcome this tendency. Your word of power will be consistency.



This week my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES offer you a teaser look at some of the major themes you will be working and playing with in 2014. Start dreaming and scheming about who you're going to be in the new year!
(Beginning December 31, I will devote three consecutive weeks of EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES to an in-depth discussion of your long-range outlook for the coming months. Tune in!)


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Life is best organized as a series of daring ventures from a secure base," wrote psychologist John Bowlby. Some of you Aries enjoy the "daring venture" part of that formula, but neglect the "secure base" aspect. That's why your daring ventures may on occasion go awry. If you are that type of Ram, the first half of 2014 will be an excellent time to correct your bad habit. Life will be offering you considerable help and inspiration in building a strong foundation. And if you already appreciate how important it is for your pursuit of excitement to be rooted in well-crafted stability, the coming months will be golden.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected President of the United States four times, more often than any other president. We can conclude that he was one of the most popular American leaders ever. And yet he never won a majority of the votes cast by the citizens of his home county in New York. I foresee the possibility of a comparable development in your life. You may be more successful working on the big picture than you are in your immediate situation. It could be easier for you to maneuver when you're not dealing with familiar, up-close matters. What's outside your circle might be more attracted to your influence than what's nearer to home.



Would you like further inspiration as you scheme and dream to make the most of life's sometimes puzzling opportunities? Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Sometimes I think too fast and too much. My logic gets sterile. My ideas become jagged and tangled. When this happens, I head off to Turtle Back Hill for a hike through the saltwater marsh. The trail loops around on itself, and I arrive back where I started in about 15 minutes. Sometimes I keep walking, circumambulating four or five times. Going in circles like this seems to help me knit together my fragmented thoughts.  Often, by the time I'm finished, my mind feels unified. I recommend  you find your own version of this ritual, Aries. From what I can tell, you need to get rounder and softer. 



You can learn to be lucky. It's not a mystical force you're born with, but a habit you can develop. How? For starters, be open to new experiences, trust your gut wisdom, expect good fortune, see the bright side of challenging events, and master the art of maximizing serendipitous opportunities. For more help, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Thinking inside the box will be a crime against your nature in the coming weeks. The last place you want to be is in a pigeonhole. I advise you to stay far away from tight squeezes, claustrophobic "sanctuaries," and "convenient" confinements. If you're in a one-size-fits-all situation, you simply won't be able to access your highest intelligence. So then where should you be? I am rooting for you to wander into the wild frontiers where unsanctioned wonders and marvels await you. I'd love for you to find virgin terrain and uncharted territories where the boring old rules don't apply.



How much do you want to know about your life? How far do you dare to go in your quest for self-mastery? For more insight into your intriguing fate, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The poet Charles Baudelaire prayed for help, but not to God -- rather he prayed to the writer Edgar Allan Poe. Novelist Malcolm Lowry sometimes pleaded with God to give him insight, but he also prayed to the writer Franz Kafka. I really like this approach to seeking guidance, and recommend it to you in the coming days. Which hero, dead or alive, could you call on to uplift you? What amazing character might bring you the inspiration you need? Be brazen and imaginative. The spirits could be of more help than you can imagine. Magic is afoot.



What exactly are you looking for? How would you describe the experiences you want more than anything else? It's possible my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE could give you additional help in figuring that out.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

There's something resembling a big red snake slithering around in your mind these days. I don't mean that literally, of course. I'm talking about a big red imaginary snake. But it's still quite potent. While it's not poisonous, neither is it a pure embodiment of sweetness and light. Whether it ends up having a disorienting or benevolent influence on your life all depends on how you handle your relationship with it. I suggest you treat it with respect but also let it know that you're the boss. Give it guidelines and a clear mandate so that it serves your noble ambitions and not your chaotic desires. If you do that, your big red snake will heal and uplift you.



Somewhere there's a treasure that has no value to anyone but you, and a secret that's meaningless to everyone except you, and a frontier that harbors a revelation only you would know how to exploit. Why not go in search of those things? For inspiration, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm not a big fan of fear. It gets far more attention than it deserves. The media and entertainment industries practically worship it, and many of us allow ourselves to be riddled with toxic amounts of the stuff. Having said that, though, I do want to put in a good word for fear. Now and then, it keeps us from doing stupid things. It prods us to be wiser and act with more integrity. It forces us to see the truth when we might prefer to wallow in delusion. Now is one of those times for you, Aries. Thank your fear for helping to wake you up.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Once when I was hiking through Maui's rain forest, I spied a majestic purple honohono flower sprouting from a rotting log. As I bent down close, I inhaled the merged aromas of moldering wood and sweet floral fragrance. Let's make this scene your metaphor of the week, Aries. Here's why: A part of your life that is in the throes of decay can serve as host for a magnificent bloom. What has been lost to you may become the source of fertility. Halloween costume suggestion: a garbage man or cleaning maid wearing a crown of roses.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"I¬ím greedy," says painter David Hockney, "but I¬ím not greedy for money -- I think that can be a burden -- I'm greedy for an exciting life." According to my analysis, Aries, the cosmos is now giving you the go-ahead to cultivate Hockney's style of greed. As you head out in quest of adventure, here's an important piece of advice to keep in mind. Make sure you formulate an intention to seek out thrills that educate and inspire you rather than those that scare you and damage you. It's up to you which kind you attract.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This is an indelicate oracle. If you're offended by the mention of bodily functions in a prophetic context you should STOP READING NOW. Still here? OK. I was walking through my neighborhood when I spied an older woman standing over her aged Yorkshire Terrier next to a bush. The dog was in discomfort, squatting and shivering but unable to relieve himself. "He's having trouble getting his business done," his owner confided in me. "He's been struggling for ten minutes." I felt a rush of sympathy for the distressed creature. With a flourish of my hand, I said, "More power to you, little one. May you purge your burden." The dog instantly defecated. Shrieking her approval, the woman exclaimed, "It's like you waved a magic wand!" Now I am invoking my wizardry in your behalf, Aries, although in a less literal way: More power to you. May you purge your psychological burden.



Do you wish you could get more clarity about the foggy, ambiguous situations you're dealing with? Want more help in exploring the Great Mystery that is your life? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Sometimes you quit games too early, Aries. You run away and dive into a new amusement before you have gotten all the benefits you can out of the old amusement. But I don't think that will be your problem in the coming days. You seem more committed than usual to the ongoing process. You're not going to bolt. That's a good thing. This process is worth your devotion. But I also believe that right now you may need to say no to a small part of it. You've got to be clear that there's something about it you don't like and want to change. If you fail to deal with this doubt now, you might suddenly quit and run away somewhere down the line. Be proactive now and you won't be rash later.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Are you good at haggling? Do you maybe even enjoy the challenge of negotiating for a better price, of angling for a fairer deal? The coming week will be a favorable time to make extensive use of this skill. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you will thrive on having friendly arguments with just about everyone, from your buddies to your significant other to your mommy to God Herself. Everywhere you go, I encourage you to engage in lively discussions as you hammer out compromises that will serve you well. Be cheerful and adaptable and forceful.



Take inventory of the extent that "No" dominates your life. Notice how often you say or think: 1. "That's not right." 2. "I don't like that." 3. "I don't agree with that." 4. "They don't like me." 5. "I'm not very good." 6. "That should be different from what it is." For help in retraining yourself to say "Yes!" at least 51% of the time, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I've got a good feeling about your relationship with intimacy in the coming weeks. Judging from the astrological omens, I think you will have a good instinct about how to drum up interesting fun with your most important allies. You'll just naturally know what to do to make your collaborative efforts synergistic. So by all means cash in on this potential. Don't just sit back and hope for the best; rather, call on your imagination to provide you with original ideas about how to make it all happen.

"If Taylor Swift is going to have six breakups a year," observed comedian Bill Maher, "she needs to write a new song entitled 'Maybe It's Me.'" He was referring to Swift's habit of using her romantic misadventures to stimulate her lyric-writing creativity. With that as your prompt, Aries, I'll ask you to do some soul-searching about your own intimacy issues. How have you contributed to the problems you've had in getting the love and care you want? What unconscious behavior or conditioned responses have undermined your romantic satisfaction, and what could you do to transform them? The next eight weeks will be prime time to revolutionize your approach to relationships.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"A good story should make you laugh, and a moment later break your heart," wrote Chuck Palahniuk in his book Stranger Than Fiction. From what I can tell, Aries, the sequence is the reverse for you. In your story, the disruption has already happened. Next comes the part where you laugh. It may be a sardonic chuckle at first, as you become aware of the illusions you had been under before the jolt exposed them. Eventually I expect you will be giggling and gleeful, eternally grateful for the tricky luck that freed you to pursue a more complete version of your fondest dream.



How's your fight for freedom going? Are you making progress in liberating yourself from your unconscious obsessions, bad habits, and conditioned responses? For assistance and inspiration, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"No regrets? Really?" asks author Richard Power. "I have regrets. They are sacred to me. They inform my character. They bear witness to my evolution. Glimpses of lost love and treasure are held inside of them; like small beautiful creatures suspended in amber." I think you can see where this horoscope is going, Aries. I'm going to suggest you do what Powers advises: "Do not avoid your regrets. Embrace them. Listen to their stories. Hold them to your heart when you want to remember the price you paid to become who you truly are." (Find more by Richard Power.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You seem primed to act like a ram, the astrological creature associated with your sign. I swear you have that look in your eyes: the steely gaze that tells me you're about to take a very direct approach to smashing the obstacles in your way. I confess that I have not always approved of such behavior. In the past, you have sometimes done more damage to yourself than to the obstruction you're trying to remove. But this is one time when the head-first approach might work. There is indeed evidence that the job at hand requires a battering ram. What does your intuition tell you?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

An Indian student named Sankalp Sinha has invented the "Good Morning Sing N Shock." It's an alarm clock that plays you a song and gives you a small electrical jolt when you hit the snooze button. The voltage applied is far less intense than, say, a taser, and is designed to energize you rather than disable you. I encourage you to seek out wake-up calls like the kind this device administers, Aries: fairly gentle, yet sufficiently dramatic to get your attention. The alternative would be to wait around for blind fate to provide the wake-up calls. They might be a bit more strenuous.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

If you google the statement "I can change overnight," most of the results that come up are negative, like "It's not something I can change overnight" or "I don't think I can change overnight." But there's one google link to "I can change overnight." It's a declaration made by Taurus painter Willem de Kooning. He was referring to how unattached he was to defining his work and how easy it was for him to mutate his artistic style. I wouldn't normally advise you Tauruses to use "I can change overnight" as your battle cry. But for the foreseeable future you do have the power to make some rather rapid and thorough transformations.

YOU NEED MYSTERY. Factual information and reasonable thinking alone are not sufficient to guide you through life¬ís labyrinthine tests. You need and deserve regular deliveries of uncanny revelation.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"The artist is by necessity a collector," said graphic designer Paul Rand. "He accumulates things with the same ardor and curiosity with which a boy stuffs his pockets. He borrows from the sea and from the scrap heap; he takes snapshots, makes mental notes, and records impressions on tablecloths and newspapers. He has a taste for children's wall scrawling as appreciative as that for prehistoric cave painting." Whether or not you're an artist, Gemini, this would be an excellent approach for you in the coming days. You're in a phase when  you can thrive by being a gatherer of everything that attracts and fascinates you. You don't need to know yet why you're assembling all these clues. That will be revealed in good time.

YOU NEED MAGIC. Every day, you have to wade through a relentless surge of soul-less information. The experience tends to shut down your sense of wonder. 


Every day, you're over-exposed to narratives that have been sucked free of delight and mystery. That's why you have to make strenuous efforts to keep your world enchanted.


I aspire to contribute to the sacred cause of feeding your sense of wonder and enchantment. That's one of my main motivations for offering you my free horoscopes, book excerpts, and music.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Can you remember the last time you bumped up against a limitation caused by your lack of knowledge? What did it feel like? I expect that sometime soon you will have that experience again. You may shiver with worry as you contemplate the potential consequences of your continued ignorance. But you may also feel the thrill of hungry curiosity rising up in you. If all goes well, the fear and curiosity will motivate you to get further educated. You will set to work on a practical plan to make it happen.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"My story isn¬ít sweet and harmonious like invented stories," wrote novelist Herman Hesse. "It tastes of folly and bewilderment, of madness and dream, like the life of all people who no longer want to lie to themselves." As interesting as Hesse's declaration is, let's not take it as gospel. Let's instead envision the possibility that when people reduce the number of lies they tell themselves, their lives may become sweeter and more harmonious as a result. I propose that exact scenario for you right now, Leo. There might be a rough adjustment period as you cut back on your self-deceptions, but eventually your folly and bewilderment will diminish as the sweet harmony grows.

YOU'RE STRONGER THAN YOU KNOW. Whether it's your time to ferment in the shadows or sing in the sun, fresh power to transform yourself is on the way. Life always delivers the creative energy you need to change into the new thing you must become.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Novelist James Joyce once articulated an extreme wish that other writers have probably felt but never actually said. "The demand that I make of my reader," said Joyce, "is that he should devote his whole life to reading my works." Was he being mischievous? Maybe. But he never apologized or issued a retraction. Your assignment, Virgo, is to conjure up your own version of that wild desire: a clear statement of exactly what you really, really want in all of its extravagant glory. I think it'll be healthy for you to identify this pure and naked longing. (P.S. I'm not implying that you should immediately try to get it fulfilled, though. For now, the important thing is knowing what it is.)

YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO AND YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Now and then a British Libra named Lloyd Scott dresses up in funny costumes while competing in long-distance races. He does it to raise money for charity. In the 2011 London Marathon, he wore a nine-foot snail outfit for the duration of the course. It took him 27 days to finish. I suggest you draw inspiration from his heroic effort. From a cosmic perspective, it would make sense for you to take your time as you engage in amusing activities that benefit your fellow humans.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

What will you do now that you have acquired more clout and visibility? Will you mostly just pump up your self-love and bask in the increased attention? There's nothing wrong with that, of course. But if those are the only ways you cash in on your added power, the power won't last. I suggest you take advantage of your enhanced influence by engaging in radical acts of magnanimity. Perform good deeds and spread big ideas. The more blessings you bestow on your fellow humans, the more enduring your new perks will be.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You've been pretty wild and uncontained lately, and that's OK. I've loved seeing how much permission you've given yourself to ramble free, experiment with the improbable, and risk being a fool. I suspect that history will judge a majority of your recent explorations as tonic. But now, Sagittarius, the tenor of the time is shifting. To continue being in alignment with your highest good, I believe you will have to rein in your wanderlust and start attending to the care and cultivation of your power spot. Can you find a way to enjoy taking on more responsibility?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"The person who can't visualize a horse galloping on a tomato is an idiot," said the founder of Surrealism, writer Andr√© Breton. I wouldn't go so far as to call such an imagination-deprived soul an "idiot," but I do agree with the gist of his declaration. One of the essential facets of intelligence is the ability to conjure up vivid and creative images in one's mind. When daily life has grown a bit staid or stuck or overly serious, this skill becomes even more crucial. Now is one of those times for you, Capricorn. If you have any trouble visualizing a horse galloping on a tomato, take measures to boost the fertility of your imagination.

"I want to be with those who know the secret things, or else alone," wrote the eccentric ecstatic poet Rainer Maria Rilke. That wouldn't be a good rule for you Aquarians to live by all the time. To thrive, you need a variety of cohorts and allies, including those who know and care little about secret things. But I suspect that for the next few weeks, an affinity for those who know secret things might suit you well. More than that, they may be exactly the accomplices who will help you attend to your number one assignment: exploratory holy work in the depths.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

To launch your horoscope, I'll steal a line from a Thomas Pynchon novel: A revelation trembles just beyond the threshold of your understanding. To continue your oracle, I'll borrow a message I heard in my dream last night: A breakthrough shivers just beyond the edge of your courage. Next, I'll use words I think I heard while eavesdropping on a conversation at Whole Foods: If you want to cook up the ultimate love feast, you're still missing one ingredient. And to finish this oracle, Pisces, I'll say that if you want to precipitate the trembling revelation, activate the shivering breakthrough, and acquire the missing ingredient, imitate what I've done in creating this horoscope. Assume the whole world is offering you useful clues, and listen closely.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Normally, International CAPS LOCK DAY happens only once a year, on June 28. But in alignment with your current astrological omens, you have been granted the right to observe the next seven days as your own personal International CAPS LOCK DAYS. That means you will probably be forgiven and tolerated if use OVERHEATED ORATORY and leap to THUNDEROUS CONCLUSIONS and engage in MELODRAMATIC GESTURES. You may even be thanked -- although it's important to note that the gratitude you receive may only come later, AFTER THE DUST HAS SETTLED.



Assume that your drive to experience pleasure isn't a barrier to your spiritual growth, but is in fact essential to it. Proceed on the hypothesis that cultivating joy can make you a more ethical and compassionate person. Imagine that feeling good has something important to teach you every day. For inspiration in practicing this approach, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestation of your own blessings," says author Elizabeth Gilbert. I recommend that you experiment with this subversive idea, Aries. Just for a week, see what happens if you devote yourself to making yourself feel really good. I mean risk going to extremes as you pursue happiness with focused zeal. Try this: Draw up a list of experiences that you know will give you intense pleasure, and indulge in them all without apology. And please don't fret about the possible consequences of getting crazed with joy. Be assured that the cosmos is providing you with more slack than usual. 



What fresh blessings will life bring you? What questions should you be asking? To explore the ripening trends further, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To add zest to mealtime, you might choose food that has been seasoned with red chili peppers, cumin, or other piquant flavors. Some chimpanzees have a similar inclination, which is why they like to snack on red fire ants. Judging from the astrological omens, I'm guessing you are currently in a phase when your attraction to spicy things is at a peak -- not just for dinner but in other areas of your life, as well. I have a suggestion: Pursue rowdy fun with adventures that have metaphorical resemblances to red chili peppers, but stay away from those that are like red fire ants.

"I have tried in my way to be free," sings Leonard Cohen in his song "Bird on a Wire." In other words, he has done the best he can to liberate himself from his unconscious patterns, bad habits, and self-delusions. He hasn't been perfect in his efforts, but the work he has done has earned him a measure of deliverance from his suffering. I recommend you follow his lead, Aries. Do your best to bring more relief and release into your life. Get rid of things that hold you back. Overthrow a pinched expectation and ignore a so-called limitation or two. By this time next week, I hope you will be able to say sincerely, "I have tried in my way to be free."

The 19th-century Italian composer Gioachino Rossini was a prolific creator who produced 39 operas. Renowned for his lyrical melodies, he was sometimes referred to as the "Italian Mozart." So confident was he in his abilities that he bragged he could set a laundry list to music. I trust you will have comparable aplomb in the coming weeks, Aries, since you will be asked to do the equivalent of composing an opera using a laundry list for inspiration. This will be a different challenge than making lemonade out of lemons, but it could be even more fun and interesting.

The Space Needle is a tourist attraction in Seattle. It's taller than the Washington Monument but shorter than the Eiffel Tower. Near the top of the structure is a circular restaurant that rotates slowly, making one complete turn every 47 minutes. The motor that moves this 125-ton mass is small: only 1.5 horsepower. In the coming days, Aries, I foresee you having a metaphorically similar ability. You will be able to wield a great deal of force with a seemingly small and compact "engine."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In his book The Fisher King and the Handless Maiden, Robert Johnson says many of us are as much in debt with our psychic energy as we are with our financial life. We work too hard. We rarely refresh ourselves with silence and slowness and peace. We don't get enough sleep or good food or exposure to nature. And so we're routinely using up more of our reserves than we are able to replenish. We're chronically running a deficit. "It is genius to store energy," says Johnson. He recommends creating a plan to save it up so that you always have more than enough to draw on when an unexpected opportunity arrives. The coming weeks will be an excellent time to make this a habit, Aries.

Play the game called "Tell me the story of your scars." It's best to do it with a skilled empath who is curious about your fate's riddles and skilled at helping you find redemption in your wounds.


"How did you get that blotch on your knee?" he or she might begin, and you describe the time in childhood when you fell on the sidewalk. Then maybe he or she would say, "Why do you always look so sad when you hear that song?" And you'd narrate the tale of how it was playing when an old lover broke your heart. The questions and answers continue until you unveil the history of your hurts, both physical and psychic. Treat yourself to this game soon.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"To know when to stop is of the same importance as to know when to begin," said the painter Paul Klee. Take that to heart, Aries! You are pretty adept at getting things launched, but you've got more to learn about the art of stopping. Sometimes you finish prematurely. Other times you sort of disappear without officially bringing things to a close. Now would be an excellent time to refine your skills.

"The problem with quotes on the Internet is that it's hard to determine whether or not they are genuine." So said Joan of Arc back in 1429, right before she helped lead French troops in the battle of Patay. JUST KIDDING! Joan of Arc never had the pleasure of surfing the Web, of course, since it didn't exist until long after she died. But I was trying to make a point that will be useful for you to keep in mind, Taurus, which is: Be skeptical of both wild claims and mild claims.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

French Impressionist painter Claude Monet loved to paint water lilies, and he did so over and over again for many years. Eventually he created about 250 canvases that portrayed these floating flowers. Should we conclude that he repeated himself too much? Should we declare that he was boringly repetitive? Or might we wonder if he kept finding new delights in his comfortable subject? Would we have enough patience to notice that each of the 250 paintings shows the water lilies in a different kind of light, depending on the weather and the season and the time of day? I vote for the latter view, and suggest that you adopt a similar approach to the familiar things in your life during the coming weeks.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"In order to swim one takes off all one's clothes," said 19th-century Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard. "In order to aspire to the truth one must undress in a far more inward sense, divest oneself of all one's inward clothes, of thoughts, conceptions, selfishness, etc., before one is sufficiently naked." Your assignment in the coming week, Cancerian, is to get au naturel like that. It's time for you to make yourself available for as much of the raw, pure, wild truth as you can stand.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Gertrude Stein was an innovative writer. Many illustrious artists were her friends. But she had an overly elevated conception of her own worth. "Think of the Bible and Homer," she said, "think of Shakespeare and think of me." On another occasion, she proclaimed, "Einstein was the creative philosophic mind of the century, and I have been the creative literary mind of the century." Do you know anyone like Stein, Leo? Here's the truth, in my opinion: To some degree, we are all like Stein. Every one of us has at least one inflated idea about ourselves -- a conceited self-conception that doesn't match reality. It was my turn to confront my egotistical delusions a few weeks ago. Now would be an excellent time for you to deal with yours. Don't be too hard on yourself, though. Just recognize the inflation, laugh about it, and move on.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

When I close my eyes, I get a psychic vision of you as a kid playing outside on a warm summer day. You're with friends, immersed in a game that commands your full attention. Suddenly, you hear a jingling tune wafting your way from a distance. It's the ice cream truck. You stop what you're doing and run inside your home to beg your mom for some money. A few minutes later, you're in a state of bliss, communing with your Fudgsicle or ice cream cone or strawberry-lime fruit bar. I have a feeling that you will soon experience an adult version of this scene, Virgo. Metaphorically speaking, either the ice cream man or the ice cream woman will be coming to your neighborhood.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

During the past ten months, you have been unusually adventurous. The last time you summoned so much courage and expansiveness may have been 2001. I'm impressed! Please accept my respect and appreciation. You've had a sixth sense about knowing when it's wise to push beyond your limitations and boundaries. You have also had a seventh sense about intuiting when to be crafty and cautious as you wander through the frontiers. Now here's one of your assignments for the next 12 months: Distill all you've learned out there in the borderlands and decide how you will use your wisdom to build an unshakable power spot back here in the heart of the action.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Michael Faraday (1791-1867) was one of the most influential scientists in history. He produced major breakthroughs in both chemistry and physics. Have you ever used devices that run on electricity? You can thank him for playing a major role in developing that wonderful convenience. And yet unlike most scientists, he had only the most elementary grasp of mathematics. In fact, his formal education was negligible. I propose that we name him your role model of the week. He's a striking example of the fact that you can arrive at your chosen goal by many different paths. Keep that in mind if you're ever tempted to believe that there's just one right way to fulfill your dreams.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"The only thing that we learn from history," said the German philosopher Georg Hegel, "is that we never learn anything from history." I'm urging you to refute that statement in the coming weeks, Sagittarius. I'm pleading with you to search your memory for every possible clue that might help you be brilliant in dealing with your immediate future. What have you done in the past that you shouldn't do now? What haven't you done in the past that you should do now?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

According to my analysis of the astrological omens, now would be a pretty good time to talk about things that are hard to talk about. I don't necessarily mean that you'll find it easy to do. But I suspect it would be relatively free of pain and karmic repercussions. There may even be a touch of pleasure once the catharsis kicks in. So try it if you dare, Capricorn. Summon the courage to express truths that have previously been hard to pin down. Articulate feelings that have been murky or hidden. For best results, encourage those you trust to do the same.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Are you familiar with Quidditch? It's a rough sport played by wizards in the fictional world of Harry Potter. All seven books in the series mention it, so it's an important element. Author J.K. Rowling says she dreamed up the sport after having a quarrel with her boyfriend. "In my deepest, darkest soul," she reports, "I would quite like to see him hit by a bludger." (In Quidditch, a bludger is a big black ball made of iron.) I bring this up, Aquarius, because I suspect that you, too, are in position to use anger in a creative and constructive way. Take advantage of your raw emotion to make a lasting improvement in your life.

In his erotic poem "Your Sex," Joe Bolton exults: "My heart simplified, I touch the bud of happiness -- it's in season. And whatever grief I might have felt before simply dies inside me." You might want to write that down on a slip of paper and carry it around with you this week, Pisces. According to my understanding of the astrological omens, the bud of happiness is now in season for you. You have good reason to shed the undertones of sadness and fear you carry around with you. I'll tell you the last lines of Bolton's poem, because they also apply: "Sometimes I think it¬ís best just to take pleasure wherever we want and can. Look: the twilight is alive with wild honey." (The full poem.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Maybe you've seen that meme circulating on the Internet: "My desire to be well-informed is at odds with my desire to remain sane." If you feel that way now -- and I suspect you might soon if you don't already -- you have cosmic permission, at least for a while, to emphasize sanity over being well-informed. Lose track of what Kim Jong-un and Kim Kardashian are up to, ignore the statements of every jerk on the planet, and maybe even go AWOL from the flood of data that relentlessly pours toward you. Instead, pay attention to every little thing your body has to tell you. Remember and marvel at your nightly dreams. Go slow. Lay low. Be soft. Have fun with unspectacular influences that make you feel at home in the world.



Listen to my IN-DEPTH, LONG-TERM AUDIO FORECAST for your life in the coming months. Normally my Expanded Audio Horoscopes cover the immediate future. But this week, I'm reporting on the themes that I think will be important for you during the second half of 2013 and beyond.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

I expect you will be called on to move fluidly between opposing camps or competing interests or different realities. Maybe you'll volunteer to serve as an arbiter between the crabby good guys and the righteous bad guys. Perhaps you'll try to decode one friend's quirky behavior so that another friend can understand it. You might have to interpret my horoscopes for people who think astrology is bunk. You may even have to be a mediator between your own heart and head, or explain the motivations of your past self to your future self. You can't be perfect, of course. There will be details lost in translation. But if you're as patient as a saint and as tricky as a crow, you'll succeed.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Pablo Casals was one of the greatest cello players who ever lived. Among his early inspirations was the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Casals discovered Bach's six cello suites when he was 13 years old, and played them every day for the next 13 years. Have you ever done something similar, Gemini? Devoted yourself to a pleasurable discipline on a regular basis for a long time? I invite you to try it. The coming months will be an excellent time to seek mastery through a diligent attention to the details.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"I know that I am not a category," said philosopher Buckminster Fuller. "I am not a thing -- a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process." Philosopher Norman O. Brown had a similar experience. "The human body is not a thing or substance, but a continuous creation," he mused. "It is an energy system which is never a complete structure; never static; is in perpetual inner self-construction and self-destruction." Now is an excellent time to imagine yourself in these terms, Cancerian. You're not a finished product, and never will be! Celebrate your fluidity, your changeableness, your instinctual urge to reinvent yourself.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Renowned 20th-century theologian Karl Barth worked on his book Church Dogmatics for 36 years. It was more than 9,000 pages long and contained over six million words. And yet it was incomplete. He had more to say, and wanted to keep going. What's your biggest undone project, Leo? The coming months will be a good time to concentrate on bringing it to a climax. Ideally, you will do so with a flourish, embracing the challenge of creating an artful ending with the same liveliness you had at the beginning of the process. But even if you have to culminate your work in a plodding, prosaic way, do it! Your next big project will be revealed within weeks after you've tied up the last loose end.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Susannah Cibber was a popular 18th-century English contralto whose singing was expressive and moving. On one occasion, she performed Handel's Messiah with such verve that an influential priest responded by making an extravagant guarantee. He told her that as a result of her glorious singing, any sins she had committed or would commit were forever forgiven. I'd like to see you perpetrate an equivalent amazement, Virgo: a good or beautiful or soulful deed that wins you a flood of enduring slack. The cosmic omens suggest that such an achievement is quite possible.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Johnny Appleseed was a 19th-century folk hero renowned for planting apple trees in vast areas of rural America. During the 70 years this famous Libra was alive, he never got married. He believed that if he remained unwed during his time on earth, he would be blessed with two spirit-wives in the after-life. Have you ever done something like that yourself, Libra? Is there an adventure you've denied yourself in the here and now because you think that's the only way you can get some bigger, better adventure at a later date? If so, now would be an excellent time to adjust your attitude.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"It is kind of fun to do the impossible," said Walt Disney, a pioneer animator whose cartoon innovations were remarkable. Judging from your current astrological omens, I think you Scorpios have every right to adopt his battle cry as your mantra. You've got an appointment with the frontier. You're primed to perform experiments at the edge of your understanding. Great mysteries will be tempting you to come closer and lost secrets will be teasing you with juicy clues. As you explore and tinker with the unknown, you might also want to meditate on the graffiti I saw scrawled on a mirror in a public restroom: "Only those who attempt the absurd can achieve the impossible."

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Astronauts on lunar expeditions have orbited the moon and seen its entire surface. But the rest of us have never seen more than 59 percent of it. As the moon revolves around the Earth, it always keeps one side turned away from our view. Isn't that amazing and eerie? The second most important heavenly body, which is such a constant and intimate factor in our lives, is half-hidden. I'd like to propose that there is an analogous phenomenon in your inner world, Sagittarius: a part of you that forever conceals some of its true nature. But I'm pretty sure you will soon be offered an unprecedented chance to explore that mysterious realm.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Anglo-Irish novelist Laurence Sterne married his wife Elizabeth in 1741. Twenty-five years later he fell in love with another woman, Eliza. In composing love letters to his new infatuation, he lifted some of the same romantic passages he had originally written to Elizabeth when he was courting her. Try hard not to do anything remotely resembling that, Capricorn. Give your intimate allies your freshest stuff. Treat them as the unique creatures they are. Resist the temptation to use shticks that worked to create closeness in the past.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

It's important that you not punish yourself or allow yourself to be punished for the sins that other people have committed. It's also crucial that you not think nasty thoughts about yourself or put yourself in the presence of anyone who's prone to thinking nasty thoughts about you. Self-doubt and self-criticism may be healthy for you to entertain about ten days from now, and at that time you will probably benefit from receiving compassionate critique from others, too. But for the moment, please put the emphasis on self-protection and self-nurturing.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

For over three decades, a man in Assam, India has worked to build a forest. When Jadav "Molai" Payeng started planting and tending seeds at the age of 16, the sandbars bordering the Brahmaputra River were barren. Today, almost entirely thanks to him, they're covered with a 1,360-acre forest that harbors deer, birds, tigers, rhinos, and elephants. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you could launch a comparable project in the next 12 months, Pisces -- a labor of love that will require your persistent creativity and provide you with sanctuary for a long time.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Irish poet Richard Brinsley Sheridan didn't confine his lyrical wit to well-crafted poems on the printed page. He used it to say things that would advance his practical ambitions. For example, when he first met the woman who would eventually become his wife, he said to her, "Why don't you come into my garden? I would like my roses to see you." That's the kind of persuasive power I hope you will summon in the coming days, Aries. According to my analysis of the omens, you should have it in abundance. So what's the best use of this mojo? Is there anything you would really like to sell? What new resources do you want to bring into your sphere? Who do you want to convince?



"Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show." So begins Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield. I'd like to inspire you to write a story of your own that begins like that. For help, tune into your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The longest natural arch in the world is the Fairy Bridge in Guangxi Province, China. Made of limestone, this 400-foot-wide span crosses over the Buliu River. No one outside of China knew about it until 2009, when an American explorer spied it on Google Earth. Let's make the Fairy Bridge your metaphor of the month, Aries. Judging by the astrological omens, I suspect there's a good chance you will soon find something like a natural, previously hidden bridge. In other words, be alert for a link between things you didn't know were connected.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Back in the 1920s, the governor of Texas was determined to forbid the teaching of foreign languages in public schools. To bolster her case, she called on the Bible. "If English was good enough for Jesus Christ," she said, "it's good enough for us." She was dead serious. I suspect you may soon have to deal with that kind of garbled thinking, Aries. And it may be impossible to simply ignore it, since the people wielding it may have some influence on your life. So what's the best way to deal with it? Here's what I advise: Be amused. Quell your rage. Stay calm. And methodically gather the cool, clear evidence about what is really true.

"I'm still learning," said Michelangelo when he was 87 years old. For now, he's your patron saint. With his unflagging curiosity as your inspiration, maybe your hunger for new teachings will bloom. You will register the fact that you don't already know everything there is to know . . . you have not yet acquired all the skills you were born to master . . . you're still in the early stages of exploring whole swaths of experience that will be important to you as you become the person you want to be. Even if you're not enrolled in a formal school, it's time to take your education to the next level.



I invite you to keep a running list of all the ways life delights you and helps you and energizes you. Describe everyday miracles you take for granted . . . the uncanny powers you possess . . . the small joys that occur so routinely you forget how much they mean to you . . . the steady flow of benefits bestowed on you by people you know and don't know. What works for you? What makes you feel at home in the world? For inspiration in this noble effort, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the alternate universe created by Marvel comic books, there is a mutant superhero called Squirrel Girl. She has the magic power to summon hordes of cute, furry squirrels. Under her guidance, they swarm all over the bad guy she's battling and disable him with their thousands of tiny chomps and thrashing tails. She and her rodent allies have defeated such arch-villains as Dr. Doom, Deadpool, Baron Mordo, and Ego the Living Planet. Let's make her your role model for the coming weeks, Aries. The cumulative force of many small things will be the key to your victories. As in Squirrel Girl's case, your adversaries' overconfidence may also be a factor.

The Tarahumara Indians of northwestern Mexico are renowned for their ability to run long distances. The best runners can cover 200 miles in two days. The paths they travel are not paved or smooth, either, but rather the rough canyon trails that stretch between their settlements. Let's make them your inspirational role models in the coming week, Aries. I'm hoping that you will be as tough and tenacious as they are -- that you will pace yourself for the long haul, calling on your instinctual strength to guide you. 



No one knows you better than you do, but maybe I can help you dig up even more self-knowledge. Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Are you afraid that you lack a crucial skill or aptitude? Do you have a goal that you're worried might be impossible to achieve because of this inadequacy? If so, now is a good time to make plans to fill in the gap. If you formulate such an intention, you will attract a benevolent push from the cosmos. Why spend another minute fretting about the consequences of your ignorance when you have more power than usual to correct that ignorance?



All of creation loves you very much. Even now, people you know and people you don't know are collaborating to make sure you have all you need to make your next smart move. But are you willing to start loving life back with an equal intensity? The adoration it offers you has not exactly been unrequited, but there is room for you to be more demonstrative. For help in cultivating this approach, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

How we react to the sound of the wind gives clues to our temperament, said philosopher Theodor W. Adorno. The unhappy person thinks of "the fragility of his house and suffers from shallow sleep and violent dreams." But for the happy person, the wind sings "the song of protectedness: its furious howling concedes that it has power over him no longer." I bring this up to illustrate a point about your life. There will be a strong and vivid influence coming your way that is like the wind as described by Adorno. It's neither bad nor good in itself, but may seem like one or the other depending on the state of mind you choose to cultivate.



How are you going to change what needs to be changed and accept what needs to be accepted? To get some support from me, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The writer Oliver Burkeman has some advice that would be helpful for you Aries folks to hear right now: "When you assume your current preferences won't alter, you'll make bad decisions: embarking on a career or marriage, say, not with a view to its durability, but solely based on how it makes you feel now." I am most definitely not predicting that you are about to make the kind of bad decision Burkeman refers to. I'm sure my warning here in this horoscope will derail any temptation you might have to make short-sighted moves.



Wouldn't you love to learn more about who you really are? What better adventure is there than learning about your soul's code? For more hints, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

German theologian Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a central figure in the rebellion against the Catholic Church that led to the Protestant Reformation. You'll never guess where he was when he was struck by the epiphany that became the core axiom of his new religion. I'll tell you: He was sitting on the toilet in the Wittenberg Monastery. The Holy Spirit gave him the crucial knowledge then and there, or so he testified. In this spirit, Aries, keep a very open mind about where you will be and what you will be doing when your illuminations arrive this week. 



What is the obvious secret you can't quite see? How could you turn your challenges into daily gifts for yourself? For clues to mysteries like these, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Art cannot be modern," said Austrian painter Egon Schiele. "Art is primordially eternal." I love that idea. Not all of the artifacts called "art" fit that scrupulous definition, of course. Katy Perry's music and the film Wreck It Ralph may have some entertainment value, but they're not primordially eternal. I bring this up, Aries, because I think you have entered a particularly wild and timeless phase of your own development. Whether or not you are literally an artist, you have a mandate to create your life story as a primordially eternal work of art.



Sometimes it's a challenge to try to figure out what's important and what's not important. If you'd like more of my input, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I was too lazy to write your horoscope this week, so I went to a website that hawks bumper stickers and copied a few of their slogans to use as your "advice." Here you go. 1. Never follow a rule off a cliff. 2. Have the courage to honor your peculiarities. 3. It's never too late to have a rebellious adolescence. 4. Criticize by creating. 5. Never make anything simple and efficient when it can be elaborate and wonderful. 6. Complex problems have simple, easy-to-understand, morally clear, wrong answers. APRIL FOOL! I lied. I wasn't lazy at all. I worked hard to ensure that all the suggestions I just provided are in strict accordance with the astrological gestalt.



I hope the oracle above provides you with the inspiration you need to do what you've got to do and change what needs to be changed. But if you need more clues, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE, where I go further in exploring your mysteries.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Nourish beginnings, let us nourish beginnings," says poet Muriel Rukeyser in her poem "Elegy in Joy." "Not all things are blest," she continues, "but the seeds of all things are blest. The blessing is in the seed." I urge you to adopt this perspective in the coming weeks, Aries. Be extra sweet and tender and reverent toward anything that is just sprouting, toward anything that is awakening, toward anything that invokes the sacredness of right now. "This moment," sings Rukeyser, "this seed, this wave of the sea, this look, this instant of love."



Grace emerges in the ebb and flow, not just the flow. The waning reveals a different blessing than the waxing. Where are you in the great cycle of your life? For inspiration in figuring it all out, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid." That could turn out to be a useful mantra for you in the coming week. Being pragmatic should be near the top of your priority list, whereas being judgmental should be at the bottom. Here's another mantra that may serve you well: "Those who take history personally are condemned to repeat it." I hope you invoke that wisdom to help you escape an oppressive part of your past. Do you have room for one more inspirational motto, Aries? Here it is: "I am only as strong as my weakest delusion."



How well is your imagination working these days? Could it use a boost? A prod? A jolt of inspiration? Try tuning in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Maybe you're not literally in exile. You haven't been forced to abandon your home and you haven't been driven from your power spot against your will. But you may nevertheless be feeling banished or displaced. It could be due to one of the conditions that storyteller Michael Meade names: "We may experience exile as a lack of recognition, a period of transition, an identity crisis, a place of stuckness, or else having a gift and no place to give it." Do any of those describe your current predicament, Aries? The good news, Meade says, is that exile can shock you awake to the truth about where you belong. It can rouse your irrepressible motivation to get back to your rightful place.

In 1993, Frenchman Emile Leray was on a solo trip through the Sahara Desert. In the middle of nowhere, his car suffered a major breakdown. It was unfixable. But he didn't panic. Instead, he used a few basic tools he had on hand to dismantle the vehicle and convert its parts into a makeshift motorcycle. He was able to ride it back to civilization. I foresee the possibility of a metaphorically similar development in your future, Aries. You will get the opportunity to be very resourceful as you turn an apparent setback into a successful twist of fate.



Whether it's your time to ferment in the shadows or sing in the sun, fresh power to transform yourself is on the way. Life always delivers the creative energy you need to change into the new thing you must become. For more help in understanding it all, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the course of her world travels, writer Jane Brunette has seen many wonderful things -- as well as a lot of trash. The most beautiful litter, she says, is in Bali. She loves the "woven palm leaf offerings, colorful cloth left from a ceremony, and flowers that dry into exquisite wrinkles of color." Even the shiny candy wrappers strewn by the side of the road are fun to behold. Your assignment, Aries, is to adopt a perceptual filter akin to Brunette's. Is there any stuff other people regard as worthless or outworn that you might find useful, interesting, or even charming? I'm speaking metaphorically as well as literally.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Afrikaner author Laurens van der Post told a story about a conversation between psychologist Carl Jung and Ochwiay Biano, a Pueblo Indian chief. Jung asked Biano to offer his views about white people. "White people must be crazy because they think with their heads," said the chief, "and it is well-known that only crazy people do that." Jung asked him what the alternative was. Biano said that his people think with their hearts. That's your assignment for the week ahead, Aries: to think with your heart -- especially when it comes to love. For extra credit, you should feel with your head -- especially when it comes to love. Happy Valentine Daze, Aries!

"What we need is more people who specialize in the impossible," said poet Theodore Roethke. For the foreseeable future, Aries, you could and should be a person like that. I'm not saying that you will forevermore be a connoisseur of amazements and a massager of miracles and a magnet for unexpected beauty. But if you want to, you can play those roles for the next few weeks. How many exotic explorations and unlikely discoveries can you cram into your life between now and March 1? How many unimaginable transformations can you imagine?

Aries (March 21-April 19)
Wageni ni baraka is a Swahili proverb that means "guests are a blessing." That's not always true, of course. Sometimes guests can be a boring inconvenience or a messy burden. But for you in the coming weeks, Aries, I'm guessing the proverb will be 98 percent correct. The souls who come calling are likely to bestow unusually fine benefits. They may provide useful clues or missing links you've been searching for. They might inspire you to see things about yourself that you really need to know, and they might even give you shiny new playthings. Open your mind and heart to the unexpected blessings.

The German government sponsored a scientific study of dowsing, which is a form of magical divination used to locate underground sources of water. After ten years, the chief researcher testified, "It absolutely works, beyond all doubt. But we have no idea why or how." An assertion like that might also apply to the mojo you'll have at your disposal, Aries, as you forge new alliances and bolster your web of connections in the coming weeks. I don't know how or why you'll be such an effective networker, but you will be.

"If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it," wrote nineteenth-century poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. "Every arrow that flies feels the attraction of the earth." This is good counsel for you to keep in mind during the coming weeks, Aries. I suspect you will have a good, clear shot at a target you've been trying to get close to for a long time. Make sure you adjust your trajectory to account for the attraction of the earth.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Writing at io9.com, Charlie Jane Anders provides "10 Signs You Could Be the Chosen Savior." Among the clues are the following: 1. "How often does someone comes up to you on the street, point at you, gibber something inarticulate, and run away?" 2. "How many robot/clone duplicates of yourself have you come across?" 3. "Is there a blurry black-and-white photo or drawing from history that sort of looks like you?" 4. "Have you achieved weird feats that nobody could explain, but which nobody else witnessed?" Now would be a good time for you to take this test, Aries. You're in a phase of your astrological cycle when your dormant superpowers may finally be awakening -- a time when you might need to finally claim a role you've previously been unready for. (Read Anders' article.)



Are you ready to shed your superstitious fears about the future? Would you like to slip into 2013 armed with an influx of confidence and poise? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in!

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Dear Rob the Astrologer: I have a big question for you. If I could get access to a time machine, where would you suggest I should go? Is there a way to calculate the time and place where I could enjoy favorable astrological connections that would bring out the best in me? -Curious Taurus." Dear Curious: Here are some locations that might be a good fit for you Tauruses right now: Athens, Greece in 459 B.C.; Constantinople in 1179; Florence, Italy in 1489; New York in 2037. In general, you would thrive wherever there are lots of bright people co-creating a lively culture that offers maximum stimulation. You need to have your certainties challenged and your mind expanded and your sense of wonder piqued. 



What new influences will be headed your way in 2013? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? How can you make best use of these influences and resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in!

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Will archaeologists find definitive evidence of the magical lost continent of Atlantis in 2013? Probably not. How about Shambhala, the mythical kingdom in Central Asia where the planet's greatest spiritual masters are said to live? Any chance it will be discovered by Indiana Jones-style fortune hunters? Again, not likely. But I do think there's a decent chance that sometime in the next seven months, many of you Geminis will discover places, situations, and circumstances that will be, for all intents and purposes, magical and mythical.



Do you understand just how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2013? Are you fully aware of just how much access you have to new resources?

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

There's a spot in the country of Panama where you can watch the sun rise in the east over the Pacific Ocean. In another Panamanian location, you can see the sun set in the west over the Atlantic Ocean. Nothing weird is involved. Nothing twisted or unearthly. It's simply a quirk of geography. I suspect that a similar situation will be at work in your life sometime soon. Things may seem out of place. Your sense of direction might be off-kilter, and even your intuition could seem to be playing tricks on you. But don't worry. Have no fear. Life is simply asking you to expand your understanding of what "natural" and "normal" are.



Would you like some inspiration as you muse and wonder about your upcoming adventures in 2013? Do you long to slip out of your habitual thoughts about your life and get a more transcendent view?

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Metaphorically speaking, a pebble was in your shoe the whole past week. You kept thinking, "Pretty soon I've got to take a minute to get rid of that thing," and yet you never did. Why is that? While it wasn't enormously painful, it distracted you just enough to keep you from giving your undivided attention to the important tasks at hand. Now here's a news flash: The damn pebble is still in your shoe. Can I persuade you to remove it? Please?



What hidden factors will be massaging your destiny in 2013? Could you use some hints about how to prepare for the adventures awaiting you in the next 12 months?

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Even when you know exactly what you want, it's sometimes crucial for you not to accomplish it too fast. It may be that you need to mature more before you're ready to handle your success. It could be that if you got all of your heart's desire too quickly and easily, you wouldn't develop the vigorous willpower that the quest was meant to help you forge. The importance of good timing can't be underestimated, either: In order for you to take full advantage of your dream-come-true, many other factors in your life have to be in place and arranged just so. With those thoughts in mind, Virgo, I offer you this prediction for 2013: A benevolent version of a perfect storm is headed your way. 



What will be the story of your life in 2013? How can you exert your free will to create the adventures that'll bring out the best in you, even as you find graceful ways to cooperate with the tides of destiny?

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Artists who painted images in caves 30,000 years ago did a pretty good job of depicting the movements of four-legged animals like horses. In fact, they were more skilled than today's artists. Even the modern experts who illustrate animal anatomy textbooks don't match the accuracy of the people who decorated cave walls millennia ago. So says a study reported in Livescience.com (http://tinyurl.com/CaveArtMagic). I'd like to suggest this is a useful metaphor for you to consider, Libra. There's some important task that the old you did better than the new you does. Now would be an excellent time to recapture the lost magic.



Do you really know how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2013? Probably not. But I'd like to help you know about that power, and tap into it.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

After evaluating your astrological omens for the coming months, I've decided to name you Scorpios the "Top Sinners of the Year" for 2013. What that means is that I suspect your vices will be more inventive and more charming than those of all the other signs. Your so-called violations may have the effect of healing some debilitating habit. In fact, your "sins" may not be immoral or wicked at all. They might actually be beautiful transgressions that creatively transcend the status quo; they might be imaginative improvements on the half-assed way that things have always been done. To ensure you're always being ethical in your outlaw behavior, be committed to serving the greater good at least as much as your own selfish interests.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Here's the horoscope I hope to be able to write for you a year from now: "Your mind just kept opening further and further during these past 12 months, Sagittarius -- way beyond what I ever imagined possible. Congrats! Even as you made yourself more innocent and receptive than you've been in a long time, you were constantly getting smarter and sharpening your ability to see the raw truth of what was unfolding. Illusions and misleading fantasies did not appeal to you. Again, kudos!"



Who do you want to become in 2013? Where do you want to go and what do you want to do? I'm ready to help you muse about the interesting possibilities.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

What does it mean when the dwarf planet Pluto impacts a key point in your horoscope? For Capricorn gymnast Gabby Douglas, it seemed to be profoundly empowering. During the time Pluto was close to her natal sun during last year's Summer Olympics, she won two gold medals, one with her team and one by herself. Luck had very little to do with her triumph. Hard work, self-discipline, and persistence were key factors. I'm predicting that Pluto's long cruise through the sign of Capricorn will give you an opportunity to earn a Gabby Douglas-like achievement in your own sphere -- if, that is, you can summon the same level of willpower and determination that she did. Now would be an excellent time to formally commit yourself to the glorious cause that excites you the most.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"Diplomacy is the art of saying 'nice doggie' until you can find a rock," said humorist Will Rogers. I hope you've been taking care of the "nice doggie" part, Aquarius -- holding the adversarial forces and questionable influences at bay. As for the rock: I predict you will find it any minute now, perhaps even within an hour of reading this horoscope. Please keep in mind that you won't necessarily have to throw the rock for it to serve its purpose. Merely brandishing it should be enough.

Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Do you know the word "cahoots"? Strictly speaking, it means to be in league with allies who have the same intentions as you do; to scheme and dream with confederates whose interests overlap with yours. Let's expand that definition a little further and make it one of your central themes in the coming week. For your purposes, "cahoots" will signify the following: to conspire with like-minded companions as you cook up some healthy mischief or whip up an interesting commotion or instigate a benevolent ruckus.



As you plunge into 2013, would you like to clarify your purpose? Are there fantasies playing at the back of your mind that you'd like to bring fully into your awareness? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In 2013, I pledge to conspire with you to increase your mastery of the art of friendship. Together we will concentrate on making you an even stronger ally than you already are. We will upgrade your skill at expressing your feelings with open-hearted clarity, and in ways that don't make people defensive. We will also inspire you to help others communicate effectively in your presence. I hope you understand that doing this work will empower you to accomplish feats that were never before possible for you.



As you plunge in to 2013, would you like to clarify your purpose? Are there fantasies playing at the back of your mind that you'd like to bring fully into your awareness? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 2 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in!

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Chickens and alligators share a common ancestor. Seventy million years ago, they were both archosaurs. That's why chickens possess a gene that has the ability to grow teeth. A few years ago, a biological researcher at the University of Wisconsin managed to activate this capacity, inducing a few mutant chickens to sprout alligator teeth. I predict there will be a metaphorically comparable event happening for you in 2013, Taurus. The "chicken" part of you will acquire some of the gravitas of an alligator.



Are you ready to shed your superstitious fears about the future? Would you like to slip into 2013 armed with an influx of confidence and poise? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 2 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"People wish to learn to swim and at the same time to keep one foot on the ground," said French novelist Marcel Proust. An attitude like that is always a barrier to growth, of course, but in 2013 it would be especially ill-advised for you Geminis. In order to win full possession of the many blessings that will be offering themselves to you, you will have to give up your solid footing and dive into the depths over and over again. That may sometimes be a bit nerve-racking. But it should also generate the most fun you've had in years.



What new influences will be headed your way in 2013? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? How can you make best use of these influences and resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 2 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Here's the horoscope I hope to be able to write for you a year from now: You escaped the chains that kept you enslaved to your primary source of suffering. You broke the trance it kept you in, and you freed yourself from its demoralizing curse. Now you have forged a resilient new relationship with your primary source of suffering -- a relationship that allows you to deal with it only when it's healthy for you to do so and only when you feel strong enough to do it. Very nicely done! Congratulations! Excellent work!



Do you understand just how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2013? Are you fully aware of just how much access you have to new resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 2 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"In this world," said Oscar Wilde, "there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it." I'm counting on you to refute the last part of that questionable assertion, Leo. According to my analysis of the long-term astrological omens, you will definitely be getting what you want in the next six months. You will receive your prize . . . you will earn your badge . . . you will win a big game or claim your birthright or find your treasure. When that happens, I trust you will make sure it is an enduring blessing. There will be no sadness involved!



Would you like some inspiration as you muse and wonder about your upcoming adventures in 2013? Do you long to slip out of your habitual thoughts about your life and get a more transcendent view?

Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

English poet Alfred Tennyson wrote so many memorable lines that he is among the top ten most frequently cited authors in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. One of his most famous passages was "'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all." When he was on his death bed at age 83, his enigmatic last words were, "I have opened it." Let's make that declaration your mantra for the coming year, Virgo. In your case, it will have nothing to do with death, but just the opposite. It will be your way of announcing your entrance into a brighter, lustier, more fertile phase of your life. Try saying it right now: "I have opened it!"



What hidden factors will be massaging your destiny in 2013? Could you use some hints about how to prepare for the adventures awaiting you in the next 12 months? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 2 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Back in 1830, it was expensive to stay up and do things in your room after dark. To earn enough money to pay for the whale oil that would light your lamp for an hour, you had to work for 5.4 hours. And today? It's cheaper. You have to put in less than a second of hard labor to afford an hour's worth of light. I suspect that in 2013 there will be a similar boost in your ease at getting the light you need to illuminate your journey. I'm speaking metaphorically here, as in the insight that arises from your intuition, the emotional energy that comes from those you care about, and the grace of the Divine Wow. All that good stuff will be increasing. 



What will be the story of your life in 2013? How can you exert your free will to create the adventures that'll bring out the best in you, even as you find graceful ways to cooperate with the tides of destiny? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 2 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life," said Scorpio painter Georgia O'Keeffe, "and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing I wanted to do." I think her declaration is excellent medicine for you. In 2013, you will have great potential for upgrading your relationship with your fears -- not necessarily suppressing them or smashing them, but rather using them more consistently as a springboard, capitalizing on the emotions they unleash, and riding the power they motivate you to summon. 



Do you really know how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2013? Probably not. But I'd like to help you know about that power, and tap into it. This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 2 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"Ambition can creep as well as soar," said Irish philosopher Edmund Burke. That will be good for you to remember throughout 2013, Sagittarius. Later this year, the time may come for your ambition to soar -- in the month of April, for example, and again in the month of August. But for the foreseeable future, I think your ambition will operate best if you keep it contained and intense, moving slowly and gradually, attending to the gritty details with supreme focus.



What are your plans for the coming year? Could you use some more help mapping out your dreams and schemes? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 2 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In Tom Robbins' book Skinny Legs and All, one of the characters, Ellen Cherry, has a conversation with a voice in her head. The voice gives her a piece of advice: "The trick is this: keep your eye on the ball. Even when you can't see the ball." I think that happens to be excellent counsel for you to heed during the next six months, Capricorn. You may not always be able to figure out what the hell is going on, but that shouldn't affect your commitment to doing the right thing. Your job is to keep your own karma clean and pure -- and not worry about anyone else's karma.



Who do you want to become in 2013? Where do you want to go and what do you want to do? I'm ready to help you muse about the interesting possibilities. This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES feature Part 2 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

I'll be bold and predict that 2013 will be a time when you'll discover more about the art of happiness than you have in years. Here are some clues to get you started. 1. "It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere." -Agnes Repplier. 2. "There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things that are beyond the power of our will." -Epictetus. 3. "For the rational, healthy person, the desire for pleasure is the desire to celebrate his control over reality. For the neurotic, the desire for pleasure is the desire to escape from reality." -Nathaniel Branden. 4. "Our happiness springs mainly from moderate troubles, which afford the mind a healthful stimulus, and are followed by a reaction which produces a cheerful flow of spirits." -E. Wigglesworth. 5. "Happiness is essentially a state of going somewhere, wholeheartedly, one-directionally, without regret or reservation." -William H. Sheldon. 6. "We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life, when all that we need to make us really happy is something to be enthusiastic about." -Charles Kingsley.



What new influences will be headed your way in 2013? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on?

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In 2013, I pledge to help you feel at peace and in love with your body; I will do everything in my power to encourage you to triumph over media-induced delusions that tempt you to wish you were different from who you actually are. My goal is to be one of your resourceful supporters in the coming months -- to be a member of your extensive team of allies. And I will be working with you to ensure that this team grows to just the right size and provides you with just the right foundation. If all goes well, your extra help will ensure that you finish almost everything you start in the coming year. You will regularly conquer everyday chaos and be a master of artful resolutions.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the sci-fi film trilogy The Matrix, the heroes are able to instantaneously acquire certain complex skills via software that's downloaded directly into their brains. In this way, the female hacker named Trinity masters the art of piloting a military M-109 helicopter in just a few minutes. If you could choose a few downloads like that, Aries, what would they be? This isn't just a rhetorical question meant for your amusement. In 2013, I expect that your educational capacity will be exceptional. While you may not be able to add new skills as easily as Trinity, you'll be pretty fast and efficient. So what do you want to learn? Choose wisely.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Are you familiar with the fable of the golden goose? The farmer who owned it became impatient because it laid only one gold egg per day. So he killed it, thinking he would thereby get the big chunk of gold that must be inside its body. Alas, his theory was mistaken. There was no chunk. From then on, of course, he no longer got his modest daily treasure. I nominate this fable to be one of your top teaching stories of 2013. As long as you're content with a slow, steady rate of enrichment, you'll be successful. Pushing extra hard to expedite the flow might lead to problems.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Here are some of the experiences I hope to help you harvest in the coming year: growing pains that are interesting and invigorating rather than stressful; future shock that feels like a fun joyride rather than a bumpy rumble; two totally new and original ways to get excited; a good reason to have faith in a dream that has previously been improbable; a fresh supply of Innocent Crazy-Wise Love Truth; and access to all the borogoves, mome raths, and slithy toves you could ever want.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In her gallery show "Actuality, Reminiscence, and Fabrication," artist Deborah Sullivan includes a piece called "Penance 1962." It consists of a series of handwritten statements that repeats a central theme: "I must not look at boys during prayer." I'm assuming it's based on her memory of being in church or Catholic school when she was a teenager. You probably have an analogous rule lodged somewhere in the depths of your unconscious mind -- an outmoded prohibition or taboo that may still be subtly corroding your life energy. The coming year will be an excellent time to banish that ancient nonsense for good. If you were Deborah Sullivan, I'd advise you to fill a whole notebook page with the corrected assertion: "It's OK to look at boys during prayer."

Leo (July 23-August 22)

For years, the gravestone of Irish dramatist Oscar Wilde was covered with kiss-shaped lipstick marks that were left by his admirers. Unfortunately, Wilde's descendants decided to scour away all those blessings and erect a glass wall around the tomb to prevent further displays of affection. In my astrological opinion, Leo, you should favor the former style of behavior over the latter in 2013. In other words, don't focus on keeping things neat and clean and well-ordered. On the contrary: Be extravagant and uninhibited in expressing your love for the influences that inspire you -- even at the risk of being a bit unruly or messy.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In 2013, I hope to conspire with you to raise your levels of righteous success. If you're a struggling songwriter, I'll be pushing for you to get your music out to more people -- without sacrificing your artistic integrity. If you're a kindergarten teacher, I'll prompt you to fine-tune and deepen the benevolent influence you have on your students. If you're a business owner, I'll urge you to ensure that the product or service you offer is a well-honed gift to those who use it. As I trust you can see, Virgo, I'm implying that impeccable ethics will be crucial to your ascent in the coming year.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

After Libran poet Wallace Stevens won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1955, Harvard University offered him a job as a full professor. But he turned it down. He couldn't bear leaving his day job as the vice-president of an insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut. I suspect that in the first half of 2013, you will come to a fork in the road that may feel something like Stevens' quandary. Should you stick with what you know or else head off in the direction of more intense and unpredictable stimulation? I'm not here to tell you which is the better choice; I simply want to make sure you clearly identify the nature of the decision.



What hidden factors will be massaging your destiny in 2013? Could you use some hints about how to prepare for the adventures awaiting you in the next eight to twelve months? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2013. Tune in!

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In 2013, I will try to help you retool, reinvent, and reinvigorate yourself in every way that's important to you. I will encourage you to reawaken one of your sleeping aptitudes, recapture a lost treasure, and reanimate a dream you've neglected. If you're smart, Scorpio, you will reallocate resources that got misdirected or wasted. And I hope you will reapply for a privilege or position you were previously denied, because I bet you'll win it this time around.  Here are your words of power for the year ahead: resurrection and redemption.



What will be the story of your life in 2013? How can you exert your free will to create the adventures that'll bring out the best in you, even as you find graceful ways to cooperate with the tides of destiny?

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Based on experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, a team of physicists in France and Switzerland announced last July that they had tentatively discovered the Higgs Boson, which is colloquially known as the "God particle." What's all the fuss? In her San Francisco Chronicle column, Leah Garchik quoted an expert who sought to explain: "The Higgs boson is the WD40 and duct tape of the universe, all rolled into one." Is there a metaphorical equivalent of such a glorious and fundamental thing in your life, Sagittarius? If not, I predict you will find it in 2013. If there already is, I expect you will locate and start using its 2.0 version.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In 2013, I pledge to help you bring only the highest-quality influences and self-responsible people into your life. Together we will work to dispel any unconscious attraction you might have to demoralizing chaos or pathological melodrama. We will furthermore strive to ensure that as you deepen and fine-tune your self-discipline, it will not be motivated by self-denial or obsessive control-freak tendencies. Rather, it will be an act of love that you engage in so as to intensify your ability to express yourself freely and beautifully.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"Genius is the ability to renew one's emotions in daily experience," said French painter Paul Cezanne. What do you think he meant by that? Here's one interpretation: Many of us replay the same old emotions over and over again -- even in response to experiences that are nothing like the past events when we felt those exact feelings. So a genius might be someone who generates a fresh emotion for each new adventure. Here's another possible interpretation of Cezanne's remark: It can be hard to get excited about continually repeating the basic tasks of our regular routines day after day. But a genius might be someone who is good at doing just that. I think that by both of these definitions, 2013 could be a genius year for you Aquarians.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Home is not just the building where you live. It's more than the community that gives you support and the patch of earth that comforts you with its familiarity. Home is any place where you're free to be your authentic self; it's any power spot where you can think your own thoughts and see with your own eyes. I hope and trust that in 2013 you will put yourself in position to experience this state of mind as often as possible. Do you have any ideas about how to do that? Brainstorm about it on a regular basis for the next six months.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Isaac Newton is regarded as one of the most influential scientists in history. But the time he spent as a member of the English Parliament was undistinguished. The only public comment he ever made while serving there was a request to close the window because he was cold. Basketball star Michael Jordan had a similar schism. In the prime of his outstanding career, he took a year off to try playing baseball, which he did poorly. After analyzing 2013's astrological aspects, Aries, I'm guessing that you should cultivate a firm intention to avoid doing what Newton and Jordan did. Keep playing to your strengths and emphasizing what you love. Don't get sidetracked by peripheral concerns.



This week my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES offer you a teaser look at some of the major themes you will be working and playing with in 2013. Start dreaming and scheming about who you're going to be in the new year!
(Beginning December 25, I will devote three consecutive weeks of EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES to an in-depth discussion of your long-range outlook for the coming months. Tune in!)


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Can you manage to be both highly alert and deeply relaxed? Could you be wildly curious and yet also serenely reflective? Can you imagine yourself being extra hungry to crack life's secrets but also at peace with your destiny exactly the way it is? If you can honestly answer yes to those questions, you'll get a lot of help in the coming week. The universe may even seem to be conspiring to educate you and heal you. You will receive a steady flow of clues about how to get closer to living your dreams.



Want more clues? Need further insight? For more evocative questions and pithy suggestions about your unfolding destiny, check out your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Spencer Silver was a co-inventor of Post-it notes, those small, colorful pieces of paper you can temporarily attach to things and then remove to use again and again. Speaking about the process he went through to develop this simple marvel, he said, "If I had thought about it, I wouldn't have done the experiment. The literature was full of examples that said you can't do this." I'd like to make him your patron saint for the next few weeks, Aries. Like him, you now have the chance to make practical breakthroughs that may have seemed impossible, or at least unlikely. Ignore conventional wisdom -- including your own. Trust your mischievous intuition.



You can learn to be lucky. It's not a mystical force you're born with, but a habit you can develop. How? For starters, be open to new experiences, trust your gut wisdom, expect good fortune, see the bright side of challenging events, and master the art of maximizing serendipitous opportunities. For more help, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"They are trying to make me into a fixed star," complained religious leader Martin Luther a few centuries ago. "I am an irregular planet." I invite you to use that declaration as your own in the coming weeks. You have every right to avoid being pinned down, pigeonholed, and forced to be consistent. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you need abundant freedom to mutate your identity. You deserve a poetic license that allows you to play a variety of different roles and explore the pleasures of unpredictable self-expression.



Would you like further inspiration as you scheme and dream to make the most of life's sometimes puzzling opportunities? Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Don't think about making art, just get it done," said Andy Warhol. "Let everyone else decide if it's good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. While they are deciding, make even more art." I encourage you to adopt that mini-manifesto for your own purposes in the coming weeks, Aries. If you're not an artist, simply substitute the appropriate phrase for "making art." It could be "creating interesting relationships," "exploring exotic lands," "changing corrupt political institutions," "fixing environmental problems," or even "making money." The main point is: Focus on doing what drives your quest for meaning, and forget about what people think of it.



How much do you want to know about your life? How far do you dare to go in your quest for self-mastery? For more insight into your intriguing fate, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In old Christian and Islamic lore, the dove was a symbol of the holy spirit. The bird was considered so pure and sacred that the devil, who was an expert shapeshifter, could not take on its form. The dove had a different meaning in other traditions, however. Among the ancient Greeks, it had a special relationship with Aphrodite, the goddess of love. In Rome, its eggs were regarded as aphrodisiacs. Drawing on all these meanings, I'm nominating the dove to be your power animal in the coming week. You will have an excellent chance to intensify your connection with divine truths through the power of love and eros -- and vice versa.



Somewhere there's a treasure that has no value to anyone but you, and a secret that's meaningless to everyone except you, and a frontier that harbors a revelation only you would know how to exploit. Why not go in search of those things? For inspiration, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The data that's stored and disseminated on the Internet is unimaginably voluminous. And yet the 540 billion trillion electrons that carry all this information weigh about the same as a strawberry. I'd like to use this fun fact as a metaphor for the work you're doing these days -- and the play, too. Your output is prodigious. Your intensity is on the verge of becoming legendary. The potency of your efforts is likely to set in motion effects that will last for a long time. And yet, to the naked eye or casual observer, it all might look as simple and light as a strawberry.



What exactly are you looking for? How would you describe the experiences you want more than anything else? It's possible my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE could give you additional help in figuring that out.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Big opportunities are coming up for you. Even if you cash in on them, though, they aren't likely to make an immediate practical impact. They are subtle and deep, these prospects. They have the potential of catalyzing monumental shifts in your long-term unfolding, but will take a while to transform your day-to-day rhythm. So what are these openings? Here are my guesses: 1. You could root out a bad seed that got embedded in your subconscious mind before you knew any better. 2. You could reinterpret the meaning of certain turning points in your past, thereby revising the flow of your life story. 3. You could forgive yourself for an old sin you thought you'd never let go of. 4. You could receive a friendly shock that will diminish some sadness you've carried for a long time.



Would you like to hear more about the hidden factors influencing your life? Do you want to uncover the secrets you've been hiding even from yourself? Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the coming days, many of your important tasks will be best accomplished through caginess and craftiness. Are you willing to work behind the scenes and beneath the surface? I suspect you will have a knack for navigating your way skillfully and luckily through mazes and their metaphorical equivalents. The mists may very well part at your command, revealing clues that no one else but you can get access to. You might also have a talent for helping people to understand elusive or difficult truths. Halloween costume suggestions: spy, stage magician, ghost whisperer, exorcist.



When they say "Be yourself," which self do they mean? Certainly not the self that wants to win every game and use up every resource and stand alone at the end of time on a mountain of pretty garbage. So which self is it? For guidance, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro laid waste to Peru in 1532, his soldiers found green stones on the land. Were they emeralds? A priest who was traveling with them gave them bad advice. He said that the way to determine whether they were merely colored glass or else precious gems was to test their hardness by pounding them with hammers. In this manner, many actual emeralds were shattered into fragments. Learn from this mistake, Aries. Make sure you recognize treasures for what they are. And don't force them to submit to unwise tests that misconstrue their true nature.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Ten percent of all sexually suggestive text messages are delivered to the wrong number. Take precautions to make sure you're not among that ten percent in the coming weeks. It will be extra important for you to be scrupulous in communicating about eros and intimacy. The stakes will be higher than usual. Togetherness is likely to either become more intensely interesting or else more intensely confusing -- and it's largely up to you which direction it goes. For best results, express yourself clearly and with maximum integrity.



Do you wish you could get more clarity about the foggy, ambiguous situations you're dealing with? Want more help in exploring the Great Mystery that is your life? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"In a full heart there is room for everything," said poet Antonio Porchia, "and in an empty heart there is room for nothing." That's an important idea for you to meditate on right now, Aries. The universe is conspiring for you to be visited by a tide of revelations about intimacy. And yet you won't be available to get the full benefit of that tide unless your heart is as full as possible. Wouldn't you love to be taught more about love and togetherness and collaboration?



Take inventory of the extent that "No" dominates your life. Notice how often you say or think: 1. "That's not right." 2. "I don't like that." 3. "I don't agree with that." 4. "They don't like me." 5. "I'm not very good." 6. "That should be different from what it is." For help in retraining yourself to say "Yes!" at least 51% of the time, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Here's the curious message I derived from the current astrological configurations: It's one of those rare times when a wall may actually help bring people together. How? Why? The omens don't reveal that specific information. They only tell me that what seems like a barrier might end up serving as a connector. An influence that in other situations would tend to cause separation will in this case be likely to promote unity. Capitalize on this anomaly, Aries!

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For every trillion dollars the U.S. government spends on the military, it creates about 11,000 jobs. That same expenditure, if directed toward education, creates 27,000 jobs. Personally, I'd rather have the taxes I pay go to teachers than soldiers -- especially in light of the fact that the U.S. spends almost as much money on its military as all the other nations in the world combined spend on theirs. I suggest that in the coming months you make a metaphorically similar move, Aries. Devote more of your time and energy and resources to learning, and less to fighting. Ironically, doing that will ultimately diminish the fighting you have to do. As you get more training and wisdom, you'll become more skilled at avoiding unnecessary conflicts.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You will never be able to actually gaze upon your own face. You may of course see a reasonable likeness of it in mirrors, photos, and videos. But the real thing will always be forever visible to everyone else, but not you. I think that's an apt symbol for how hard it is to get a totally objective view of your own soul. No matter how sincere you may be in your efforts to see yourself clearly, there will always be fuzziness, misapprehensions, and ignorance. Having said that, though, I want you to know that the coming weeks will be an excellent time to see yourself better than ever before.



How's your fight for freedom going? Are you making progress in liberating yourself from your unconscious obsessions, bad habits, and conditioned responses? For assistance and inspiration, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Life tests you all the time. Sometimes its prods and queries are hard and weird; they come at you with non-stop intensity. On other occasions the riddles and lessons are pretty fun and friendly, and provide you with lots of slack to figure them out. In all cases, life's tests offer you the chance to grow smarter, both in your head and heart. They challenge you to stretch your capacities and invite you to reduce your suffering. Right now, oddly enough, you have some choice in what kinds of tests you'd prefer. Just keep in mind that the more interesting they are, the bigger the rewards are likely to be.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm afraid your vibes are slightly out of tune. Can you do something about that, please? Meanwhile, your invisible friend could really use a Tarot reading, and your houseplants would benefit from a dose of Mozart. Plus -- and I hope I'm not being too forward here -- your charmingly cluttered spots are spiraling into chaotic sprawl, and your slight tendency to overreact is threatening to devolve into a major proclivity. As for that rather shabby emotional baggage of yours: Would you consider hauling it to the dump? In conclusion, my dear Ram, you're due for a few adjustments.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Do you know what a controlled burn is? Firefighters start small, manageable fires on purpose so as to eradicate brush that has accumulated too close to wooded areas. With less fuel around, bigger fires are not as likely to ignite accidentally and turn into conflagrations. I encourage you to use this as a metaphor for your own life, Aries. How? First, identify a big potential problem that may be looming on the horizon. Then, in the coming weeks, get rid of all the small messes that might tend to feed that big problem. Make sure it'll never happen.



Assume that your drive to experience pleasure isn't a barrier to your spiritual growth, but is in fact essential to it. Proceed on the hypothesis that cultivating joy can make you a more ethical and compassionate person. Imagine that feeling good has something important to teach you every day. For inspiration in practicing this approach, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

These days you have a knack for reclamation and redemption, Aries. If anyone can put fun into what's dysfunctional, it's you. You may even be able to infuse neurotic cluelessness with a dose of erotic playfulness. So be confident in your ability to perform real magic in tight spots. Be alert for opportunities to transform messy irrelevancy into sparkly intrigue. By the way, how do you feel about the term "resurrection"? I suggest you strip away any previous associations you might have had, and be open to the possibility that you can find new meanings for it.

Apollo astronaut Russell Schweickart had a vision of loveliness while flying through outer space in his lunar module. "One of the most beautiful sights is a urine dump at sunset," he testified. He said it resembles a "spray of sparklers," as ten million little ice crystals shoot out into the void at high velocity. As you feed your quest for a lusty life, Aries, I urge you to be as quirky and resourceful as Schweickart. Come up with your own definitions about what's gorgeous and revelatory. Take epiphanies any way you can get them.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The astrological omens suggest that you now have a lot in common with the legendary Most Interesting Man in the World -- adventurous, unpredictable, interesting, lucky, one-of-a-kind. To create your horoscope, I have therefore borrowed a few selected details from his ad campaign's descriptions of him. Here we go: In the coming weeks, you will be the life of parties you don't even attend. Astronauts will be able to see your charisma from outer space. Up to one-third of your body weight will be gravitas. Your cell phone will always have good reception, even in a subway 100 feet underground. Panhandlers will give you money. You could challenge your reflection to a staring contest -- and win. You'll be able to keep one eye on the past while looking into the future. When you sneeze, God will say "God bless you."



"Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show." So begins Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield. I'd like to inspire you to write a story of your own that begins like that. For help, tune into your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In your personal chart, the planet Uranus symbolizes those special talents you have that are especially useful to other people. Which aspects of your soulful beauty are potentially of greatest service to the world? How can you express your uniqueness in ways that activate your most profound generosity? If you learn the answers to these questions, you will make great progress toward solving the riddle that Uranus poses. I'm happy to report that the coming years will provide you with excellent opportunities to get to the bottom of this mystery. And now would be a good time to launch a concerted effort.

Acro-Yoga is a relatively new physical discipline. According to a description I read on a flyer in Santa Cruz, it "blends the spiritual wisdom of yoga, the loving kindness of massage, and the dynamic power of acrobatics." I'd love to see you work on creating a comparable hybrid in the coming months, Aries -- some practice or system or approach that would allow you to weave together your various specialties into a synergetic whole. Start brainstorming about that impossible dream now, and soon it won't seem so impossible.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

During an author tour a few years ago, I was a guest on San Francisco radio station KFOG. For a while, the host interviewed me about my book and astrology column. Then we moved into a less formal mode, bantering about psychic powers, lucid dreams, and reincarnation. Out of nowhere, the host asked me, "So who was I in my past life?" Although I'm not in the habit of reading people's previous incarnations, I suddenly and inexplicably had the sense that I knew exactly who he had been: Savonarola, a controversial 15th-century Italian friar. I suspect you may soon have comparable experiences, Aries. Don't be surprised if you are able to glean new revelations about the past and come to fresh insights about how history has unfolded.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Members of the Nevada Republican Party have concocted a bizarre version of family values. A large majority of them are opposed to gay marriage and yet are all in favor of legal brothels. Their wacky approach to morality is as weird as that of the family values crowd in Texas, which thinks it's wrong to teach adolescents about birth control even though this has led to a high rate of teen pregnancies. My question is, why do we let people with screwed-up priorities claim to be the prime caretakers of "family values"? In accordance with the astrological omens, I urge you to reject the conventional wisdom as you clarify what that term means to you. It's an excellent time to deepen and strengthen your moral foundation.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you play solitaire, your luck will be crazy strong in the coming weeks. If you have candid, wide-ranging talks with yourself in the mirror, the revelations are likely to be as interesting as if you had spoken directly with the river god or the angel of the sunrise. Taking long walks alone could lead to useful surprises, and so would crafting a new declaration of independence for yourself. It'll also be an excellent time to expand your skills at giving yourself pleasure. Please understand that I'm not advising you to be isolated and lonely. I merely want to emphasize the point that you're due for some breakthroughs in your relationship with yourself.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Are you in possession of a talent or interest or inclination or desire that no one else has? Is there some unique way you express what it means to be human? According to my understanding of the long-term astrological omens, the coming months will be your time to cultivate this specialty with unprecedented intensity; it'll be a window of opportunity to be more practical than ever before in making your signature mark on the world. Between now and your next birthday, I urge you to be persistent in celebrating the one-of-a-kind truth that is your individuality.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"Message in a bottle" is not just a pirate movie cliche. It's a form of communication that has been used throughout history for serious purposes. England's Queen Elizabeth I even appointed an official "Uncorker of Ocean Bottles." And as recently as 2005, a message in a bottle saved the lives of 88 refugees adrift in the Caribbean Sea on a damaged boat. Glass, it turns out, is an excellent container for carrying sea-born dispatches. It lasts a long time and can even survive hurricanes. In accordance with the astrological omens, I nominate "message in a bottle" to be your metaphor for the rest of 2012. One way to apply this theme is as follows: Create a message you'd like to send to the person you will be in five years, perhaps a declaration of what your highest aspirations will be between now and then. Write it on paper and stash it in a bottle. Store this time capsule in a place you won't forget, and open it in 2017.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Every 10,000 years or so, reports the Weekly World News, hell actually does freeze over. A rare storm brings a massive amount of snow and ice to the infernal regions, and even the Lake of Fire looks like a glacier. "Satan himself was seen wearing earmuffs and making a snowman," the story says about the last time it happened. I foresee a hell-freezes-over type of event happening for you in the coming months, Cancerian -- and I mean that in a good way. The seemingly impossible will become possible; what's lost will be found and what's bent will be made straight; the lion will lie down not only with the lamb but also with the sasquatch. For best results, be ready to shed your expectations at a moment's notice.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"In purely spiritual matters, God grants all desires," said philosopher and activist Simone Weil. "Those who have less have asked for less." I think this is a worthy hypothesis for you to try out in the next nine months, Leo. To be clear: It doesn't necessarily mean you will get a dream job and perfect lover and ten million dollars. (Although I'm not ruling that out.) What it does suggest is this: You can have any relationship with the Divine Wow that you dare to imagine; you can get all the grace you need to understand why your life is the way it is; you can make tremendous progress as you do the life-long work of liberating yourself from your suffering.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

A plain old ordinary leap of faith might not be ambitious enough for you in the coming months, Virgo. I suspect your potential is more robust than that, more primed for audacity. How would you feel about attempting a quantum leap of faith? Here's what I mean by that: a soaring pirouette that sends you flying over the nagging obstacle and up onto higher ground, where the views are breathtakingly vast instead of gruntingly half-vast.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"The dream which is not fed with dream disappears," said writer Antonio Porchia. Ain't that the truth! Especially for you right now. These last few months, you've been pretty good at attending to the details of your big dreams. You've taken the practical approach and done the hard work. But beginning any moment, it will be time for you to refresh your big dreams with an infusion of fantasies and brainstorms. You need to return to the source of your excitement and feed it and feed it and feed it.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

A Chinese businessman named Hu Xilin is the champion fly-killer of the world. Ever since one of the buzzing pests offended him back in 1997 -- causing havoc at a dinner where he was entertaining a potential business partner -- he has made it his mission to fight back. He says he has exterminated more than ten million of the enemy with his patented "Fly Slayer" machine. And oh by the way, his obsession has made him a millionaire. It's possible, Scorpio, that your story during the second half of 2012 will have elements in common with Hu Xilin's. Is there any bad influence you could work to minimize or undo in such a way that it might ultimately earn you perks and prizes -- or at least deep satisfaction?

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

From the 14th through the 18th centuries, many towns in England observed a curious custom. If a couple could prove that they had gone a year and a day without ever once being sorry they got married, the two of them would receive an award: a side of cured pork, known as a flitch of bacon. Alas, the prize was rarely claimed. If this practice were still in effect, you Sagittarians would have an elevated chance of bringing home the bacon in the coming months. Your ability to create harmony and mutual respect in an intimate relationship will be much higher than usual.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"If I had my life to live over," said Nadine Stair at age 85, "I would perhaps have more actual problems, but I'd have fewer imaginary ones." I suggest you write out that quote, Capricorn, and keep it close to you for the next six months. Your task, as I see it, will be to train yourself so you can expertly distinguish actual problems from imaginary ones. Part of your work, of course, will be to get in the habit of immediately ejecting any of the imaginary kind the moment you notice them creeping up on you.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Astronomer Percival Lowell (1855-1916) was instrumental in laying the groundwork that led to the discovery of Pluto. He was a visionary pioneer who helped change our conception of the solar system. But he also put forth a wacky notion or two. Among the most notable: He declared, against a great deal of contrary evidence, that the planet Mars was laced with canals. You have the potential be a bit like him in the coming months, Aquarius: mostly a wellspring of innovation but sometimes a source of errant theories. What can you do to ensure that the errant theories have minimal effect? Be humble and ask for feedback.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Throughout the 16th century and even beyond, European explorers trekked through the New World hunting for the mythical land of El Dorado: the Lost City of Gold. The precious metal was supposedly so abundant there that it was even used to make children's toys. The quest was ultimately futile, although it led the explorers to stumble upon lesser treasures of practical value -- the potato, for example. After being brought over to Europe from South America, it became a staple food. I'm foreseeing a comparable progression in your own world during the coming months: You may not locate the gold, but you'll find the equivalent of the potato.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Swans, geese, and ducks molt all their flight feathers at once, which means they may be unable to fly for several weeks afterwards. We humans don't do anything like that in a literal way, but we have a psychological analog: times when we shed outworn self-images. I suspect you're coming up on such a transition, Aries. While you're going through it, you may want to lie low. Anything resembling flight -- launching new ventures, making big decisions, embarking on great adventures -- should probably be postponed until the metamorphosis is complete and your feathers grow back.



The year is half-over! You're invited to explore the big picture of your life with my IN-DEPTH, LONG-TERM AUDIO FORECAST for the coming months. Normally my Expanded Audio Horoscopes cover the immediate future. But this week, I'm reporting on the themes that I think will be important for you during the second half of 2012 and beyond. 


Where are you likely to find most success? How can you best cooperate with the cosmic rhythms? What questions should you be asking? Log in or register here.

What will be the story of your life in the second half of 2012? How can you conspire with life to create the best possible future for yourself?

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In 2011 car traffic began flowing across Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, a newly completed span that joins the city of Qingdao with the Huangdao District in China. This prodigious feat of engineering is 26.4 miles long. I nominate it to serve as your prime metaphor in the coming weeks. Picture it whenever you need a boost as you work to connect previously unlinked elements in your life. It may help inspire you to master the gritty details that'll lead to your own monumental accomplishment.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

An apple starts growing on its tree in the spring. By early summer, it may be full size and as red as it will ever be. To the naked eye, it appears ready to eat. But it's not. If you pluck it and bite into it, the taste probably won't appeal to you. If you pluck it and hope it will be more delicious in a few weeks, you'll be disappointed. So here's the moral of the story, Gemini: For an apple to achieve its potential, it has to stay on the tree until nature has finished ripening it. Keep that lesson in mind as you deal with the urge to harvest something before it has reached its prime.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"Dear Rob: In one of your recent horoscopes, you implied that I should consider the possibility of asking for more than I've ever asked for before. You didn't actually use those words, but I'm pretty sure that's what you meant. Anyway, I want to thank you! It helped me start working up the courage to burst out of my protective and imprisoning little shell. Today I gave myself permission to learn the unknowable, figure out the inscrutable, and dream the inconceivable. - Crazy Crab." Dear Crazy: You're leading the way for your fellow Cancerians. The process you just described is exactly what I advise them to try in the coming weeks.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Picture yourself moving toward a building you haven't seen before. Trust the initial image that leaps into your imagination. What type of path are you on? Concrete or dirt or brick or wood? Is it a long, winding way or short and direct? Once you arrive at the front door, locate the key. Is it under a mat or in your pocket or somewhere else? What does the key look like? Next, open the door and go inside to explore. Where have you arrived? See everything in detail. This is a test that has no right or wrong answers, Leo -- similar to what your life is actually bringing you right now. The building you've envisioned represents the next phase of your destiny. The path symbolizes how you get here. The key is the capacity or knowledge you will need.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

My first poetry teacher suggested that it was my job as a poet to learn the names of things in the natural world. She said I should be able to identify at least 25 species of trees, 25 flowers, 25 herbs, 25 birds, and eight clouds. I have unfortunately fallen short in living up to that very modest goal, and I've always felt guilty about it. But it's never too late to begin, right? In the coming weeks, I vow to correct for my dereliction of duty. I urge you to follow my lead, Virgo. Is there any soul work that you have been neglecting? Is there any part of your life's mission that you have skipped over? Now would be an excellent time to catch up.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Here's my nomination for one of the Ten Biggest Problems in the World: our refusal to control the pictures and thoughts that pop into our minds. For example, I can personally testify that when a fearful image worms its way into the space behind my eyes, I sometimes let it stimulate a surge of negative emotions rather than just banish it or question whether it's true. I'm calling this is to your attention, Libra, because in the weeks ahead you'll have more power than usual to modulate your stream of consciousness. Have you ever seen the bumper sticker that says, "Don't believe everything you think"? Make that your mantra.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In the hands of a skilled practitioner, astrology can help you determine the most favorable days to start a new project or heat up your romantic possibilities or get a tattoo of a ninja mermaid. Success is of course still quite feasible at other times, but you might find most grace and ease if you align yourself with the cosmic flow. Let's consider, for example, the issue of you taking a vacation. According to my understanding, if you do it between now and July 23, the experiences you have will free your ass, and -- hallelujah! -- your mind will then gratefully follow. If you schedule your getaway for another time, you could still free your ass, but may have to toil more intensely to get your mind to join the fun.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

What is your most hateable and loveable obsession, Sagittarius? The compulsion that sometimes sabotages you and sometimes inspires you? The longing that can either fool you or make you smarter? Whatever it is, I suspect it's beginning a transformation. Is there anything you can do to ensure that the changes it undergoes will lead you away from the hateable consequences and closer to the loveable stuff? I think there's a lot you can do. For starters: Do a ritual -- yes, an actual ceremony -- in which you affirm your intention that your obsession will forever after serve your highest good and brightest integrity.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

As someone who thrives on simple organic food and doesn't enjoy shopping, I would not normally have lunch at a hot dog stand in a suburban mall. But that's what I did today. Nor do I customarily read books by writers whose philosophy repels me, and yet recently I have found myself skimming through Ayn Rand's The Virtue of Selfishness. I've been enjoying these acts of rebellion. They're not directed at the targets that I usually revolt against, but rather at my own habits and comforts. I suggest you enjoy similar insurrections in the coming week, Capricorn. Rise up and overthrow your attachment to boring familiarity.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

The ancient Chinese book of divination known as the I Ching speaks of "catching things before they exit the gate of change." That's what happens when a martial artist anticipates an assailant's movement before it happens, or when a healer corrects an imbalance in someone's body before it becomes a full-blown symptom or illness. I see this as an important principle for you right now, Aquarius. It's a favorable time to catch potential disturbances prior to the time they exit the gate of change. If you're alert for pre-beginnings, you should be able to neutralize or transform brewing problems so they never become problems.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Neurophysiologists say that singing really loudly can flush away metabolic waste from your cerebrum. I say that singing really loudly can help purge your soul of any tendency it might have to ignore its deepest promptings. I bring these ideas to your attention, Pisces, because I believe the current astrological omens are suggesting that you do some really loud singing. Washing the dirt and debris out of your brain will do wonders for your mental hygiene. And your soul could use a boost as it ramps up its wild power to pursue its most important dreams.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's time for your right hand to find out what your left hand has been doing lately, and vice versa. They've been attending to their separate agendas for a while, and now it would be wise to have them work together more closely. As they get reacquainted, a bit of friction would be understandable. You may have to serve as a mediator. Try to get them to play nicely with each other for a while before jumping in to the negotiations about how best they can cooperate in the future. And be very firm with them: no slapping or fighting allowed.



Special Note: My website has been broken for the past week, but it should be all better now. If the recent chaos caused you to miss last week's horoscope, you can find it HERE.



I invite you to keep a running list of all the ways life delights you and helps you and energizes you. Describe everyday miracles you take for granted . . . the uncanny powers you possess . . . the small joys that occur so routinely you forget how much they mean to you . . . the steady flow of benefits bestowed on you by people you know and don't know. What works for you? What makes you feel at home in the world? For inspiration in this noble effort, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If your destiny has gotten tweaked by bias or injustice, it's a good time to rebel. If you are being manipulated by people who care for you -- even if it's allegedly for your own good -- you now have the insight and power necessary to wriggle free of the bind. If you have been confused by the mixed messages you're getting from your own unconscious mind, you should get to the bottom of the inner contradiction. And if you have been wavering in your commitment to your oaths, you'd better be intensely honest with yourself about why that's happening.



Need more help deciphering the riddles and enigmas that are fueling your amazing story? Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Let's waltz the rumba," said jazz musician Fats Waller, suggesting the seemingly impossible mix of two very different types of dancing. That's an excellent clue for you to follow up on, Aries. I suspect that in the coming week you will have an unusual aptitude for hybridization. You could do folk dancing and hip-hop moves simultaneously. It will make sense for you to do the cha-cha as you disco and vice versa. You'll have a knack for bringing the spirit of belly dance into the tango, and for breakdancing while you do the hokey-pokey.



You're got more strength and intelligence than you realize. For help in accessing those untapped inner resources, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"My soul is a fire that suffers if it doesn't burn," said Jean Prevost, a writer and hero of the French Resistance during World War II. "I need three or four cubic feet of new ideas every day, as a steamboat needs coal." Your soul may not be quite as blazing as his, Aries, and you may normally be able to get along fine with just a few cubic inches of new ideas per day. But I expect that in the next three to four weeks, you will both need and yearn to generate Prevost-type levels of heat and light. Please make sure you're getting a steady supply of the necessary fuel.



All of creation loves you very much. Even now, people you know and people you don't know are collaborating to make sure you have all you need to make your next smart move. But are you willing to start loving life back with an equal intensity? The adoration it offers you has not exactly been unrequited, but there is room for you to be more demonstrative. For help in cultivating this approach, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Is there a difference in sound quality between relatively inexpensive modern violins and the multi-million-dollar violins created by master craftsmen in the 1700s? In research done at the Eighth International Violin Competition, most violinists couldn't tell them apart. (Read more here.) In accordance with the astrological omens, Aries, I urge you to do comparable tests in your own sphere. There's no need to overpay for anything, either with your money, your emotions, your energy, or your time. Go with what works, not with what costs the most or has highest status.



No one knows you better than you do, but maybe I can help you dig up even more self-knowledge. Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In one of your past lives, I think you must have periodically done something like stick your tongue out or thumb your nose at pretentious tyrants -- and gotten away with it. At least that's one explanation for how confident you often are about speaking up when everyone else seems unwilling to point out that the emperor is in fact wearing no clothes. This quality should come in handy during the coming week. It may be totally up to you to reveal the truth about an obvious secret or collective delusion. Can you figure out a way to be relatively tactful as you say what supposedly can't or shouldn't be said?



How are you going to change what needs to be changed and accept what needs to be accepted? To get some support from me, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

On the one hand, you're facing a sticky dilemma that you may never be able to change no matter how hard you try. On the other hand, you are engaged with an interesting challenge that may very well be possible to resolve. Do you know which is which? Now would be an excellent time to make sure you do. It would be foolish to keep working on untying a hopelessly twisted knot when there is another puzzle that will respond to your love and intelligence. Go where you're wanted.



What is the obvious secret you can't quite see? How could you turn your challenges into daily gifts for yourself? For clues to mysteries like these, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"True life is lived when tiny changes occur," said Leo Tolstoy. I agree. It's rare for us to undergo rapid, dramatic transformations in short periods of time. That's why it's delusional to be forever pining for some big magic intervention that will fix everything. The best way to alter our course is slowly and gradually, by conscientiously revamping our responses to the small daily details. Keep these thoughts close at hand in the coming weeks, Aries. Be a devotee of the incremental approach. Step-by-step. Hour-by-hour.



Wouldn't you love to learn more about who you really are? What better adventure is there than learning about your soul's code? For more hints, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You had to take the test before you got a chance to study more than a couple of the lessons. Does that seem fair? Hell, no. That's the bad news. The good news is that this test was merely a rehearsal for a more important and inclusive exam, which is still some weeks in the future. Here's even better news: The teachings that you will need to master before then are flowing your way, and will continue to do so in abundance. Apply yourself with diligence, Aries. You have a lot to learn, but luckily, you have enough time to get fully prepared.



Sometimes it's a challenge to try to figure out what's important and what's not important. If you'd like more of my input, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Some people misunderstand the do-it-now fervor of the Aries tribe, thinking it must inevitably lead to carelessness. Please prove them wrong in the coming weeks. Launch into the interesting new possibilities with all your exuberance unfurled. Refuse to allow the natural energy to get hemmed in by theories and concepts. But also be sure not to mistake rash impatience for intuitive guidance. Consider the likelihood that your original vision of the future might need to be tinkered with a bit as you translate it into the concrete details.



Grace emerges in the ebb and flow, not just the flow. The waning reveals a different blessing than the waxing. Where are you in the great cycle of your life? For inspiration in figuring it all out, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Please study this testimony: "Born in a rancid, bat-infested cave at the base of the smoldering Sangay Volcano, I was raised by the half-bear demon princess Arcastia. At the age of four my training as a ninja shaman began when I was left naked and alone next to a stream of burning lava with only two safety pins, a package of dental floss, and a plastic bag full of Cheerios. My mission: to find my way to my spiritual home." Now, Aries, I'd like you to compose your own version of this declaration: a playful, over-the-top myth about your origins that gives you a greater appreciation for the heroic journey you've been on all these years.



I hope the oracle above provides you with the inspiration you need to do what you've got to do and change what needs to be changed. But if you need more clues, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE, where I go further in exploring your mysteries.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A few months after America invaded Iraq in 2003, soldier Brian Wheeler wrote the following to help us imagine what it was like over there: "Go to the worst crime-infested place you can find. Go heavily armed, wearing a flak jacket and a Kevlar helmet. Set up shop in a vacant lot. Announce to the residents that you are there to help them, and in the loudest voice possible yell that every Crip and Blood within hearing distance is a PANSY." As a character-building exercise, Aries, I highly recommend you try something like this yourself. APRIL FOOL! I was just kidding. What I just said is not an accurate reading of the astrological omens. But this is: Get out of your comfort zone, yes, but with a smart gamble, not a crazy risk. 



How well is your imagination working these days? Could it use a boost? A prod? A jolt of inspiration? Try tuning in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Not bad for a few weeks' work, or play, or whatever it is you want to call this tormented, inspired outburst. Would it be too forward of me to suggest that you've gone a long way toward outgrowing the dark fairy tale that had been haunting your dreams for so long? And yet all this may just be a warm-up for your next metamorphosis, in which you make an audacious new commitment to becoming what you really want to be when you grow up.



Whether it's your time to ferment in the shadows or sing in the sun, fresh power to transform yourself is on the way. Life always delivers the creative energy you need to change into the new thing you must become. For more help in understanding it all, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This week you may learn the real reason the tortoise beat the hare, why two of the three blind mice weren't really blind, and the shocking truth about the relationship between Cinderella's fairy godmother and the handsome prince. Myths will be mutating, Aries. Nursery rhymes will scramble and fairy tales will fracture. Thor, the god of thunder, may make a tempting offer to Snow White. The cow's jump over the moon could turn out to have been faked by the CIA. An ugly duckling will lay an egg that Chicken Little claims is irrefutable proof the 2012 Mayan Apocalypse is imminent. Sounds like a rowdy good time for all!



For more help in understanding your relationship with the game of life, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Controlled hysteria is what is required," said playwright Arthur Miller in speaking about his creative process. "To exist constantly in a state of controlled hysteria. It's agony. But everyone has agony. The difference is that I try to take my agony home and teach it to sing." I hope this little outburst inspires you, Aries. It's an excellent time for you to harness your hysteria and instruct your agony in the fine art of singing. To boost your chances of success in pulling off this dicey feat, use every means at your disposal to have fun and stay amused.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

At one point in his book The Divine Comedy, the Italian poet Dante is traveling through purgatory on his way to paradise. American poet T.S. Eliot describes the scene: "The people there were inside the flames expurgating their errors and sins. And there was one incident when Dante was talking to an unknown woman in her flame. As she answered Dante's questions, she had to step out of her flame to talk to him, until at last she was compelled to say to Dante, 'Would you please hurry up with your questions so I can get on with my burning?'" I bring this to your attention, Aries, because I love the way you've been expurgating your own errors and sins lately. Don't let anything interfere with your brilliant work. Keep burning till you're done. (Source: "A New Type of Intellectual: Contemplative Withdrawal and Four Quartets," by Kenneth P. Kramer.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I invite you to identify all the things in your life that you really don't need any more: gadgets that have become outdated, clothes that no longer feel like you, once-exciting music and books and art works that no longer mean what they once did. Don't stop there. Pinpoint the people who have let you down, the places that lower your vitality, and the activities that have become boring or artificial. Finally, Aries, figure out the traditions that no longer move you, the behavior patterns that no longer serve you, and the compulsive thoughts that have a freaky life of their own. Got all that? Dump at least some of them.



I hope the oracle above provides you with the inspiration you need to do what you've got to do and change what needs to be changed. But if you need more clues, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE, where I go further in exploring your mysteries.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What do you typically do just before you fall asleep and right after you wake up? Those rituals are important for your mental health. Without exaggeration, you could say they are sacred times when you're poised in the threshold between the two great dimensions of your life. I'll ask you to give special care and attention to those transitions in the coming week. As much as possible, avoid watching TV or surfing the Internet right up to the moment you turn off the light, and don't leap out of bed the instant an alarm clock detonates. The astrological omens suggest you are primed to receive special revelations, even ringing epiphanies, while in those in-between states.



How well is your imagination working these days? Could it use a boost? A prod? A jolt of inspiration? Try tuning in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Marriage must be a relation either of sympathy or conquest," said author George Eliot. I believe the same is true even about intimate bonds that have not been legally consecrated. Each tends to either be a collaboration of equals who are striving for common goals or else a power struggle in which one party seeks to dominate the other. Which of those two models has characterized your romantic history, Aries? Now is an excellent time to begin working to ensure that the partnership model will predominate for the rest of your long life.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Sad but true: A lot of people seem to be perpetually in a state of wanting what they don't have and not wanting what they actually do have. I'm begging you not to be like that in the coming weeks, Aries. Please? I'll tell you why: More than I've seen in a long time, you will have everything going for you if you want precisely what you do have -- and are not full of longing for what's unavailable. Do you think you can you manage that brilliant trick? If so, you will be amazed by the sublimity of the peace that will settle over you.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The coming week is likely to be abnormally free of worries and frustrations. I'm afraid that means you're not going to have as much right to complain as you usually do. Can you handle that? Or will you feel bereft when faced with the prospect of having so little to grumble about? Just in case, I've compiled a list of fake annoyances for you to draw on. 1. "My iPhone wont light my cigarette." 2. "The next tissue in my tissue box doesn't magically poke out when I take one." 3. "I want some ice cream, but I overstuffed myself at dinner." 4. "I saw a hipster wearing a shirt I donated to the Salvation Army and now I want it back." 5. "I ran out of bottled water and now I have to drink from the tap." 6. "My cat's Facebook profile gets more friend requests than me." 7. "I tried to spread cold butter on my toast and the bread ripped." 8. "I was really comfortable but I thought I could be really really comfortable so I adjusted and now I can't get back to my original level of comfort." 9. "When people tell me I should feel grateful for all I have instead of complaining all the time, I feel guilty."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Macy's ad I saw in the newspaper had a blaring headline: "Find Your Magic 2.0." The items that were being touted to help us discover our upgraded and more deluxe sense of magic were luxurious diamond rings. The cheapest was $2,150. I'm going to try to steer you in another direction in your quest to get in touch with Magic 2.0, Aries. I do believe you are in an excellent position to do just that, but only if you take a decidedly non-materialistic approach. What does your intuition tell you about how to hook up with a higher, wilder version of the primal mojo?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Sanskrit word tapasya is translated as "heat," but in the yogic tradition it means "essential energy." It refers to the practice of managing your life force so that it can be directed to the highest possible purposes, thereby furthering your evolution as a spiritual being. Do you have any techniques for accomplishing that -- either through yoga or any other techniques? This would be a good year to redouble your commitment to that work. In the coming months, the world will just keep increasing its output of trivial, energy-wasting temptations. You'll need to be pretty fierce if you want to continue the work of transforming yourself into the Aries you were born to be: focused, direct, energetic, and full of initiative.



As you plunge into 2012, would you like to clarify your purpose? Are there fantasies playing at the back of your mind that you'd like to bring fully into your awareness? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Live out of your imagination, not your history," says Stephen Covey, author of The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. While that's always true, it will be especially crucial for you to remember in 2012. This is the year you can transcend stale traditions, Taurus -- a time when you can escape your outworn habits, reprogram your conditioned responses, and dissolve old karma. You will be getting unparalleled opportunities to render the past irrelevant. And the key to unlocking all the magic will be your freewheeling yet highly disciplined imagination. Call on it often to show you the way toward the future.



Are you ready to shed your superstitious fears about the future? Would you like to slip into 2012 armed with an influx of confidence and poise? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Comedian Steven Wright says his nephew has HDADD, or High Definition Attention Deficit Disorder. "He can barely pay attention, but when he does it's unbelievably clear." I'm predicting something like that for you in the coming week, Gemini. You will encounter more things that are dull than are interesting, but those few that fascinate you will awaken an intense focus that allows you to see into the heart of reality.



What new influences will be headed your way in 2012? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? How can you make best use of these influences and resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

As I contemplate the most desirable fate you could create for yourself, I'm reminded of a lyric from one of my songs: "We are searching for the answers / so we can destroy them and dream up better questions." Here's what I'm implying by that, Cancerian: This is not the right time for you to push for comprehensive formulas and definitive solutions. Rather, it's a favorable moment to draw up the incisive inquiries that will frame your quest for comprehensive formulas and definitive solutions. That quest is due to begin in two weeks. For now, raise your curiosity levels, intensify your receptivity, and make yourself highly magnetic to core truths.



Do you understand just how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2012? Are you fully aware of just how much access you have to new resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"A writer -- and, I believe, generally all persons -- must think that whatever happens to him or her is a resource," said author Jorge Luis Borges. "All that happens to us, including our humiliations, our misfortunes, our embarrassments, all is given to us as raw material, as clay, so that we may shape our art." I agree that this advice isn't just for writers, but for everyone. And it so happens that you are now in an astrological phase when adopting such an approach would bring you abundant wisdom and provide maximum healing. So get started, Leo: Wander through your memories, reinterpreting the difficult experiences as rich raw material that you can use to beautify your soul and intensify your lust for life.



Would you like some inspiration as you muse and wonder about your upcoming adventures in 2012? Do you long to slip out of your habitual thoughts about your life and get a more transcendent view?

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"Poetry is the kind of thing you have to see from the corner of your eye," said the poet William Stafford. "If you look straight at it you can't see it, but if you look a little to one side it is there." As I contemplate your life in the immediate future, Virgo, I'm convinced that his definition of poetry will be useful for you to apply to just about everything. In fact, I think it's an apt description of all the important phenomena you'll need to know about. Better start practicing your sideways vision.



What hidden factors will be massaging your destiny in 2012? Could you use some hints about how to prepare for the adventures awaiting you in the next 12 months?

Libra (September 23-October 22)

A Swedish man named Richard Handl decided to conduct a scientific experiment in his kitchen. Would it be possible to split atoms using a homemade apparatus? He wanted to see if he could generate atomic reactions with the radioactive elements radium, americium, and uranium. But before he got too far into the process, the police intervened and ended his risky fairy-tale. I bring this to your attention, Libra, as an example of how not to proceed in the coming weeks. It will be a good time for you to experiment around the house -- refining your relationship with your roommates, moving the furniture around, and in general rearranging the domestic chemistry -- but please avoid trying stuff as crazy as Handl's. 



What will be the story of your life in 2012? How can you exert your free will to create the adventures that'll bring out the best in you, even as you find graceful ways to cooperate with the tides of destiny?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In 1878, Thomas Edison perfected the phonograph, a machine that could record sounds and play them back. There had been some primitive prototypes before, but his version was a major improvement. And what were the first sounds to be immortalized on Edison's phonograph? The rush of the wind in the trees? A dramatic reading of the Song of Songs? The cries of a newborn infant? Nope. Edison recited the nursery rhyme, "Mary Had a Little Lamb." When you make your own breakthrough in communication sometime soon, Scorpio, I hope you deliver a more profound and succulent message.



Do you really know how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2012? Probably not. But I'd like to help you know about that power, and tap into it. This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

I suspect you may soon find yourself in a situation similar to the one that 19th-century American President Abraham Lincoln was in when he said the following: "If this is coffee, please bring me some tea. But if this is tea, please bring me some coffee." In other words, Sagittarius, you may not be picky about what you want, but whatever it is, you'll prefer it to be authentic, pure, and distinctly itself. Adulterations and hodgepodges won't satisfy you, and they won't be useful. Hold out for the Real Thing.



What are your plans for the coming year? Could you use some more help mapping out your dreams and schemes?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Last summer, before the football season started, sportswriter Eric Branch wrote about a rookie running back that San Francisco 49er fans were becoming increasingly excited about. The newbie had made some big plays in exhibition games. Would he continue performing at a high level when the regular season began? Were the growing expectations justified? After a careful analysis, Branch concluded that the signs were promising, but not yet definitive: "It's OK to go mildly berserk," he informed the fans. That's the same message I'm delivering to you right now, Capricorn. The early stages of your new possibility are encouraging. It's OK to go mildly berserk, but it's not yet time to go totally bonkers.



Who do you want to become in 2012? Where do you want to go and what do you want to do? I'm ready to help you muse about the interesting possibilities. This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in!

Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In summer, the pickleweed plant thrives in the saltwater marshes around San Francisco Bay. In many places, bright orange patches of the dodder plant intermingle with the pickleweed's sprightly jade green, creating festive displays that suggest nature is having a party. But there's a secret buried in this scene. The dodder's webby filaments are actually parasites that suck nutrients from the pickleweed. In accordance with the astrological omens, Aquarius, I'll ask you if a situation like that exists in your own life. Is there a pretty picture that hides an imbalance in the give-and-take of energy? It's not necessarily a bad thing -- after all, the pickleweed grows abundantly even with its freeloader hanging all over it -- but it's important to be conscious of what's going on.



What new influences will be headed your way in 2012? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? Would you like some guidance as you figure out how to make best use of those influences and resources?

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"That in a person which cannot be domesticated is not his evil but his goodness," said the writer Antonio Porchia. I invite you to keep that challenging thought close to your heart in the coming days, Pisces. In my astrological opinion, it is an excellent moment to tune in to your wildest goodness -- to describe it to yourself, to cherish it as the great treasure it is, to foster it and celebrate it and express it like a spring river overflowing its banks.



How can you conspire with life to create the best possible future for yourself? What well-informed and ingenious approaches can you use to get the most out of the raw materials you're presented with?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"It is surely a great calamity for a human being to have no obsessions," said poet Robert Bly. That's why he decided to learn to love his obsessions. I urge you to keep his approach in mind throughout the coming months, Aries. You are likely to thrive to the degree that you precisely identify and vigorously harness your obsessions. Please note I'm not saying you should allow your obsessions to possess you like demons and toss you around like a rag doll. I'm not advising you to fall down in front of your obsessions and worship them like idols. Be wildly grateful for them; love them with your fiery heart fully unfurled; but keep them under the control of your fine mind.



How can you conspire with life to create the best possible future for yourself? What well-informed and ingenious approaches can you use to get the most out of the raw materials you're presented with?

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Everyone is a genius, but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will spend its whole life believing it is stupid." Rumor has it that this pithy observation was uttered by Albert Einstein. I bring it to your attention, Taurus, because you'll be smart to keep it in mind throughout 2012. According to my astrological analysis, you will have an excellent opportunity to identify and hone and express your specific brilliance. So it is crucial that you eliminate any tendency you might have to see yourself as being like a fish whose job it is to climb a tree.



As you plunge in to 2012, would you like to clarify your purpose? Are there fantasies playing at the back of your mind that you'd like to bring fully into your awareness?

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

In his book Priceless: How I Went Undercover to Rescue the World's Stolen Treasures, former FBI agent Robert K. Wittman tells the story of the world's second largest crystal ball. Worth $350,000 and once belonging to the Chinese Dowager Empress, it was stolen from a museum. Wittman never located the actual robber, but years later he tracked down the crystal ball to a person who had acquired it quite innocently and by accident. She was a young witch in New Jersey who, unaware of its origins or value, kept it on her bedroom dresser with a baseball cap on top of it. I suspect you may have a comparable adventure in the coming months, Gemini. If you look hard and keep an open mind, you will eventually recover lost riches or a disappeared prize in the least likely of places.



Are you ready to shed your superstitious fears about the future? Would you like to slip into 2012 armed with an influx of confidence and poise?

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

It's impossible for the human body to run a mile in less than four minutes -- at least that's what the conventional wisdom used to say. And indeed, no one in history ever broke that barrier until May 6, 1954, when Roger Bannister raced a mile in three minutes, 59.4 seconds. Since then, lots of athletes have done it and the record has been lowered by another 17 seconds. In fact, the sub-four-minute mile is now regarded as a standard accomplishment for middle-distance runners. I suspect that in 2012 you will accomplish your own version of Bannister's feat -- a breakthrough that once seemed crazy difficult or beyond your capacity.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Back in 1958, 17-year-old Bob Heft created a 50-star American flag for a high school project. Hawaii and Alaska were being considered for U.S. statehood at that time, and a new design was needed to replace the old 48-star flag. Heft's teacher originally gave him a grade of B- for his work. But when his model was later selected to be the actual American flag, the teacher raised his grade to an A. I suspect that a similar progression is in store for you in the coming year, Leo. Some work you did that never received proper credit will finally be accorded the value it deserves.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Greek philosopher Plato suggested that we may become more receptive to spiritual beauty by putting ourselves in the presence of physical beauty. The stimulation we get when inspired by what looks good may help train us to recognize sublime truths. I'm not so sure about that. In my experience, people often get so entranced by their emotional and bodily responses to attractive sights and sounds that they neglect to search for higher, subtler sources of splendor. But I do believe you may be an exception to this tendency in the coming months. That's why I'm giving you the go-ahead -- indeed, the mandate -- to surround yourself with physical beauty.



Would you like some inspiration as you muse and wonder about your upcoming adventures in 2012? Do you long to slip out of your habitual thoughts about your life and get a more transcendent view?

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Before he died in 1902, Libran cartoonist Thomas Nast left a potent legacy. Among his enduring creations were the modern image of Santa Claus, the iconic donkey for America's Democratic Party, and the elephant for the Republican Party. I'm guessing that 2012 is going to be a Thomas Nast kind of year for you Librans. The work you do and the ripples you set in motion are likely to last a long time. So I suggest you choose the influences you unleash with great care and integrity.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"If you're in a good relationship, chances are you're bored out of your mind," spouts comedian Chris Rock in his show Never Scared. "All good relationships are boring. The only exciting relationships are bad ones. You never know what's going to happen tomorrow when you're in a bad relationship. You never know when they're gonna walk through the door and say, 'Hey, you gave me crabs.' That's exciting!" Rock is making a satirical overstatement, but it does contain grains of truth. Which is why, in accordance with the astrological omens, I deliver the following request to you: In 2012, cultivate stable relationships that are boring in all the best ways.



What will be the story of your life in 2012?

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Once every decade or so, you're asked to make a special point of practicing forgiveness and atonement. According to my reading of the astrological omens, that time will be the next few months. I think it'll be quite important for you to cleanse the grungy build-up of regrets and remorse from your psyche. Ready to get started? Compose a list of the sins you could expiate, the karmic debts you can repay, and the redemptions you should initiate. I suggest you make it into a fun, creative project that you will thoroughly enjoy.



Do you really know how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2012? Probably not. But I'd like to help you know about that power, and tap into it.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Happiness isn't a state you acquire by luck. It takes hard work and relentless concentration. You have to rise up and rebel against the nonstop flood of trivial chaos and meaningless events you're invited to wallow in. You have to overcome the hard-core cultural conditioning that tempts you to assume that suffering is normal and the world is a hostile place. It's really quite unnatural to train yourself to be peaceful and mindful; it's essentially a great rebellion against an unacknowledged taboo. Here's the good news: 2012 will be an excellent time for you to do this work.



What are your plans for the coming year? Could you use some more help mapping out your dreams and schemes?

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

More and more musicians and authors are choosing to self-publish. That way they retain the full rights to their creative work, keeping it from being controlled and potentially misused by a record label or publishing company. One example is singer-songwriter Terri Hendrix, who owns all 14 of her master recordings. She lives by the motto, "Own Your Own Universe." I urge you to adopt her approach in 2012, Aquarius. The coming months will be prime time for you to do all you can to take full possession of everything you need to become what you want to be.



Who do you want to become in 2012? Where do you want to go and what do you want to do? I'm ready to help you muse about the interesting possibilities. This week and next week, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 2 and Part 3 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The coming months will be a time when you'll thrive by seeking out novel ideas, using new words, and regarding your imagination as an organ that's as important to feed as your stomach. In that spirit, I'm offering you a slew of freshly made-up terms that'll help tease your brain in ways that are in alignment with the upcoming astrological factors. They all come from a very NSFW dictionary. 1. Assymectricity: energy generated by lopsidedness. 2. Enigmagnetic: a person who attracts mysteries. 3. Indumbnitable: incapable of being dumbed down. 4. Beneviolent: helpful chaos. 5. Fauxbia: a fake fear. 6. Craptometry: ability to see through all the BS. 7. Adoregasm: when you treasure someone to the point of ecstasy.



What new influences will be headed your way in 2012? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? Would you like some guidance as you figure out how to make best use of those influences and resources? This week and next week, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 2 and Part 3 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In North America, a farmer who grows wheat gets only five percent of the money earned by selling a loaf of bread made from his crop. When my band recorded an album for MCA, our contract called for us to receive just seven percent of the net profits. I encourage you to push for a much bigger share than that for the work you do in 2012. It will be an excellent time to raise the levels of respect you have for your own gifts, skills, and products -- and to ask for that increased respect, as well.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

For much of the 19th century, aluminum was regarded as a precious metal more valuable than gold. It was even used for the capstone of the Washington Monument, dedicated in 1884. The reason for this curiosity? Until the 1890s, it was difficult and expensive to extract aluminum from its ore. Then a new technology was developed that made the process very cheap. In 2012, Taurus, I'm predicting a metaphorically similar progression in your own life. A goodie or an asset will become more freely available to you because of your increased ability to separate it from the slag it's mixed with.



How can you conspire with life to create the best possible future for yourself? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in! Start dreaming and scheming about what's possible for you in the coming months.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

The coming year will be a good time for you to consider investigating the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Devotees of this religion call themselves Pastafarians. Their main dogma is the wisdom of rejecting all dogma. Having such a light-hearted approach to spiritual matters would be quite healthy for you to experiment with. For extra credit, you could draw inspiration from a church member named Niko Alm. He convinced authorities to allow him to wear a pasta strainer on his head for his driver's license photo. Having a jaunty  approach to official requirements and formal necessities will also serve you well.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Terrence Malick's Tree of Life is an ambitious work that deviates from formulaic approaches to film-making. Some observers hated its experimental invocation of big ideas, while others approved. New York Times critic A.O. Scott compared the movie to Herman Melville's Moby Dick, one of America's great works of literature. Here's what Scott wrote: "Mr. Malick might have been well advised to leave out the dinosaurs and the trip to the afterlife and given us a delicate chronicle of a young man's struggle with his father and himself. And perhaps Melville should have suppressed his philosophizing impulses and written a lively tale of a whaling voyage." Using this as a template, Cancerian, I urge you to treat 2012 as a time when you will be like Melville and Malick in your chosen field. Trust your daring, expansive vision.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I love the way they celebrate the New Year in Stonehaven, Scotland. A procession of revelers swings big flaming baskets around on the ends of long chains. I recommend that you carry out a comparable ritual as you barge into 2012, Leo. Symbolically speaking, it would set the perfect tone. The coming months should be a kind of extended fire festival for you -- a time when you faithfully stoke the blaze in your belly, the radiance in your eyes, and the brilliance in your heart. Are you ready to bring all the heat and light you can to the next phase of your master plan? I hope so. Burn, baby, burn.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Historian David McCullough wrote The Greater Journey, a book telling the stories of ambitious young American artists who relocated to Paris between 1830 and 1900. They had to move away because their home country had no museums or art schools at that time. You Virgos may want to consider seeking a similar enlargement of your possibilities in the coming months. As you seek out the resources that will help you follow your dreams, be prepared to look beyond what you already know and what's immediately available.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Professional basketball player Ron Artest petitioned the court to let him change his name to "Metta World Peace." "Metta" is a Buddhist term that signifies loving-kindness and benevolence. When the new moniker finally became official, Metta World Peace sealed a radical shift away from his old way of doing things, symbolized by the time he leaped into the stands in the middle of a game to punch a fan in the head. The coming months will be an excellent time for you Libras to initiate a rite of passage that will expedite an equally dramatic transformation.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Many of the questions we had as children never got resolved or answered to our satisfaction. They still remain marinating in the back of our minds. Meanwhile, fresh queries keep welling up within us as the years go by. After a while, we've got a huge collection of enigmas, riddles, and conundrums. Some of us regard this as a tangled problem that weighs us down, while others see it as a sparkly delight that keeps making life more and more interesting. Where do you stand on the issue, Scorpio? If you're in the latter group, you will be fully open to the experiences that will be flowing your way in 2012. And that means you will be blessed with a host of sumptuous and catalytic new questions.



What hidden factors will be massaging your destiny in 2012? Could you use some hints about how to prepare for the adventures awaiting you in the next eight to twelve months? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in!

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

The first half of 2012 will be an excellent time to for you to exorcize any prejudices you might be harboring toward anyone who lives or thinks differently from you. You'll be able to see your own irrational biases with exceptional clarity, and are also likely to have exceptional success at scouring yourself free of them. This will give you access to new reserves of psychic energy you didn't even realize you were shut off from. (P.S. I'm not saying you possess more intolerance or narrow-mindedness than any of the rest of us. It's just that this is your time to deal brilliantly with your share of it.)



What will be the story of your life in 2012? How can you exert your free will to create the adventures that'll bring out the best in you, even as you find graceful ways to cooperate with the tides of destiny? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2012. Tune in!

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus, the goddess of beauty and love is shown arriving on dry land for the first time after having been born in the ocean. Naked, she is trying to cover her private parts with her hand and thigh-length hair. Her attendant, a fully clothed nymph, is bringing a cloak to cover her up. Analyzing this scene, art critic Sister Wendy suggests it's actually quite sad. It symbolizes the fact that since we humans can't bear the confrontation with sublime beauty, we must always keep it partly hidden. Your assignment in the coming year, Capricorn, is to overcome this inhibition. I invite you to retrain yourself so that you can thrive in the presence of intense, amazing, and transformative beauty.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

The coming months will be an excellent time to take an inventory of your life to determine whether there are any ways in which you act like a slave. Do you find it hard to defeat an addiction that saps your energy and weakens your ability to live the life you want? Are there institutions that you help sustain even though they cause harm to you and others? Is it hard for you to change or end your relationships with people who are no damn good for you? Are you trapped in a role or behavior that is at odds with your high ideals? Discover what these oppressors are, Aquarius -- and then summon all your intelligence and willpower to escape them.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

California engineer Ron Patrick put a jet engine in his silver VW Beetle. Now he's got a 1,450-horsepower vehicle -- but it's not legal for him to drive on public highways. In the coming year, Pisces, I suspect you'll be tempted to try something similar: create a dynamic tool with a modest appearance or a turbo-charged source of energy in a deceptively small package. But if you do, please make sure that you can actually use it to improve your ability to get around and make your life better.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the fictional world of the wizard Harry Potter, muggles are people who have no magical powers. Because of their deficiency, certain sights may be literally invisible to them, and certain places inaccessible. I'm going to boldly predict that you Aries people will lose at least some of your muggleness in the coming year. A part of your life where you've been inept or clueless will begin to wake up. In ways that may feel surprisingly easy, you'll be able to fill a gap in your skill set or knowledge base.



This week my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES offer you a teaser look at some of the major themes you will be working and playing with in 2012. Then, beginning December 27, I will devote three consecutive weeks of EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES to an in-depth discussion of your long-range outlook for the coming months. Tune in!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Jim Moran (1908-1999) called himself a publicist, but I regard him as a pioneer performance artist. At various times in his colorful career, he led a bull through a china shop in New York City, changed horses in midstream in Nevada's Truckee River, and looked for a needle in a haystack until he found it. You might want to draw inspiration from his work in the coming weeks, Aries. You will not only have a knack for mutating cliches and scrambling conventional wisdom. In doing so, you could also pull off feats that might seem improbable.



What is the obvious secret you can't quite see? How could you turn your challenges into daily gifts for yourself? For clues to mysteries like these, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen in your life? To answer that question is your first assignment. It's OK if you can't decide between the three or four most beautiful things. What's important is to keep visions of those amazements dancing in the back of your mind for the next few days. Play with them in your imagination. Feel the feelings they rouse in you as you muse about the delights they have given you. Regard them as beacons that will attract other ravishing marvels into your sphere. Now here's your second assignment: Be alert for and go hunting for a new "most beautiful thing."



Wouldn't you love to learn more about who you really are? What better adventure is there than learning about your soul's code? For more hints, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This would be an excellent week to head down to Pucon, Chile and hire a daredevil to fly you in a helicopter into the caldera of the active Villarrica volcano, whereupon you would bungee-jump out of the copter down to within 700 feet of the molten lava. If that's too extreme or expensive for your tastes, I urge you to come up a milder adventure that will still bring you a close encounter with primal heat and light -- and maybe even some divine fire.



Sometimes it's a challenge to try to figure out what's important and what's not important. If you'd like more of my input, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Basic research is what I am doing when I don't know what I am doing," said rocket scientist Werner von Braun. I think it's an excellent time for you to plunge into that kind of basic research, Aries. You're overdue to wander around frontiers you didn't even realize you needed to investigate. You're ready to soak up insights from outside the boundaries of your understanding. In fact, I think it's your sacred duty to expose yourself to raw truths and unexpected vistas that have been beyond your imagination's power to envision.



All of creation loves you very much. Even now, people you know and people you don't know are collaborating to make sure you have all you need to make your next smart move. But are you willing to start loving life back with an equal intensity? The adoration it offers you has not exactly been unrequited, but there is room for you to be more demonstrative. For help in cultivating this approach, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you go into a major art museum that displays Europe's great oil paintings, you'll find that virtually every masterpiece is surrounded by an ornate wooden frame, often painted gold. Why? To me, the enclosure is distracting and unnecessary. Why can't I just enjoy the arresting composition on the naked canvas, unburdened by the overwrought excess? I urge you to take my approach in the coming weeks, Aries. Push and even fight to get the goodies exactly as they are, free of all the irrelevant filler, extraneous buffers, and pretentious puffery.



No one knows you better than you do, but maybe I can help you dig up even more self-knowledge. Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The title of this week's movie is "Uproar of Love," starring the Fantasy Kid and The Most Feeling Machine In The World. It blends romance and science fiction, with overtones of espionage and undertones of revolution for the hell of it. Comic touches will slip in at unexpected moments. When you're not up to your jowls in archetypes, you might be able to muster the clarity to gorge yourself on the earthly delights that are spread from here to the edge of the abyss.



How are you going to change what needs to be changed and accept what needs to be accepted? To get some support from me, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Here's Malcolm Gladwell, writing in The Tipping Point: "We need to prepare ourselves for the possibility that sometimes big changes follow from small events, and that sometimes these changes can happen quickly . . . Look at the world around you. It may seem an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push -- in just the right place -- it can be tipped." You are now within shouting distance of your own personal tipping point, Aries. Follow your gut wisdom as you decide where to give a firm little push.



I invite you to keep a running list of all the ways life delights you and helps you and energizes you. Describe everyday miracles you take for granted . . . the uncanny powers you possess . . . the small joys that occur so routinely you forget how much they mean to you . . . the steady flow of benefits bestowed on you by people you know and don't know. What works for you? What makes you feel at home in the world? For inspiration in this noble effort, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Life is not just a diurnal property of large interesting vertebrates," poet Gary Snyder reminds us in his book The Practice of the Wild. "It is also nocturnal, anaerobic, microscopic, digestive, fermentative: cooking away in the warm dark." I call this to your attention, Aries, because according to my astrological reckoning, you'd be wise to honor all the life that is cooking away in the warm dark. It's the sun-at-midnight time of your long-term cycle; the phase when your luminescent soul throbs with more vitality than your shiny ego. Celebrate the unseen powers that sustain the world. Pay reverence to what's underneath, elusive, and uncanny. Halloween costume tips: Draw inspiration from the shadow, the dream, the moon, the depths.



Need more help deciphering the riddles and enigmas that are fueling your amazing story? Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you have been resisting the command to go deeper, now is the time to surrender. If you have been hoping that the pesky little voice in your head will shut up and stop bugging you to get more involved, you'd better stop hoping. If you've been fantasizing about how to escape the growing pressure to give more of yourself, I suggest that instead you fantasize about how you could intensify your commitments. The time has come to explore what has been missing and what needs more love.



You're got more strength and intelligence than you realize. For help in accessing those untapped inner resources, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If it's at all possible, Aries, don't hang around boring people this week. Seek out the company of adventurers who keep you guessing and unruly talkers who incite your imagination and mystery-lovers who are always on the lookout for new learning experiences. For that matter, treat yourself to especially interesting food, perceptions, and sensations. Take new and different routes to familiar hotspots. Even better, find fresh hotspots. Cultivating novelty is your mandate right now. Outgrowing your habits would be wise, fun, and cool. Changing your mind is a luxury you need and deserve.



"Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show." So begins Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield. I'd like to inspire you to write a story of your own that begins like that. For help, tune into your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Do unto others as they wish," advised French artist Marcel Duchamp, "but with imagination." I recommend that approach to you, Aries. You're in a phase of your astrological cycle when you can create good fortune for yourself by tuning into the needs and cravings of others, and then satisfying those needs and cravings in your own inimitable and unpredictable ways. Don't just give the people you care about the mirror image of what they ask for; give them a funhouse mirror image that reflects your playful tinkering.



Would you like to hear me say some more about your ever-evolving destiny? Check out your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I've got a challenging assignment for you. In accordance with your current astrological omens, I am inviting you to cultivate a special kind of receptivity -- a rigorously innocent openness to experience that will allow you to be penetrated by life's beauty with sublime intensity. To understand the exact nature of this receptivity, study Abraham Maslow's definition of real listening: to listen "without presupposing, classifying, improving, controverting, evaluating, approving or disapproving, without dueling what is being said, without rehearsing the rebuttal in advance, without free-associating to portions of what is being said so that succeeding portions are not heard at all." 



Want to explore this chapter of your life story even further? Dig deeper? Push harder? Consider tuning in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"I have a simple philosophy," said Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a self-described hedonist who lived till the age of 96. "Fill what's empty. Empty what's full. Scratch where it itches." That's not an approach I recommend you pursue all the time, Aries, but I think it could be both wise and fun for you to do so in the coming weeks. Given the upcoming astrological omens, you have a mandate to find out where the most interesting action is, and dive in with the intent to generate even more action. The catalysts need another catalyst like you.



Assume that your drive to experience pleasure isn't a barrier to your spiritual growth, but is in fact essential to it. Proceed on the hypothesis that cultivating joy can make you a more ethical and compassionate person. Imagine that feeling good has something important to teach you every day. For inspiration in practicing this approach, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"An awakened Aries would rather err on the side of making a daring, improvisational mistake than cuddle up with passionless peace," writes astrologer Hunter Reynolds. "He or she knows that creative conflict can be a greater unifying force than superficial harmony." This is an excellent keynote for you to keep in mind during the coming days. But make sure your motivations are pure and humble, please. If the daring improvisation you launch is fueled by arrogance or the urge to dominate, your efforts to shake things up for the greater good will fail. Fight against what Reynolds calls "terrified niceness" -- but do it with fierce compassion, not sneering rage.



Where do you want to go? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Don't be angry with the rain," counseled author Vladimir Nabokov. "It simply does not know how to fall upward." In the coming week, I advise you to apply that principle to a host of phenomena, Aries. Don't get all knotted up about any force of nature that insists on being itself, and don't waste your time trying to figure out how to disobey the law of gravity. It's fine if you find it amusing to go against the flow, but don't expect the flow to follow you in your rebellion. 



What fresh blessings will life bring you? What questions should you be asking? To explore the ripening trends further, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Strange but true: To pave the way for your next liberation, you will have to impose some creative limitation on yourself. In other words, there's some trivial extravagance or unproductive excess in your current rhythm that is suppressing an interesting form of freedom. As soon as you cut away the faux "luxury" that is holding you back, all of life will conspire to give you a growth spurt.



How's your fight for freedom going? Are you making progress in liberating yourself from your unconscious obsessions, bad habits, and conditioned responses? For assistance and inspiration, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I predict that in the coming weeks, you will be able to extract an unexpected perk or benefit from one of your less glamorous responsibilities. I also predict that you will decide not to ram headfirst into an obstacle and try to batter it until it crumbles. Instead, you'll dream up a roundabout approach that will turn out to be more effective at eliminating the obstacle. Finally, I predict that these departures from habit will show you precious secrets about how to escape more of your own negative conditioning in the future.



Need more whacks applied to your mental blocks? More caresses bestowed upon your growing edge? Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19)
Time magazine asked Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough why he started writing a biography of Pablo Picasso but never finished it. McCullough said it was because the famous artist turned out to be boring. He attracted a steady flow of new lovers, and he made hundreds of paintings, but he didn't actually live an interesting life. I'm urging you to be the anti-Picasso in the coming weeks, Aries. Put the emphasis on the quality of your adventures more than on what you produce. Regard your life as your most important work of art.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Dr. Larry Dossey thinks we shouldn't just automatically dismiss the voices that speak to us in the privacy of our own heads. Some of them may actually have wise counsel, or at least interesting evidence about the state of our inner world. Besides, says Dossey, "it is vital for our mental health to keep the channels open, because when the voices of the gods are shut out, the devils often take up residence." This would be good advice for you to observe in the coming days, Aries. Don't let the nagging, blustering, or unhinged murmurs in your head drown out the still, small voice of lucid intuition. (Dossey's book is The Extraordinary Healing Power of Ordinary Things: Fourteen Natural Steps.)



Take inventory of the extent that "No" dominates your life. Notice how often you say or think: 1. "That's not right." 2. "I don't like that." 3. "I don't agree with that." 4. "They don't like me." 5. "I'm not very good." 6. "That should be different from what it is." For help in retraining yourself to say "Yes!" at least 51% of the time, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Symbolically speaking, there is a Holy Grail hidden close to you, and you know it, but you haven't been able to find it. The Grail is a golden chalice filled with medicine that could open what needs opening in you. Luckily, you will soon come into possession (symbolically speaking) of a big, thick magical wand that can give you a new advantage. Here's what I conclude: Use your wizard stick to locate the cup of wonder so you can take a big sip.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I love how the poet Rachel Loden describes her impressions of Daniel Borzutzky's The Book of Interfering Bodies. She says that reading it is like "chancing upon a secret lake full of trembling lilies that projectile vomit both poems and petroleum." I call this imaginary scene to your attention, Aries, because I'm wondering if you might encounter a metaphorically similar landscape in the coming week. The astrological omens suggest that you're attracted to that kind of strange beauty, surreal intensity, and tenderness mixed with ferocity.



Do you want further explorations of the intriguing twists and turns of your personal evolution? Would you like help in solving the riddles that confuse you? Check out your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I dreamed you were in a cake store. Every delicious kind of cake you could imagine was there: carrot cake, strawberry cheesecake, gooey butter cake, rich chocolate cake with four layers of cherries and whipped cream, birthday cakes that must have been baked in paradise. Sadly, there was a problem: You weren't allowed to buy anything, even though you had enough money. A big sign on the wall said, simply, "Absolutely no cakes available for Aries." What do you think my dream means? More importantly, what are you going to do about the situation? I suggest that in my next dream, you get a friend to buy a cake for you. Either that, or go to a different cake store. One way or another, the astrological omens say it's high time for you get the cake you want.



Seven months ago, I provided several horoscopes that previewed the coming year for you. Would you like to check back with them now? Want to see whether they're relevant to the way your destiny has been evolving these past seven months? You can also still hear my AUDIO PREVIEW of YOUR DESTINY for the REST of 2011 or a short-term forecast for the coming week. Sign up and/or log in here, then click on "Long-Term Forecast for Second Half of 2011" or "This week (July 19, 2011)."


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the coming days you have permission from the universe to dwell less on what needs to be resisted, protested, flushed out, and overcome. Instead you have license to concentrate on what deserves to be fostered, encouraged, bolstered, and invited in. Sound like fun? It will be if you can do it, but it may not be as easy to accomplish as it sounds. There are many influences around you that are tempting you to draw your energy from knee-jerk oppositionalism and cynical naysaying. So in order to take full advantage of what life is offering you, you will have to figure out how to rebel in a spirit of joy and celebration. 



Take inventory of the extent that "No" dominates your life. Notice how often you say or think: 1. "That's not right." 2. "I don't like that." 3. "I don't agree with that." 4. "They don't like me." 5. "I'm not very good." 6. "That should be different from what it is." For help in retraining yourself to say "Yes!" at least 51% of the time, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the coming week. You can also still hear your long-term preview for the rest of 2011. Get exhilarated!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's my observation that women find it easier than men to tune into their natural rhythms. The menstrual cycle helps cultivate that ability. We men experience less dramatic physical shifts, and that seems to give us license to override messages from our bodies for the sake of ambition, laziness, or convenience. Having acknowledged that, I must say that I know men who are highly sensitive and responsive to somatic cues, and women who aren't. Whatever gender you are, I believe that in the coming weeks it's crucial for you to be acutely aware of what's going on inside your beloved flesh-and-blood vehicle. This is one time when you need to be intimately aligned with its needs.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When astronaut Buzz Aldrin flew to the moon and back on the spacecraft Apollo 11 in 1969, he was paid less than $8 a day. That has to stand as one of the most flagrant cases of underpaid labor ever -- far worse than what you've had to endure in your storied career. I suggest you keep Aldrin's story in mind during the next six months as you meditate steadily on the future of your relationship with making money. Hopefully it will help keep you in an amused and spacious and philosophical frame of mind -- which is the best possible attitude to have as you scheme and dream about your financial master plan for the years ahead.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Golden orb spiders of Madagascar spin robust webs. Their silk is stronger than steel yet able to bend and expand when struck by insects. Here's an equally amazing facet of their work: Each morning they eat what remains of yesterday's web and spend an hour or so weaving a fresh one. I'm thinking that your task in the coming weeks has some similarities to the orb spider's, Aries: creating rugged but flexible structures to gather what you need, and being ready to continually shed what has outlived its usefulness so as to build what your changing circumstances require. (Thanks to the California Academy of Sciences for the info on orb spiders.)

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The year is almost half over, Taurus. Shall we sum up the first part of 2011 and speculate about the adventures that may lie ahead of you in the next six months? The way I see it, you've been going through a boisterous process of purification since last January. Some of it has rattled your soul's bones, while some of it has freed you from your mind-forged manacles. In a few short months, you have overseen more climaxes and shed more emotional baggage than you had in the past three years combined. Now you're all clean and clear and fresh, and ready for a less exhausting, more cheerful kind of fun.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Advertisements are often designed to make you feel inadequate about the life you're actually living so you will be motivated to "improve" your lot by buying what they're selling. In this short horoscope, I don't have room to express how much soul sickness this wreaks upon us all. Recently HBO unleashed an especially nefarious attack. Promoting its new streaming service, it informed us that "The story you could be watching is better than the one you're in." Fortunately, Gemini, you won't be tempted to swallow that vicious propaganda anytime in the coming weeks. Your personal story will be profoundly more interesting and meaningful than the narratives that HBO or any other entertainment source might offer.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

A company that manufactures processed food made a promotional offer: If you purchased ten of its products, it would give you 500 frequent flyer miles. An American man named David Philips took maximum advantage. He bought 12,150 pudding cups for $3,000, earning himself more than a million frequent flyer miles -- enough to fly to Europe and back 31 times. This is the kind of legal trick you're now in a good position to pull off, Cancerian. So brainstorm freely, please: How could you play the system, outwit the matrix, rage against the machine, or subvert the Man? No need to break any laws; the best gambit will be an ethical one.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

While watching fast-talking politicians talk on TV, my Polish grand-uncle would sometimes mutter, Zlotem pisal, a gownem zapieczetowal. I only learned what those words meant when I turned 18 and he decided I was old enough to know the translation: "written in gold and sealed with crap." One of your interesting assignments in the coming weeks, Leo, will be to identify anything that fits that description in your own life. Once you've done that, you can get started on the next task, which should be rather fun: Expose the discrepancy, and clean up the mess.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Years ago I did a book tour that brought me to Eugene, Oregon, where my sister and her husband and their daughter live. They came to my reading at a bookstore. My Virgo niece Jasper was seven years old at the time. I was surprised and delighted when she heckled me several times during my talk, always with funny and good-natured comments that added to the conviviality of the moment and entertained everyone in attendance. Who said Virgos are well-behaved to a fault? Your assignment this week is to be inspired by my niece: With wit and compassion, disrupt the orderly flow of any events that could use some smart agitation.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Life is like playing a violin in public and learning the instrument as one goes on," wrote author Samuel Butler. Ain't that the truth! You may be practicing as diligently as you can, gradually trying to master your complex instrument, but in the meantime your lack of expertise is plainly visible to anyone who's paying close attention. Luckily, not too many people pay really close attention, which gives you a significant amount of slack. Now and then, too, you have growth spurts -- phases when your skills suddenly leap to a higher octave. The coming weeks should be one of these times for you, Libra.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In August and September, millions of seabirds known as Sooty Shearwaters leave their homes in New Zealand and travel thousands of miles to the Gulf of the Farallones, just off the coast of San Francisco. Why do they do it? The feeding is first-class; the tasty fish and squid they like are available in abundance. I suggest you consider a Sooty Shearwater-type quest in the coming weeks, Scorpio. The very best samples of the goodies you crave are located at a distance, either in a literal or metaphorical sense.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

I really thought I'd understand sex better by now. After all these years of doing it and studying it and thinking about it and talking about it, I still can't regard myself as a master of the subject. The kundalini's uncanny behavior continues to surprise me, perplex me, and thrill me with ever-new revelations. Just when I imagine I've figured out how it all works, I'm delivered to some fresh mystery. How about you, Sagittarius? Judging by the current astrological omens, I'm guessing you're due for a round of novel revelations about the nature of eros. As long as you keep an open mind, open heart, and open libido, it should all be pretty interesting.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

A few years ago, Eve Ensler took her famous play "The Vagina Monologues" to Pakistan. She and a group of local Muslim actresses wowed a crowd in Islamabad with discourses on vibrators, menstruation, and "triple orgasms." I invite and encourage you to try something equally brave in the coming weeks, Capricorn. Give your spiel to a new audience; take your shtick to a wild frontier; show who you really are to important people who don't know the truth yet.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

When my "macho feminist" memoir The Televisionary Oracle was published in 2000, I suffered from comical delusions about its chances for mainstream acceptance. For example, I tried to get a review in The New York Times. As I know now, that had as much likelihood of happening as me traveling to the moon in a rainbow canoe carried by magical flying mermaids. But in lieu of that kind of recognition, others arrived. One of my favorites: My book went along for the ride with a group of American goddess-worshipers on a spiritual tour to the ancient matriarchal city of Catal Huyuk in Turkey. They read my writing aloud to each other, amused and entertained. I suspect you will soon have a similar experience, Aquarius: having to "settle for" a soulful acknowledgment that's different from what your ego thought it wanted. Take it from me: That's actually better.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

My favorite plant food for my African violets is a natural fertilizer called Big Bloom. One of its key ingredients -- the stuff that makes it so effective -- is bat guano. I'd like to suggest that you're about due to embark on the Big Blooming phase of your own cycle, Pisces. And it's more likely to reach its deserved pinnacle of fertility if you're willing to summon just a hint of bat-sh** craziness from the depths of your subconscious mind. But remember: just a dollop, not a giant heap.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The film Tuck Everlasting tells the story of a family that becomes immortal after drinking from a magical spring. The two parents and their two sons hide their gift from the world, but eventually a mysterious man in a yellow suit finds out about their secret and stalks them. At one point in his search, this man has a conversation with a young pastor. "What if you could be eternal?" he asks the priest. "Without having to face the uncertainty of death. Invincible to disease. Forever young." The priest is rattled. "You speak blasphemy, sir," he protests. "Fluently," replies the man in the yellow suit. You have that mandate right now Aries: to speak blasphemy fluently, as well as any other rebellious diction. It's time to rise up and express the unspeakable, the controversial, the revolutionary.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You have a poetic license, as well as astrological permission, to be extra cute in the coming week. I mean you have a divine mandate to exceed the usual levels of being adorable and charming and delectable. Here's the potential problem with that, though: Trying to be cute doesn't usually result in becoming cuter; often it leads to being smarmy and pretentious. So how can you take advantage of the cosmic imperative to be wildly, extravagantly, sublimely cute -- without getting all self-conscious about it? That's your riddle of the week.



Somewhere there's a treasure that has no value to anyone but you, and a secret that's meaningless to everyone except you, and a frontier that harbors a revelation only you would know how to exploit. Why not go in search of those things? For inspiration, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The film The Men Who Stare at Goats tells the story of the U.S. army's efforts to harness psychic powers for military purposes. It's not entirely a work of the imagination. In fact, there's substantial evidence that such a program actually existed. As the movie begins, a caption on the screen informs viewers that "More of this is true than you would believe." I suspect there'll be a comparable situation unfolding in your life in the coming weeks, Aries. As you experience a rather unusual departure from your regularly scheduled reality, fact and fiction may be deeply intertwined. Will you be able to tell them apart?



In addition to these love letters I write for you, I offer EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES. They're designed to help you go further in exploring the mysteries of your strange and wonderful life.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Weaseling out of things is important to learn," said cartoon anti-hero Homer Simpson. "It's what separates us from the animals -- except the weasel." I normally don't share that sentiment. My standard advice is to face up to challenging situations and take responsibility for the part you played in creating them. But I'm going to rebel against my custom this week and endorse Homer's approach, Aries. You may be on the verge of getting sucked into a mess that you had virtually no role in creating. Either that, or you'll be asked to carry out a mission that is irrelevant to your long-term goals. In either case, you have cosmic permission to weasel out.



Do you wish you could get more clarity about the foggy, ambiguous situations you're dealing with? Want more help in exploring the Great Mystery that is your life? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Today I received this email: "Dear Chosen One: My name is Boopsky, also known as 'The Impossible.' I rule a small kingdom that exists in a secret place -- an island with abundant riches and rhinoceros playgrounds. To make a long story short, you have won our 'naked' lottery. Please come visit us to claim your prizes. We will carve a statue of you out of butter and strawberry jam. Your funny ways of walking and talking will be imitated by all of our citizens. Then you will be caressed as a monarch on a pile of TVs and sung songs to by our reincarnation chorus. Can't wait to see you be so happy!" I suspect you may soon receive an invitation as puzzling as this one, Aries -- an apparent blessing that carries mixed messages or odd undertones. My suggestion is to hold off on accepting it until you find out more about it. Meanwhile, make sure it doesn't distract you from taking advantage of a less flashy but more practical opportunity.



What exactly are you looking for? How would you describe the experiences you want more than anything else? It's possible my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE could give you additional help in figuring that out.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The 16th-century English writer John Heywood was a prolific creator of epigrams. I know of at least 20 of his proverbs that are still invoked, including "Haste makes waste," "Out of sight, out of mind," "Look before you leap," "Beggars shouldn't be choosers," "Rome wasn't built in a day," and "Do you want to both eat your cake and have it, too?" I bring this up, Aries, because I suspect you're in a Heywoodian phase of your long-term cycle. In the coming weeks, you're likely to unearth a wealth of pithy insights and guiding principles that will serve you well into the future.



You can learn to be lucky. It's not a mystical force you're born with, but a habit you can develop. How? For starters, be open to new experiences, trust your gut wisdom, expect good fortune, see the bright side of challenging events, and master the art of maximizing serendipitous opportunities. For more help, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Imagine this scene, as described by Seattle-based video artist Michael Douglas. "Sometimes a tree falls down in a field of cows, and the cows walk over to it and stare at it. It used to be standing and now it's on the ground. There's something different in the field and the cows start to hang out around the tree and watch it like it's television, attracted to the rupture in the order of things. They gather around it for months, even after they completely forget why they started doing it." I think there's a comparable scene going on in your life right now, Aries. People you care about are in a daze, seemingly hypnotized by a certain "rupture in the order of things" that took place some time ago. In my opinion, it's your task to wake them up, gently if possible, and motivate them to move on.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To convey my vision of how best to proceed in the coming week, I'll offer the following metaphorical scenario: Imagine that you are not a professional chef, but you do have a modicum of cooking skills. Your task is to create a hearty, tasty soup from scratch without the benefit of a recipe. You will need a variety of ingredients, but on the other hand you don't want to just throw in a welter of mismatched ingredients without regard for how they will all work together. To some degree you will have to use a trial-and-error approach, sampling the concoction as it brews. You will also want to keep an open mind about the possibility of adding new ingredients in the latter stages of the process. One more thing: The final product must not just appeal to you. You should keep in mind what others would like, too.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Now comes one of the supreme tests that most every Aries must periodically face: Will you live up to your promises? Will you follow through on your rousing start? Will you continue to stay passionately committed once the fiery infatuation stage evolves into the earthy foundation-building stage? Here's a secret to succeeding at this test: You can't just try to force yourself to "be good" and do the right thing. Nor does it work to use shame or guilt to motivate yourself. Somehow you've got to marshal pure, raw excitement for the gritty detail work to come. You've got to fall in love with the task of actually fleshing out your dreams.

In her blog, Jane at janebook.tumblr.com answers questions from readers. A recent query went like this: "Who would win in a steel cage match, Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?" Jane said, "Easter Bunny, no question; he has those big-ass teeth." But I'm not so sure. My sources say that Santa has more raw wizardry at his disposal than the Bunny. His magical prowess would most likely neutralize the Bunny's superior physical assets. Likewise, Aries, I'm guessing you will have a similar edge in upcoming steel cage matches -- or any other competitions in which you're involved. These days you've simply got too much mojo to be defeated.

When he was three years old, actor Charlie Sheen got a hernia from yelling too much and too loud. I definitely don't encourage you to be like that. However, I do think it's an excellent time to tune in to the extravagant emotions that first made an appearance when you were very young and that have continued to be a source of light and heat for you ever since. Maybe righteous anger is one of those vitalizing emotions, but there must be others as well -- crazy longing, ferocious joy, insatiable curiosity, primal laughter. Get in touch with them; invite them to make an appearance and reveal the specific magic they have to give you right now.



Somewhere there's a treasure that has no value to anyone but you, and a secret that's meaningless to everyone except you, and a frontier that harbors a revelation only you would know how to exploit. Why not go in search of those things? For inspiration, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This is an excellent time to study the book Assholeology: The Science Behind Getting Your Way -- and Getting Away with it. In fact, the cosmos would not only look the other way if you acted on the principles described therein; the cosmos is actively encouraging you to be a successful jerk. APRIL FOOL! It's true that you're in a phase when it makes sense to be a little extra selfish and eager to bend the world to meet your needs. But according to my analysis, it's crucial that you do this politely and graciously.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Were you under the impression that the sky is completely mapped? It's not. Advances in technology are unveiling a nonstop flow of new mysteries. In a recent lecture, astronomer Joshua Bloom of the University of California described the explosion of wonder. One particular telescope, for example, detects 1.5 million transient phenomena every night, and an average of 10 of those turn out to be previously undiscovered. Reporting on Bloom's work, Space.com compared astronomers' task to "finding a few needles in a giant haystack night after night." I see this challenge as resembling your imminent future, Aries. Mixed in with all the chatter and hubbub, there are some scattered gems out there -- rich revelations and zesty potentials. Will you have the patience to pinpoint them?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Like Bob Dylan in his 1962 song "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall," you've done a lot of rough and tumble living lately. You've "stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains." You've "stepped in the middle of seven sad forests." You've "been out in front of a dozen dead oceans." Maybe most wrenching of all, you've "seen a highway of diamonds with nobody on it." The good news is that the hard rain will end soon. In these last days of the downpour, I suggest you trigger a catharsis for yourself. Consider doing something like what Dylan did: "I'll think it and speak it and breathe it / And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it."

"Dear Mr. Astrologer: Like the god Prometheus, I stole fire from the gods and gave it to people who sometimes make awful use of it. As punishment, the gods chained me to a rock on the beach, and arranged for an eagle to come daily to eat my liver. Luckily, the liver grows back every night. Unluckily, the eagle always returns to devour it again. I'm used to it by now; it doesn't hurt as much as it once did. But I'm still eager to get out of my predicament. Any suggestions? Aries in Limbo." Dear Aries: Your rescue is scheduled for no later than your birthday, possibly before. In the meantime, the best thing you can do to prepare for your release is to feel gratitude for all you've learned during your ordeal.

"The most fundamental form of human stupidity is forgetting what we were trying to do in the first place," said Friedrich Nietzsche. So for instance, if you're the United States government and you invade and occupy Afghanistan in order to wipe out al-Qaeda, it's not too bright to continue fighting and dying and spending obscene amounts of money long after the al-Qaeda presence there has been eliminated. (There are now fewer than 100 al-Qaeda fighters in that country.) What's the equivalent in your personal life, Aries? What noble aspiration propelled you down a winding path that led to entanglements having nothing to do with your original aspiration? It's time to correct the mistake.



Take inventory of the extent that "No" dominates your life. Notice how often you say or think: 1. "That's not right." 2. "I don't like that." 3. "I don't agree with that." 4. "They don't like me." 5. "I'm not very good." 6. "That should be different from what it is." For help in retraining yourself to say "Yes!" at least 51% of the time, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.

"Newspapers are unable, seemingly, to discriminate between a bicycle accident and the collapse of civilization," said George Bernard Shaw more than six decades ago -- and it's still true. It's very important that you be more discerning than newspapers in the coming weeks, Aries. You can't afford to confuse a minor mess with a major snafu; it would be a big mistake to treat a small temporary detour as a permanent loss of momentum. Please keep your melodramatic tendencies in check, even as you appreciate the entertainment value of your ever-shifting story.

"There are nights when the wolves are silent and only the moon howls," said comedian George Carlin. "There are mornings when your dreams are more real and important than your waking life," says my favorite dream worker. "There are times when the doctor isn't feeling well, and only his patient can cure him," says I. Now it so happens, Aries, that in the upcoming week, your life is likely to pass through an alternate reality where all three of the above conditions will prevail -- as well as other similar variants and mutations.

"Before I loved you, nothing was my own," wrote Pablo Neruda to his lover in one of his sonnets. "It all belonged to someone else -- to no one." Have you ever experienced a sense of being dispossessed like that, Aries? A sense of there being nowhere and nothing in the world that you can call your own? And have you ever fantasized that your emptiness could be remedied by the intimate presence of a special companion? I wish for you to have that consoling experience in the coming week. In fact, I predict it. Happy Valentine Daze!



The horoscopes you read here may be all you need from me. But if you'd like a bigger dose of my thoughts about your destiny, try my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES.

Now and then, members of other astrological signs complain that I seem to favor you Aries above them. If that's true, I'm certainly not aware of it. As far as I know, I love all the signs equally. I will say this, however: Due to the idiosyncrasies of my own personal horoscope, I have been working for years to get more skilled at expressing qualities that your tribe tends to excel at: being direct, acting fearless, knowing exactly what you want, cultivating a willingness to change, and leading by example. All these assets are especially needed by the people in your life right now.



If you missed any of the long-term, big-picture horoscopes I wrote for you the past seven weeks, I've gathered them together and bundled them in one place. Go here to read a compendium of your forecasts for 2011.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What rewards do you deserve for all the good living and the hard work you've done since your last birthday? And what amends should you make for the mediocre living and the work you've shirked since your last birthday? If you choose this week to take care of these two matters with purposeful clarity, you will ensure the best possible outcomes. The reward you earn will be the right one, and the amends you offer will provide the proper correction.



You can still listen to my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Each report in the three-part series of EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES is 7-9 minutes long. A new short-term forecast for this week is also available. Sign in to access the 'scopes here.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The age-old question comes up for review once again: Which should predominate, independence or interdependence? The answer is always different, of course, depending on the tenor of the time and the phase of your evolution. But in the coming weeks, at least, my view is that you should put more emphasis on interdependence. I think you'll reap huge benefits from wholeheartedly blending your energies with allies whose power and intelligence match yours.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What empire are you building, Aries? What master plan are you in the midst of carrying out? As you gaze out upon your realm, are you content with the way it's evolving? Judging from the current astrological omens, I'd say it's an excellent time to ponder questions like those. And if your inventory reveals that you're missing some pieces of the big picture's puzzle, I suggest you set out on a quest to locate them.



How can you conspire with life to create the best possible future for yourself? What well-informed and ingenious approaches can you use to get the most out of the raw materials you're presented with? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In a famous psychology experiment, test subjects watched a video of six people passing basketballs to each other. Their assignment was to count how many passes were thrown and caught by the three people wearing white shirts, while ignoring passes between the three wearing black shirts. But there was a trick embedded in the exercise. Midway through the video, a person wearing a gorilla suit ambled into the scene, thumped his chest, and quickly departed. Half of the test subjects did not notice this intrusion. They were too focused on the task of counting the passes made by the players in white. (Watch it here.) In the coming week, Taurus, I expect that you will experience at least one similar trick. Look for the unexpected.



As you plunge into 2011, would you like to clarify your purpose? Are there fantasies playing at the back of your mind that you'd like to bring fully into your awareness? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)


Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Astrologer Hunter Reynolds says that when you are at your best, you Geminis specialize in "enlightened impatience." You don't get trapped expressing polite deference in situations that drain your energy. You don't tolerate boring experiences just because they're supposed to be good for you. You'd rather "err on the side of learning-through-too-much-movement" than get bogged down in "principled sluggishness." But while that's how you are when you're at your peak, you can also be susceptible to the dark side of this talent. Sometimes you abort a potential breakthrough by prematurely fleeing a useful but difficult scene. I suspect you may be prone to that kind of behavior right now. My advice: Be skeptical of your escape reflex.



Are you ready to shed your superstitious fears about the future? Would you like to slip into 2011 armed with an influx of confidence and poise? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In her poem "Heathen," Lesley Wheeler describes a young boy who puts his ear up against his mother's ear "so that the god in your head can talk / to the god in mine." The coming weeks would be an excellent time for you to try something similar with people you care for. It's a ripe moment to raise the stakes in your intimate life . . . to get closer than you've dared to get before . . . to retire the familiar stories you and your allies are in the habit of exchanging so that you can tune in to the deeper hum of each other's wilder truths.



What new influences will be headed your way in 2011? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? How can you make best use of these influences and resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)


Leo (July 23-August 22)

There's a guy on the Internet -- calls himself Tian -- whose mission is to correct Westerners who misunderstand and misuse Chinese characters. Many of the people who write to him for advice are Americans who have come to suspect that the Chinese characters they got tattooed on their flesh don't really mean what they were led to believe. For example, Tian informed one person that a tattoo whose character supposedly says "to learn as much as possible" actually means "empty, hollow, bare, deserted." I offer this up as a cautionary tale, Leo. In the coming days, make sure you're not under a misapprehension about what you're taking on and taking in. Choose only the very best imprints -- and verify that they are what you think they are.



Do you understand just how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2011? Are you fully aware of just how much access you have to new resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I regard 2011 as an excellent time for you to cultivate your unique talents, some of which may still be latent or undiscovered. With that in mind, consider these thoughts. Ernest Hemingway said a person had to have "the guts of a burglar" to develop his or her talent. Neurologist and author Dr. Alice W. Flaherty believes that the drive to use one's talent is even more important than the amount of raw talent one has. And here's novelist Erica Jong: "Everyone has talent. What is rare is the courage to follow that 'talent' to the dark place where it leads." P.S. If you do venture into those dark places, you'll eventually uncover ten suns' worth of illumination.



Would you like some inspiration as you muse and wonder about your upcoming adventures in 2011? Do you long to slip out of your habitual thoughts about your life and get a more transcendent view? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Back in 1962, an American company named Corning created a product that was so revolutionary, no one could figure out how to exploit it in practical ways. It was "Gorilla glass," a glass that's so strong it's almost impossible to break or even scratch. Only recently has it found a commercial application, first in cell phones and other mobile devices and next in a new generation of ultra-thin TV screens. I foresee a comparable development in your immediate future, Libra: some ahead-of-its-time breakthrough you made a while ago that can finally be used to improve your life.



What hidden factors will be massaging your destiny in 2011? Could you use some hints about how to prepare for the adventures awaiting you in the next 12 months? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

When I arrived at my acupuncturist's waiting room, there were just two magazines on the table next to my chair: The celebrity rag People Style Weekly and the spiritually oriented Shambala Sun. The first offered articles on "hot new handbags and shoes under $99" and "easy ways to get gorgeous hair, skin, and nails." The second provided a "guide to mindful living," with advice about how to get centered, focused, and relaxed. I thought that was metaphorically similar to the choice you will face in the coming week, Scorpio. It's up to you: Which way do you want to go?



What will be the story of your life in 2011? How can you exert your free will to create the adventures that'll bring out the best in you, even as you find graceful ways to cooperate with the tides of destiny? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

I can almost categorically guarantee that in 2011 you will have no encounters with fire demons, wart-ridden vampires, two-headed dogs, moaning ghosts, wayward werewolves, or extraterrestrial robots. Nope. You can pretty much go ahead and make plans based on the assumption that you won't have to account for intrusions like that. But I can also assure you that the lack of crazy encounters with unhinged monsters does not mean your life will suffer from blahs or boredom. On the contrary: I think this could be one of your most interesting years in a decade. To prepare yourself, make sure you don't unconsciously equate adventure with chaos; imagine what it would be like to experience mystery and intrigue that uplift you.



Do you really know how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2011? Probably not. But I'd like to help you know about that power, and tap into it. This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Forgiveness means giving up all hope for a better past," said comedian Lily Tomlin. I recommend that you make this a keynote during the next six months. According to my understanding of the astrological omens, you will have the best opportunity you've had in a long time to put some of your unsettling memories to sleep for good. This is your big chance to graduate from old anxieties that can never be resolved. You're finally ready to declare your independence from messy burdens and maddening riddles that have haunted you.



What are your plans for the coming year? Could you use some more help mapping out your dreams and schemes? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

If you want to be healed, whether from a physical malady or a psychic wound, there's one prerequisite you have to meet: You have to be willing to learn a lesson that your suffering has invited you to study. I would go so far as to say that no one, no matter how skilled a healer, can help cure you until you have taken that first step. So what teaching is it that you would need to explore in order to transform your distress into wisdom?



Who do you want to become in 2011? Where do you want to go and what do you want to do? I'm ready to help you muse about the interesting possibilities. This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Are you ready to get the fun surprise you were promised in your dreams? Are you fully prepared to collect the elegant prize you were guaranteed before you were born? I don't think you are -- mostly because you're not thoroughly convinced that you deserve these wonders. From what I can tell, your self-doubts are still more substantial than your self-worth. And as long as that holds true, you will continue to hold your just rewards at bay. So let's make it your project in the next three weeks to elevate your levels of self-worth. It doesn't mean you'll have to completely shed your self-doubts, so don't worry about trying to pull off that impossible project. All you need to do is adjust your self-worth to self-doubt ratio so it's at least 51 percent to 49 percent.



What new influences will be headed your way in 2011? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? Would you like some guidance as you figure out how to make best use of those influences and resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"A man may fulfill the object of his existence by asking a question he cannot answer, and attempting a task he cannot achieve," mused 19th-century author Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. Advice that wild could just as well have been dispensed by a feral saint living in a cave in the woods. And now I'm passing it on to you, Aries, just in time for the beginning of what may be your wildest year in a decade. In my astrological opinion, you are ready to be a connoisseur of mysteries that purify the mind and nurture the soul . . . a daredevil of the spirit in quest of seemingly impossible dreams . . . a fierce adept of the wisdom of uncertainty who's in love with unpredictable teachings.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

What confusing commotion would you like to walk away from and never come back to? What lessons have you learned so well that you're overdue to graduate from them? What long-term healing process would you like to finish up so you can finally get started on the building phase that your healing will give you the power to carry out? These are excellent questions to ask yourself as you plan your life in the next six months.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

The Strait of Gibraltar is the narrow passage between Europe and Africa where the Mediterranean Sea joins the Atlantic Ocean. According to legend, in ancient times the Latin phrase "ne plus ultra" was inscribed in the rock overlooking this gateway. It meant "not further beyond," and served as a warning to sailors not to venture out to the wild waters past the strait. Eventually, that cautionary advice became irrelevant, of course. With a sturdy vessel, skilled crew, good preparation, and expert knowledge based on the experience of others, venturing out past the "ne plus ultra" point wasn't dangerous. I hope you'll take that as your cue in 2011, Gemini.



As you plunge in to 2011, would you like to clarify your purpose? Are there fantasies playing at the back of your mind that you'd like to bring fully into your awareness?

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

There were problems with the soccer balls used in the World Cup last year. Many players felt they were difficult to control. Their trajectory was unpredictable. Brazilian forward Luis Fabiano went so far as to say that the ball "doesn't want to be kicked." Other players said the balls were poorly made, like those "you buy in a supermarket." I bring this to your attention as a cautionary metaphor, Cancerian. In 2011 you will be taking part in your equivalent of the World Cup. It will be crucial to have the very best tools and accessories. You can't afford to play with balls that don't respond accurately to your skillful means.



Are you ready to shed your superstitious fears about the future? Would you like to slip into 2011 armed with an influx of confidence and poise?

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Biological diversity refers to the variety of life forms in any particular area, while cultural diversity measures the richness of social forms of expression. Then there's biocultural diversity, which measures both together. Can you guess the places on the planet where biocultural diversity is highest? They're Indonesia, Malaysia, Melanesia, the Amazon Basin, and Central Africa. I would love it if you had a chance to immerse yourself in environments like those in 2011, Leo. If you can't manage that, find the next best thing. You will thrive by exposing yourself to a kaleidoscopic mix of human types and natural influences.



What new influences will be headed your way in 2011? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? How can you make best use of these influences and resources?

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

When I started my rock band World Entertainment War, I was guided by a vision of us having two lead singers, me and another person. Ultimately I chose a woman named Darby Gould as my collaborator. While I have decent skills as a vocalist, her talent is genius-level. I knew that our work together would push me to be at the top of my game and allow me to write ambitious songs that I didn't have the chops to sing by myself. I've always been pleased with how that strategy worked. Would you consider giving yourself a similar challenge in 2011, Virgo? It'll be the Year of Collaboration for you. Why not put yourself in a position to transcend the limitations you have when operating solely under your own power?



Do you understand just how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2011? Are you fully aware of just how much access you have to new resources?

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Africa is cracking open in preparation for the birth of a new ocean. The whole process will take 10 million years, but the first sign occurred in 2005, when a 37-mile-long fissure appeared in Ethiopia. Eventually, say geologists, the rift will grow enormous and fill up with seawater. I expect a metaphorically comparable development for you in 2011, Libra: the subtle yet monumental beginning of a new "ocean" you'll be enjoying and learning from and dealing with for many years to come. 



Would you like some inspiration as you muse and wonder about your upcoming adventures in 2011? Do you long to slip out of your habitual thoughts about your life and get a more transcendent view?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In 1967, the U.S. had 31,225 nuclear warheads. But by 2010 it had a mere 5,113. The world's most militarized nation hopes to scale down to an even more modest 3,000 or so by 2021. In the coming year, Scorpio, I'd love to see you be inspired by that example to begin reducing your own levels of anger and combativeness. You don't have to do away entirely with your ability to fight everyone who doesn't agree with you and everything you don't like; just cut back some. I'm sure that'll still leave you with plenty of firepower.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"The heart is forever inexperienced," said Thoreau. He believed our feeling nature is eternally innocent; that no matter how much we learn about the game of life, sadness or lust or rage or joy hits us as hard the thousandth time as it did in the beginning. But is that really true? Are you as likely to plunge into mind-exploding infatuation with your fourth lover as you were with your first? Are you as susceptible now to having your world turned upside-down by flash floods of emotion as you were at age 15? Over the years, haven't you acquired wisdom about your reactive tendencies, and hasn't that transformed them? I disagree with Thoreau. I say that for the person who wants to cultivate emotional intelligence, the heart sure as hell better be capable of gaining experience. What do you think, Sagittarius? If you're aligned with my view, 2011 will educate and ripen your heart as never before.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"We have to stumble though so much dirt and humbug before we reach home," wrote novelist Herman Hesse. "And we have no one to guide us. Our only guide is homesickness." That's the bad news, Capricorn. The good news, according to my analysis, is that 2011 could very well be the year that your homesickness drives you all the way home. For best results, keep this tip in mind: To get the full benefit of the homesickness, you shouldn't suppress it. Only by feeling it deeply, as a burning, grinding ache, will you be able to ride it all the way home.



Do you really know how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2011? Probably not. But I'd like to help you know about that power, and tap into it.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In the past, few dog shows allowed mutts to compete. Pure breeds were prized above all others. That's changing, though, now that the American Kennel Club has opened up a new category just for mongrels. They won't be judged by guidelines specific to a particular breed, but rather according to their natural talents. This shift in standards mirrors a comparable development in your world, Aquarius. In 2011, it'll be easier to find success simply by being your mottled, speckled, variegated self. There'll be less pressure for you to live up to standards of perfection meant for the pure breeds.



What are your plans for the coming year? Could you use some more help mapping out your dreams and schemes? This week and next week, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 2 and Part 3 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in!

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"All your longings know where to go," writes poet Nick Piombino, "but you have to tell them to open their eyes." That's one of your big assignments in 2011, Pisces: to make sure your longings keep their eyes open. It's not as easy as it might sound. Sometimes your longings get so entranced by obsessive fantasies -- so distracted by the stories that are swirling around in your imagination -- that they're blind to what's right in front of them. You must speak to your longings tenderly and patiently, as you would a beloved animal, coaxing them to trust that life will bring more interesting and useful blessings than anything fantasy could provide.



Who do you want to become in 2011? Where do you want to go and what do you want to do? I'm ready to help you muse about the interesting possibilities. This week and next week, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 2 and Part 3 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in!

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Just because everything is different doesn't mean anything has changed," said writer Irene Peter. That should be cautionary advice for you in 2011, Aries. From what I can tell, it will be relatively easy for you to rearrange the way things look, but trickier to transform them from the inside out. You will have to be vigilant to keep from getting swept up in the giddiness of big talk at the expense of practical action. You'll have to push hard to make sure that seductive ideas are translated into concrete details. Can you do it? I think you can.



This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2011. Tune in! Start imagining the big picture of your life in the coming months, and start planning to take maximum advantage of cosmic rhythms.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In 1967, John McCain was a U.S. Navy pilot fighting in Vietnam. Shot down during a bombing mission, he was captured and jailed in the notorious Hanoi Hilton prison camp, where he was tortured. After being freed in 1973, he returned to the U.S. and eventually launched a political career. When he ran for president in 2008, his candidacy got an endorsement from an unlikely source: Tran Trong Duyet, the Vietnamese prison commander who had supervised his torture. In the coming months, Taurus, I expect you to experience a turnaround that will have comparable poetic justice. I'm not sure how it will unfold. Maybe an adversary will praise you, a person who wounded you will make amends, or a force of nature that once opposed you will come over to your side. Twenty-eleven will be a Year of Vindicating Reversals.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Can you finally escape the pain you got imprinted with during adolescence? Is it a realistic possibility that you could triumph over the conditioning you absorbed before you knew how to talk? Do you have the power to do what few of us have done, which is to get out from under the weight of the past, shed the inertia of your memories, and live brave and free in the raw truth of NOW? If there will ever in your life be a time when you can accomplish at least some of this noble quest, Gemini, it will be in 2011.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Decades ago, the U.S. built a network of sleek expressways to make it fast and easy for cars to travel between cities. But like many of America's impressive engineering feats, this one took little account of what the human soul might enjoy. Ugly buildings or empty spaces surround many of those roads. Visually, the difference between I-95 in Georgia and I-74 in Illinois is negligible. "The Interstate highway system has made it possible," said Charles Kuralt, "to go from sea to shining sea without seeing anything." You cannot afford to let this be your operative metaphor in 2011, Cancerian. Your potential for rapid, extensive progress is sizable, but it would be a mistake to barrel along with your eyes fixed on the prize in the distance as you neglect what's happening along the way. Be both global and local; romance the details as you revel in the big picture.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Fixing people's teeth is one of Dr. Peter Kertesz's specialties. The British dentist has a thriving business in London. Now and then he's also called on to practice an exotic variation: animal dentistry. Recently, he corrected the tooth problems of two tigers in a zoo. Other species he has helped include elephants, whales, and pandas. In 2011, Leo, I suggest you consider branching out like Dr. Kertesz. What would be the equivalent, in your domain, of expanding the ways you use your primary skills?

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"What can I do with this eternal longing?" That's the first line of "Assouf," a song by the African band Tinariwen. During the rest of the tune, the singer never offers a definitive answer to that plea, but as he tumbles and rumbles over the possibilities, the band plays a lot of righteous music. I suggest that you make Tinariwen's cry your question of the year in 2011. It will be an excellent use of your time to meditate on how to call forth, nurture, and direct your ineffable, insatiable yearning. (Hear the song.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

In 2011, I believe you will have the chance to weave your fortunes together with an abundance of allies who are good for you. They will be your equals, they will share at least some of your most important values, and they will respect you for who you are. That's excellent news, right? My only worry is that you might shy away from the demands that such invigorating collaborations will make on you. It would be less work, after all, to fall back into reliance on more prosaic relationships that don't ask so much of you. Please don't take the easy way out, Libra. Rise to the occasion!

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Michelangelo didn't think of himself as primarily a painter. Sculpture was his first love. Yet in 1508 he was coaxed into painting prodigious frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. As he worked for four years, covering 12,000 square feet with sublime images, he sometimes complained and felt resentful. The project took him away from two large sculptures he would have preferred to be working on. He feared his enemies had convinced the Pope to give him this task in order to demonstrate how mediocre his painting was. But today his work at the Sistine Chapel is regarded as a masterpiece. I suspect that in 2011 you may face a version of Michelangelo's dilemma, Scorpio: being offered a job you don't consider your forte. It's quite possible, however, that accepting this "diversion" will yield interesting results.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"When I became a man I put away childish things," said Sagittarian author C.S. Lewis, "including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up." I suggest you take up that attitude yourself in 2011, Sagittarius. One of your top assignments in the coming months will be to play with greater intensity and more frequency and a heightened imagination. If you want to achieve your adult goals, you'll be wise to recreate your childhood wisdom on a higher octave.



What hidden factors will be massaging your destiny in 2011? Could you use some hints about how to prepare for the adventures awaiting you in the next 12 months?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"We Americans are the best informed people on earth as to the events of the last 24 hours," wrote historian Will Durant some decades ago. "We are the not the best informed as to the events of the last sixty centuries," he concluded. Today this describes many Westerners, not just Americans. We are adrift in the Age of the Short Attention Span -- a time when the lessons of the past are becoming lost or irrelevant. But in 2011, I'll be rooting for you to elude this curse, Capricorn. It's crucial for you to be in close touch with both the lessons provided by the grand sweep of human civilization and by your own personal history. 



What will be the story of your life in 2011? How can you exert your free will to create the adventures that'll bring out the best in you, even as you find graceful ways to cooperate with the tides of destiny?

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"The third-rate mind is only happy when it is thinking with the majority," said author A.A. Milne. "The second-rate mind is only happy when it is thinking with the minority. The first-rate mind is only happy when it is thinking." You will have an excellent chance to cultivate that definition of a first-rate mind in 2011, Aquarius. According to my reading of the astrological omens, life will be conspiring to strengthen your brain. You will have everything going for you if you make it your intention to sharpen your wits, use language more precisely, and see the world with greater clarity and objectivity. To get the fun started, make a list of what you could do to push your intelligence beyond its current limits.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"Anything you're good at contributes to happiness," said philosopher Bertrand Russell. If I had my way, Pisces, you'd write that on a note and tape it to your bathroom mirror for the duration of 2011. I think it would raise your appreciation for the power your personal gifts have to bestow blessings on both yourself and others. And I hope it would inspire you to spend a lot of quality time finding out all you can about what you're good at and deepening your capacity to do what you're good at.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"There's always one moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in," wrote novelist Graham Greene. I'll add to that: There are at least three moments in adulthood when a new door opens and invites the rest of the future in. Judging by the astrological omens, I'm guessing that one such breakthrough lies ahead for you in 2011. What can you do to expedite and encourage fate's summons? Here's one possibility: Surrender to the naked truth of what you love.



This week my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES offer you a teaser look at some of the major themes you will be working and playing with in 2011. Then, beginning December 28, I will devote three consecutive weeks of EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES to an in-depth discussion of your long-range outlook for the coming 12 months. Tune in!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I vividly remember seeing singer Diamanda Galas in concert. Though classically trained, she didn't confine herself to mellifluous melodies and elegant tones. She was a whirlwind of elemental sound, veering from animalistic bellows to otherworldly chants to operatic glossolalia. It was all very entertaining, and often enjoyable. The skill with which she shaped the sound as it escaped her body was prodigious. My companion and I agreed that "she made your ears convulse and your eyes writhe and your skin prickle -- but in a good way." How would you feel about inviting some similar experiences into your life, Aries? The astrological omens suggest this would be an excellent time to seek the rowdy healing that only disciplined wildness can provide.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the coming weeks, life will beguile you with secrets and riddles but probably not reveal as much as you'd like. I think this is an opportunity, not a problem. In my opinion, your task isn't to press for shiny clarity, but rather to revel in the luxuriant mysteries. Let them confer their blessings on you through the magic of teasing and tantalizing. And what is the nature of those blessings? To enlighten your irrational mind, stimulate your imagination, teach you patience, and nurture your connection with eternity.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Physicist Stephen Hawking believes it would be dangerous to get in touch with extraterrestrial creatures. "If aliens visit us," he says, "the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans." Those who've studied the teeming evidence for UFOs would say that Hawking's warning is too late. Some mysterious non-human intelligence has been here for a long time, and the fact that we are still around proves they're no Spanish conquistadors. Aside from that, though, let's marvel at the stupidity of Hawking's lame advice. As any mildly wise person knows, exploring the unknown is not only an aid to our mental and spiritual health -- it's a prerequisite. That'll be especially true for you Aries in the coming weeks.



Assume that your drive to experience pleasure isn't a barrier to your spiritual growth, but is in fact essential to it. Proceed on the hypothesis that cultivating joy can make you a more ethical and compassionate person. Imagine that feeling good has something important to teach you every day. For inspiration in practicing this approach, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Should you rely on hard facts or soft feelings? Would it be advisable to trust your tried-and-true medicine or else a potion brewed from the tongue of a snake, the feather of a crow, and a mandrake root? Can you get better results by mingling with staunch allies or with rebel upstarts who have a knack for shaking things up? Only you can decide on these matters, Aries. My opinion? You'll probably generate more interesting developments by going with the feelings, the mandrake root, and the upstarts.



"Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show." So begins Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield. I'd like to inspire you to write a story of your own that begins like that. For help, tune into your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"You don't want to be the best of the best," said Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia. "You just want to be the only one who does what you do." That's always good advice, but it will be especially apt for you during the next few weeks. You're entering a phase when competing with other people will get you nowhere fast. What will get you somewhere fast is nurturing your unique talents and proclivities. Do you know exactly what they are? If you're even a little fuzzy, make it your quest to get very clear.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Where I live, 35 percent of all high school students confess (or brag) that they have engaged in binge drinking, which is defined as imbibing five or more alcoholic drinks in a two-hour period. According to my reading of the omens, your inner teenager may soon be longing to flirt with that kind of intense and total release. Can I talk him or her out of it? As much as I sympathize with the younger you's need to escape the numbing effects of the daily grind, I'm asking the adult you to step in and assert your authority. Try to find a more constructive approach to liberation.



How's your fight for freedom going? Are you making progress in liberating yourself from your unconscious obsessions, bad habits, and conditioned responses? For assistance and inspiration, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In Marcel Proust's novel In Search of Lost Time, one of the characters makes a vulgar observation about the odd attractions that sometimes come over us human beings: "Anyone who falls in love with a dog's behind will mistake it for a rose." It's my duty to point out that the opposite occurs, too. People may think a marvelous thing is worthless, and dislike it or ignore it as a result. Van Gogh's paintings, for example: He sold only one while he was alive, although today his work is regarded as extraordinarily beautiful. My advice to you, Aries, is to avoid both of these errors in the coming week.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the Chinese province of Fujian, there used to be people who believed they could communicate directly with the dead. If they slept on the grave of the person they wished to reach, their dreams during the night might lead to a meeting with the spirit of the departed. I propose that you consider something similar, Aries. Why? Because according to my reading of the astrological omens, you would benefit from communing with your ancestors. If you can't actually spend the night near their final resting place, find another way to contact them in dreams. Put their photos under your pillow, maybe, or hold one of their beloved objects as you sleep. Halloween costume suggestion: the ancestor whose influence you need most right now.



Factual information and reasonable thinking alone are not sufficient to guide you through life¬ís labyrinthine tests. You need and deserve regular deliveries of uncanny revelation. One of your inalienable rights as a human being should therefore be to receive mysteriously useful omens on a regular basis. In this spirit, I offer you the free weekly horoscopes you read here. If you ever want more, and think it's worth paying for, try my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES or daily text message 'scopes.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"There's one ultimate goal during sex," says Cosmopolitan magazine, a renowned source of erotic guidance for women. That is "to be as sensually stimulated as possible." I don't quite agree with that assessment. Having emotionally pleasing fun should also be an important consideration, as well as creating a playful ambiance and invoking spiritual grace. But sensual stimulation is good, too. So what, in the view of Cosmopolitan, is the key to cultivating maximum bliss? "Having lots of steamy info at your disposal." That's definitely sound advice for you right now, Aries. You're in a favorable phase for finding out more about everything that will enhance your access to delight, including the sexual kind.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Until recently, no cricket had ever been observed pollinating a flower. All the evidence showed, in fact, that crickets don't help flowers -- they devour them. Then one night last January on the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean, researchers discovered that the species known as the raspy cricket was responsible for pollinating wild orchids. They even caught the magic act on film. I regard this turn of events as akin to an upcoming development in your life: Someone or something that you've never thought of as a fertilizing force for you will become one.

Much of the reader mail I receive is friendly. But now and then I'll get a message like this: "I've followed your horoscopes with pleasure for years. But I must say, you've really lost it lately. I can't stand the garbage you've been slinging. What happened to you?" My response is to wonder why the person never wrote to me while he was happy with my efforts. It reminds me of a quote by Leon Uris: "How often in life it is that we have no time for our friends but all the time in the world for our enemies." It also reminds me of how tempting it is to focus on what repels us and scares us, shortchanging the dreams that excite us. Your assignment in the next four weeks, Aries, is to reward what you like and pursue what you want. For now, forget about what you don't like and don't want.



Take inventory of the extent that "No" dominates your life. Notice how often you say or think: 1. "That's not right." 2. "I don't like that." 3. "I don't agree with that." 4. "They don't like me." 5. "I'm not very good." 6. "That should be different from what it is." For help in retraining yourself to say "Yes!" at least 51% of the time, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Nine-year-old Fatima Santos told the San Francisco Chronicle her opinions about the movie Toy Story: "If I had to make a movie like this, I would make it funnier. I would make Mr. Potato Head look funnier that he already does. I would put his hair on his legs, his shoes on his head, and his arms on his face. His eyeballs would be on the place where his arms are." In the coming week, Aries, I advise you to engage in Fatima's enlightened style of cockeyed thinking. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you have the power and the mandate to improve pretty much every scenario you're in by making it less predictable, more rambunctious, and just plain funnier.

Rightwing talk show host Rush Limbaugh is a person whose ideas and attitudes repel me. But in the dream I had last night, I enjoyed hanging out with him. He was affable and humorous. We had several fun adventures together. Here's how I interpret the dream: It doesn't necessarily mean that Limbaugh is a better human being than my bias allows me to imagine. Rather, I think I'm becoming more relaxed about people I disagree with. I'm less susceptible to being motivated by hatred. I'm able to maintain a live-and-let-live approach to things that used to knock me off center. You're now set up for a similar shift, Aries. I hope you take advantage.

When teen pop star Miley Cyrus appeared on David Letterman's late-night TV talk show, band leader Paul Schaeffer asked her if she lip-syncs to pre-recorded music during her performances. Miley replied that no, she never fakes it. For evidence, she said, anyone could go watch a Youtube clip from one of her concerts. Sometimes she sounds terrible, which proves that she's risking the imperfection of actually singing live. I urge you to follow Miley's lead in your own sphere, Aries. In the coming week, you really do need to be as raw as the law allows. Be your authentic self, please -- with no Auto-Tune-like enhancements.



When they say "Be yourself," which self do they mean? Certainly not the self that wants to win every game and use up every resource and stand alone at the end of time on a mountain of pretty garbage. So which self is it? For guidance, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

My friend Alana suffered from a mysterious ailment for months. Symptoms included vertigo, stomach pains, and numbness in her legs. After being treated unsuccessfully by six health care practitioners, both mainstream and alternative, she went to see Dr. Ling, a Chinese herbalist recommended by a friend. Ling was a dour woman who made no eye contact. Her office was dingy, cramped, and windowless. Alana felt a bit depressed by the visit. Yet when she took Dr. Ling's herbs, she felt better. In three weeks she was cured. The moral of the story, Aries: The restorative agent you need may not come in the most inviting form.

In an old comedy sketch called "One Leg Too Few," a one-legged man comes in to a casting agent's office to audition for the part of Tarzan in an upcoming show. The agent is as diplomatic as he can be given the fact that the role would best be played by a strapping young man with exceptional running and leaping skills. "It's possible that no two-legged men will apply," the agent tells the applicant, "in which case you could get the part." Don't be like the one-legged man in this story, Aries. While I usually encourage you to think big and dream of accomplishing amazing feats, this is one time when you should respect your limitations.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Why should you work harder than everyone else? Why is it up to you to pick up the slack when others are suffering from outbreaks of laziness and incompetence? And why should you be the fearless leader who is focused on fixing the glitches and smoothing over the rough patches when no one else seems to care whether things fall apart? I'll tell you why, Aries: because it's the Karmic Correction phase of your long-term cycle -- a time when you can atone for past mistakes, pay off old debts, and make up for less-than-conscientious moves you got away with once upon a time.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the 18th century, the French Academy laid down rules about the differences between professional and amateur paintings. For example, it was decreed that true artists must create a "licked surface," hiding all evidence of their brushstrokes. The illusion was more convincing that way; viewers could sink their attention fully into the image without being distracted by thoughts about the artist's process. When the Impressionists barged into the scene in the 1870s, one of their rebellions against convention was to reject the licked surface. By making some of their brushstrokes visible, they declared they weren't interested in upholding the artifice. They wanted their audience to get involved in their subjective interpretation of the scene that was portrayed. In the coming week, Aries, I encourage you to be like the Impressionists. Forget about trying to present a licked surface. Reveal the inner workings that are whirling and humming behind your eyes.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When I studied method acting with David Mamet, he taught us to develop such a vivid imagination that we could taste the pretend coffee that we drank out of an imaginary cup. We'd feel the heft of the cup in our hand and the steamy heat rising. We'd hallucinate the bitterly flavorful smell, and the muscles of our face would move the way they might if we were sipping the real thing. Pop star Lady Gaga didn't work with Mamet while she was maturing as an actress, but she got similar teachings. Recently, she told New York magazine that she can "feel the rain, when it's not raining." And more than that: "I can actually mentally give myself an orgasm." If you think that you will ever want to have that strong an imagination, Aries, now is a good time to start working toward that goal.



Whether it's your time to ferment in the shadows or sing in the sun, fresh power to transform yourself is on the way. Life always delivers the creative energy you need to change into the new thing you must become. For more help in understanding it all, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The ancient Greek god Dionysus did not, in fact, encourage people to get sloppy drunk, lose control, and do stupid things. His preference was that they free themselves from their inhibitions by imbibing moderate amounts of alcohol. With this medicinal spur, they might get unstuck from their worn-out old behavior patterns and invite refreshing doses of wildness into their lives. Healing was the intention, not craziness and frenzy. It is true that if someone was not willing to escape their rigidity -- if they clung to their hidebound attitudes and refused to open up to the call of self-transformation -- Dionysus might lure them into reckless inebriation. Keep these thoughts in mind in the coming weeks, Aries.

It's a meditation about the difference between your fearful fantasies and your authentic, accurate intuitions. My approach there has a close resemblance to the style of my weekly EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Success coach Tom Ferry says our ability to pursue our dreams can be damaged by four addictions: 1. an addiction to what other people think of us; 2. an addiction to creating melodrama in a misguided quest for excitement; 3. an addiction to believing we're imprisoned by what happened in the past; 4. an addiction to negative thoughts that fill us with anxiety. The good news, Aries, is that in the coming weeks you will find it easier than usual to free yourself from addictions 1, 3, and 4. On the other hand, you may be extra susceptible to addiction 2. So take action to make sure you don't fall victim to it! What can you do to avoid distracting adventures and trivial brouhahas?



What exactly are you looking for? How would you describe the experiences you want more than anything else? It's possible my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE could give you additional help in figuring that out.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Revenge fantasies would pollute your consciousness. I advise you to repress them. Wallowing in resentment would have an equally deleterious effect. Don't you dare give that emotion a foothold. On the other hand, fantasies of experiencing pleasure and joy, even if they're escapist illusions, will tonify and invigorate your awareness. I recommend that you indulge in them at great length, unleashing your imagination to explore a variety of blissful scenarios in tremendous detail and with ingenious flourishes. In fact, as your part-time soul doctor, I can't think of anything else that would be more beneficial to your physical and mental health.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Thou shalt not kill" is a crucial rule for you to follow, and not just in the literal sense. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you should also be extra vigilant as you avoid more metaphorical kinds of destruction. Please be careful not to unleash ill-chosen words that would crush someone's spirit (including your own). Don't douse newly kindled fires, don't burn recently built bridges, and don't deprive fresh sprouts of the light they need to keep growing. To put this all in a more positive frame: It's time for you to engage in a reverent and boisterous celebration of life, nurturing and fostering and stimulating everywhere you go.

Have you added some bulk and stability to your foundation any time recently, Aries? Have you grown your roots deeper and asked for more from your traditional sources and recommitted yourself to your primal vows? I hope so, because this is a perfect time, astrologically speaking, to strengthen your link to everything that sustains you. You have a sacred duty to push harder for access to the stuff that builds your emotional intelligence and fuels your long-range plans. 



Grace emerges in the ebb and flow, not just the flow. The waning reveals a different blessing than the waxing. Where are you in the great cycle of your life?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Aries? Since we're halfway through 2010, let's take an inventory. I'm hoping you're well underway in the heroic task of conquering your past. It has been and will continue to be prime time for you to wean yourself from unresolvable energy-drains. So exorcise irksome ghosts, please! Pay off ancient debts! Free yourself from memories that don't serve you! You're finally ready to graduate from lessons you've had to learn and re-learn and re-re-learn. The coming months will bring you even more opportunities to finish up old business that has demanded too much of your time and energy.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A few years ago, a group of artists built a giant bunny out of pink wool on an Italian mountainside. The 200-foot-long effigy will remain there until 2025. There's a disturbing aspect to this seemingly goofy artifact, however: It has a wound in its side where its guts are spilling out. That's why I don't recommend that you travel there and commune with it. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you would definitely benefit from crawling into a fetal position and sucking your thumb while lying in the comfy embrace of a humongous mommy substitute.  But you shouldn't tolerate any tricks or jokes that might limit your ability to sink into total peace and relaxation.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Istanbul is the world's only mega-city that spans two continents. Many Turkish commuters take the 15-minute ferry ride across the Bosphorus Strait, traveling from their suburban homes in Asia to the urban sprawl in Europe. I'm seeing a comparable journey for you, Aries: a transition that happens casually and quickly, but that moves you from one world to another. Prepare yourself, please. Just because it unfolds relatively easily and benevolently doesn't mean you should be nonchalant about the adjustments it will require you to make.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

When you want to get rid of a weed that's impinging on the autonomy of your growing tomato plant, you don't just tear away its stalk and leaves; you yank it out by the roots. That's the approach I urge you to take with the saboteur that has inserted itself into your otherwise thriving patch of heaven. There's no need to express hatred or rage. In fact, it's better to be lucid and neutral as you thoroughly remove the invasive influence and assert your right to care for what you love.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

A lot of people never got the mothering they needed in order to grow up into the confident, secure lovers of life they have the potential to become. But even greater numbers suffer from a lack of smart fathering. And that happens to be the deprivation that's most important for you Geminis to address right now. If there was anything missing in the guidance and mentoring you got from your actual daddy, I urge you to brainstorm about how you could make up for it in the coming months. For starters, here's one idea: Is there any father figure out there who could inspire you to become more of your own father figure?

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In 1965, two Russian cosmonauts orbited the Earth in the Voskhod 2 spacecraft. Due to equipment problems, they had to land the vehicle manually. Instead of hitting the target area, they mistakenly set down in rugged mountainous country covered with deep snow. While they waited overnight inside their capsule, wolves gathered outside, howling and pacing. But the next day their recovery team reached them and scared off the hungry predators. Soon they were safely on their way back home. Let this little tale be an inspiration to you, Cancerian, as you come in for your landing. Even though you may not end up quite where you intended, there'll be a happy ending as long as you wait for your allies to be ready for you and you don't try to rush your re-integration.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

The ancient Greek philosopher Plato advocated the use of dogs in courtrooms. He thought that canines were expert lie detectors; that they always knew when deceit was in the air. I suspect you'll display a similar talent in the coming days, Leo. You will have a sixth sense about when the truth is being sacrificed for expediency, or when delusions are masquerading as reasonable explanations, or when the ego's obsessions are distorting the hell out of the soul's authentic understandings. Harness that raw stuff, please. Use it discreetly, surgically, and with compassion.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

If you've been aligned with cosmic rhythms these past few weeks, Virgo, you've been rising higher and feeling bolder. You've taken a stand on issues about which you had previously been a bit weak and cowardly. You have been able to articulate elusive or difficult truths in graceful ways that haven't caused too terrible a ruckus. Your next challenge is to rally the troops. The group that means the most to you is in need of your motivational fervor. I suggest that you think deeply about how to cultivate more dynamic relationships among all the parts, thereby energizing the whole.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Human beings are in a state of creativity 24 hours a day," wrote Raoul Vaneigem in his book The Revolution of Everyday Life. "People usually associate creativity with works of art, but what are works of art alongside the creative energy displayed by everyone a thousand times a day?" I say "amen" to that. All of us are constantly generating fresh ideas, novel feelings, unexpected perceptions, and pressing intentions. We are founts of restless originality. But whether we use our enormous power constructively is another question. Typically, a lot of the stuff we spawn is less than brilliant and useful. Having said that, I'm pleased to announce that you're entering a phase when you have the potential to create far more interesting and useful things than usual -- longer lasting, too.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

If you have been engaged in any S&M; scenario, even metaphorically, now would be a good time to quit it. Whether you're the person who's whipping or being whipped, the connection is no longer serving any worthy purpose. The good news is that freeing yourself from compromising entanglements will make you fully available to explore new frontiers in collaboration. You will also be blessed with an influx of intuition about how to reconfigure bonds that have become blah and boring. And what if you're not currently involved in any S&M; scenario? Congrats! Your assignment is to transform one of your pretty good relationships into a supercharged union that's capable of generating life-changing magic.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

I wouldn't say that things are about to get darker for you. But they're definitely going to get deeper and damper and more complicated. I don't expect there to be any confrontations with evil or encounters with nasty messes, but you may slip down a rabbit hole into a twilight region where all the creatures speak in riddles and nothing is as it seems. And yet that's the best possible place for you to gain new insight about the big questions that so desperately need more clarity. If you can manage to hold your own in the midst of the dream-like adventures, you'll be blessed with a key to relieving one of your long-running frustrations.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The eulachon is a fish that lives off the Pacific Coast of North America. Its fat content is so high that the Chinook Indians used to dry it, thread it with a wick, and employ it as a candle. The stink was bad, but the light was good. Remind you of anything in your life right now, Capricorn? Something that provides a steady flow of illumination, even if it is a bit annoying or inconvenient? I say, treasure it for what it is and accept it for what it isn't.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

When I was growing up in Michigan, playing in the snow was a great joy. As much as I loved the arrival of each new spring, I endured a mourning period as the ground's last patch of dirty sleet melted. Once in late March, though, I talked my mom into letting me store five snowballs in the freezer. It wasn't until my birthday in late June that I retrieved the precious artifacts. I was slightly disappointed to find they had become more like iceballs than snowballs. On the other hand, their symbolism was deeply gratifying. I'd managed to invoke the tangible presence of winter fun in the summertime. I urge you to attempt a comparable alchemy, Aquarius. Figure out how to take a happiness you have felt in another context and transpose it into where you are right now.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"Even Norah Jones got bored with Norah Jones," wrote critic Aidin Vaziri in his review of her recent concert in San Francisco. For years she has tranquilized us with her safe, soothing music, he said, but not any more. It was like she was fresh from a "makeover reality show." Her new stuff, which included an "indie-rock jolt" and quasi-psychedelic riffs, exuded grit and defiance and weirdness. Norah Jones is your role model for the next couple of weeks, Pisces. If there have been any ways in which you've been boring yourself, it's prime time to scramble the code.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The "secret" is in plain sight. The "hidden resource" is freely available for anyone who intends to use it with integrity. The "lost key" is very close to where you left it when you last used it. The "missing link" is missing only in the sense that no one recognizes it for what it is. The "unasked question" is beaming toward you from three directions. The "wounded talent" will be healed the moment you stop thinking of it as wounded and start regarding it as merely unripe.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you'd like to be in supreme alignment with cosmic rhythms this week, I suggest that you completely avoid using the f-word. Likewise, you'll maximize your chances for taking advantage of fate's currents if you refrain from ever using the s-word, the c-word, the m-word, and the b-word. As a general rule, the more precise and the less lazy you are in using language, the more willpower you'll have and the better able you'll be to attract the experiences you want. It's always invigorating to choose your words creatively and kindly, of course, but especially now.



In addition to the horoscopes I write for you, I offer EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES. They're four- to five-minute explorations that go further in uncovering the current state of your destiny.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Mozart once challenged his friend Haydn to play a harpsichord piece he'd written. Haydn tried, but stopped partway through when the musical score called for him to play a note in the middle of the keyboard even though his right hand was fully occupied at the high end and his left hand at the low end. "Nobody can play this," protested Haydn. "I can," said Mozart, who proceeded to perform the piece flawlessly, dipping down to play the problematic note with his nose. In the coming week, Aries, be inspired by Mozart as you not only cover the extremes but also take care of the center.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

All of us have gaps in our education. You and I and everyone else alive have dank pockets of ignorance that diminish our humanity and musty pits of naivete that prevent us from seeing truths that are obvious to others. We all lack certain skills that hold us back from being more fulfilled in our chosen fields. That's the bad news, Aries. The good news is that the gaps in your education will be up for review in the coming weeks -- which means that it'll be an excellent time to make plans to fill them. Here's a good way to get started: Be aggressive in identifying the things that you don't even know you don't know.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What happens when someone "sells out"? Typically, it refers to a person who overrides her highest artistic standards or her soul's mandates in order to make a bundle of money. But I want to enlarge the definition to encompass any behavior that seeks popular appeal at the expense of authenticity, or any action that sacrifices integrity for the sake of gaining power. I think you have to be especially on guard against this lapse in the coming days, Aries -- not only in yourself but also in those you're close to.



What is the obvious secret you can't quite see? How could you turn your challenges into daily gifts for yourself? For clues to mysteries like these, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Hip hop music definitely needs to include more tuba playing. I think that's what's missing from it. Likewise, the sport of skateboarding would benefit from having more dogs and monkeys that can master its complexities; the state of journalism could be improved by including more babies as reporters; and you Aries folks would significantly upgrade your life by learning how to play the game of cricket. (If you believe everything I just said, you'll be equally gullible when a little voice in your head tries to convince you to seek out things you don't really need or adopt behavior that doesn't suit you.)

"In a recipe for salsa published recently, one of the ingredients was misstated, due to an error," said an apology run by a local newspaper. "The correct ingredient is '2 tsp. of cilantro' instead of '2 tsp. of cement.'" This is an example of the kind of miscue you should be alert for in your own life during the coming week, Aries. As long as you pay close attention and spot the tiny booboos as they arise, you won't end up dipping your chips into a gritty, gravely mess.

"Although obstacles and difficulties frighten ordinary people," wrote French painter Theodore Gericault, "they are the necessary food of genius. They cause it to mature, and raise it up . . . All that obstructs the path of genius inspires a state of feverish agitation, upsetting and overturning those obstacles, and producing masterpieces." I'd like to make this idea one of your guiding principles, Aries. In order for it to serve you well, however, you'll have to believe that there is a sense in which you do have some genius within you. It's not necessarily something that will make you rich, famous, popular, or powerful. For example, you may have a genius at washing dogs or giving thoughtful gifts or doing yoga when you're sad. Whatever your unique brilliance consists of, the challenges just ahead will be highly useful in helping it grow.

Photons work hard to get from the heart of the sun to the surface. They can take up to 160,000 years to complete the 400,000+-mile journey. And yet once Earth-bound photons get topside, they travel the 93-million-mile distance to our planet in just over eight minutes. I foresee a metaphorically similar situation unfolding in your life in the coming weeks. A development that has been a long time in the making will accelerate tremendously in its last phase of ripening.

It would be a good week for you to perfect your ability to crow like a rooster, Aries. I also recommend that you practice your skill at leaping out of bed in the morning fully refreshed, with your imagination primed and ready to immediately begin making creative moves. Other suggested exercises: being on the alert for what's being born; holding a vision of the dawn in your heart throughout the day; and humorously strutting around like you own whatever place you're in.

I'm worried about your ability to sneak and fake and dissemble. These skills seem to have atrophied in you. To quote Homer Simpson, "You couldn't fool your own mother on the foolingest day of your life with an electrified fooling machine!" Please, Aries, jump back into the game-playing, BS-dispensing routine the rest of us are caught up in. APRIL FOOL! Everything I just said was a filthy lie. In fact, I admire the candor and straightforwardness you've been cultivating. My only critique is that maybe you could take some of the edge off it. Try telling the raw truth with more relaxed grace.

All but one of our planet's mountain ranges have been mapped: the Gamburtsev Mountains, which are buried under 2.5 miles of ice in Antarctica. Recent efforts to get a read on this craggy landscape, aided by a network of seismic instruments, have revealed some initial details about it, including its role in forming the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. I recommend that you regard the Gamburtsevs as an iconic metaphor in the coming months, Aries. They'll be an apt symbol for one of your life's featured themes: the discovery and exploration of a massive unknown territory that has been hidden from view.



Factual information and reasonable thinking alone are not sufficient to guide you through life's labyrinthine tests. You need and deserve regular deliveries of uncanny revelation.

From what I can tell, your excursion to Fake Paradise didn't exact too serious a toll. The accidental detour may have seemed inopportune in the moment, but you know what? I think it slowed you down enough to keep you from doing something rash that you would have regretted later. And are you really sorry you were robbed of your cherished illusions? In the long run, I think it was for the best. As for the scratches on your nose from when you stuck it into business you weren't "supposed" to: They're a small price to pay for the piquant lesson you got in how not to live.

Sarah Bernhardt (1844-1923) was called "the most famous actress the world has ever known." She did a few films in the early days of the cinema, but most of her work was in the theater. At age 70, she played the role of the 13-year-old Juliet in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. I commend her on her refusal to act her age, and recommend that you make a comparable effort in the coming weeks. For example, if you're in your twenties, try something you thought you wouldn't do until you were at a very ripe age. If you're over 50, be 25 for a while. It's an excellent time to do this kind of time-traveling.



I love to write these horoscopes for you. I also love to record audio meditations for your entertainment and inspiration. Here's a free podcast you might like: It's called SHADOW BLESSINGS.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To place yourself in smooth alignment with planetary rhythms, do conscientious work on the foundations of your life. Take extra care of the people who take care of you. Make sure you have a good supply of the various resources that keep you strong and steady. Check to see if maybe you need to rev up your emotional connection with the traditions you hold dear. But that's only half your horoscope, Aries. Here's the rest: Invite your most rambunctious playmates over for a raucous home-blessing ceremony.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Everything is complicated," wrote poet Wallace Stevens. "If that were not so, life and poetry and everything else would be a bore." I hope you will choose his wisdom to serve as your guiding light in the coming weeks. It is high time, in my astrological opinion, for you to shed any resentment you might feel for the fact that life is a crazy tangle of mystifying and interesting stories. Celebrate it, Aries! Revel in it. Fall down on your knees and give holy thanks for it. And by the way, here's a big secret: To the extent that you do glory in the complications, the complications will enlighten you, amuse you, and enrich you.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I personally don't believe we're living in the worst of times, although I know many people who do. While there are indeed reasons to despair, our current state of affairs is actually in many ways quite glorious. And our struggles are puny compared to those of the generation that lived through the two World Wars and the Great Depression. Having said that, I think it's fine to believe that civilization is in a terrible mess if it motivates you to shed all your trivial distractions and inessential wishes so as to dedicate yourself to living an exciting, generous life that's rich with love and meaning. Now is a prime time for you, Aries, to dedicate yourself to such a path.



The horoscopes you read here may be all you need from me. But if you'd like a bigger dose of my thoughts about your destiny, try my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES. Each is a 4 to 5 minute meditation about where you are right now. (For a limited time only, I've also got longer forecasts that report on the big picture of your life for 2010.)


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Hate leaves ugly scars," wrote author Mignon McLaughlin, but "love leaves beautiful ones." If I'm reading the astrological omens correctly, Aries, you're scheduled to receive at least one of the beautiful kind of scars in the coming months -- maybe even two or three. In fact, I think they'll be such lovely booboos that they will markedly add to your overall attractiveness. Rarely if ever have you been privileged to hurt as good as you will in 2010 -- thanks to the benevolent jolts of love. Happy Valentine Daze!



The horoscopes you read here may be plenty for your needs. But if you'd like to experience more of my thoughts and feelings about your current situation, you might want to try my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES. They're 4 to 5 minute meditations on the state of your life and where you're going. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Those who know how to win are much more numerous than those who know how to make proper use of their victories." So said the ancient Greek historian Polybius, and now I'm conveying the message to you. I hope it will serve as a spur in the wake of your recent triumph. Will you be content with merely basking in the glow, frittering away the provocative potentials? Or will you get down to business and use your new advantages to upgrade your destiny to what we might refer to as Aries 2.0?



I've gathered together all of your long-term, big-picture horoscopes and bundled them in one place. Click HERE to read a compendium of your forecasts for 2010. (In addition to these, I've also created EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES that go even further in exploring your destiny in 2010. Unlike the written freebies, the three-part audio reports cost money.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

 Shakespeare got modest respect while he was alive, but his reputation as a brilliant bard didn't gel right away. It wasn't until almost 50 years after he died that anyone thought his life and work were notable enough to write about. By then, all his colleagues and compatriots were gone, unable to testify. He himself left little information to build a biography around. That's why next to nothing is known about the person who made such a dramatic impact on the English language and literature. I suggest you take this as a metaphorical prod that will inspire you not to be blas√© about the greatness that is in your vicinity. Don't take superlative intelligence, talent, or love for granted. Recognize it, bless it, be influenced by it.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Philosopher David Pearce is committed to the abolition of suffering. While he acknowledges that we've got a long way to go before accomplishing that goal, he believes it's possible, mostly with the help of technology. (Read further here.) More than two millennia ago, Buddha also articulated a vision for the cessation of suffering. His methods revolve around psychological and spiritual work. In light of your current astrological omens, Aries, I think it's an excellent time to contribute to this noble enterprise. Your level of suffering is rather low these days, which could give you a natural boost if you set in motion some long-term strategies for reducing the pain that you experience and the pain that you cause.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Earth's north magnetic pole is not the same as the geographic North Pole. If you take out a compass to orient yourself toward due north, the compass arrow will actually point toward a spot in the frigid wilds of Canada. But what's really odd is that the north magnetic pole has been on the move since 1904 -- scientists don't know exactly why -- and has dramatically sped up in recent years. According to National Geographic, it's now zooming toward Siberia at the rate of almost 40 miles per year. I suspect that your own metaphorical version of magnetic north will also be changing in 2010, Aries. By January 2011, the homing signal you depend on to locate your place in reality may have migrated significantly. This is a good time to start tracking the shift.



What new influences will be headed your way in 2010? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? Would you like some guidance as you figure out how to make best use of those influences and resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic, and self-complacent is erroneous," wrote W. Somerset Maugham. "On the contrary, it makes them, for the most part, humble, tolerant, and kind." I think the trajectory of your journey during the last 12 months tends to confirm his theory, Taurus. According to my analysis, you set new benchmarks for your personal best in 2009, while at the same time becoming a wiser, riper human being. Congrats! Now get out there and capitalize on the grace you've earned. Be as organized as possible as you share the fruits of your progress.



How can you conspire with life to create the best possible future for yourself? What well-informed and ingenious approaches can you use to get the most out of the raw materials you're presented with?

Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
The Onion, which describes itself as "America's Finest News Source," ran a feature on the inventor Thomas Edison. He "changed the face of modern life in 1879," said the report, "when he devised the groundbreaking new process of taking ideas pioneered by other scientists and marketing them as his own." The tone was mocking, of course, but I'm perfectly sincere when I urge you to imitate Edison in the coming weeks. Given the current astrological omens, you'd be wise to take advantage of the breakthroughs of others and make good use of resources created by others. Just be sure that you give credit where credit is due, and you'll actually be doing everyone a service.



As you plunge in to 2010, would you like to clarify your purpose? Are there fantasies playing at the back of your mind that you'd like to bring fully into your awareness? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

A Scorpio is willing and maybe even eager to share secrets with you. Can you marshal just the right amount of self-protection -- not too much, not too little -- to trust a little more and go deeper? As for Virgo: That under-self-confident person would really benefit from getting more appreciation from you. Don't be stingy. Meanwhile, I think you're suffering from a misunderstanding about an Aquarius. It will be in your selfish interest to clear it up. A few more tips: Don't give up on Pisces. There's more to come when the coast is clearer. Browse but don't buy yet with a Leo. And make business, but not love or war, with a Capricorn.



Are you ready to shed your superstitious fears about the future? Would you like to slip into 2010 armed with an influx of confidence and poise? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I like it best when the creek that runs near my home is wide and deep. It gets that way at high tide, when the moon shepherds in a surge of water from the bay. As I gaze out at the swollen cascade, I feel full and fertile; everything's right with the world. Inevitably, though, the tide goes out and the flow turns meek and narrow. Then my mood is less likely to soar. A slight melancholy may creep in. But I've learned to love that state, too -- to derive a quiet joy from surveying the muddy banks where the water once ran, the muck imprinted with tracks of egrets and ducks. Besides, I know it's only a matter of time before the tide shifts and the cascade returns. Enjoy your own personal version of the low-tide phase, Leo. High tide will be coming back your way soon.

Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

If you asked me to make you a mix tape that would be conducive for making love to, I wouldn't be in the least surprised. These long January nights are ideal times for you Virgos to be unleashing your dormant passion and sharing volcanic pleasure and exploring the frontier where delight overlaps with wonder. In the compilation of tunes I'd create for you, I'd probably have stuff like "Teardrop" by Massive Attack, "Breathe Me" by Sia, "Supermassive Black Hole" by Muse, and "6 Underground" by the Sneaker Pimps. But I think it's a better idea for you to assemble your own soundtrack. Tell me about it if you do. I'm at [email¬†protected]



Do you understand just how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2010? Are you fully aware of just how much access you have to new resources? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Tune in!

Libra (September 23-October 22)

The world's tallest waterfall is Angel Falls in Venezuela. It was named after Jimmie Angel, an American who was the first person to fly a plane over it in 1933. Recently, Venezuela's president suggested that this place should be officially renamed Kerepakupai meru, which is what the indigenous Pemon Indians have always called it. The coming weeks happen to be a favorable time for you to consider making a comparable move, Libra: restoring a natural wonder to its original innocence; rehabilitating the truth about a beautiful resource; returning an old glory to its pristine state.

Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In the first half of 2010, your calling will be calling to you more loudly and insistently than it has in years. It will whisper to you seductively while you're falling asleep. It will clang like a salvation bell during your mid-morning breaks. It will soothe you with its serpentine tones and it will agitate you with its rippling commands to spring into action. How will you respond to these summonses from your supreme inner authority? This week will be a good test.



What hidden factors will be massaging your destiny in 2010? Could you use some hints about how to prepare for the adventures awaiting you in the next 12 months?

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"You can have it all," says fashion designer Luella Bartley. "It's just really hard work." That's my oracle for you, Sagittarius -- not just for this week, but for the next three months as well. According to my reading of the astrological omens, the cosmos will indeed permit you to have your cake and eat it, too, as long as you're willing to manage your life with more discipline, master the crucial little details everyone else neglects, and always give back at least as much as you're given.



What will be the story of your life in 2010? How can you exert your free will to create the adventures that'll bring out the best in you, even as you find graceful ways to cooperate with the tides of destiny? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Tune in!

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The number of bacteria per square inch on a toilet seat averages about 50. Meanwhile, your telephone harbors over 25,000 germs per square inch and the top of your desk has about 21,000. I'd like you to use this as a metaphor that you can apply more universally. According to my analysis, you see, you are over-emphasizing the risks and problems in one particular area of your life and underestimating them elsewhere. Spend some time this week correcting the misdiagnoses.



Do you really know how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2010? Probably not. But I'd like to help you know about that power, and tap into it. This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Tune in!

Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

One of my readers, Judd, shared his vision of how to cope with the blahs of January. Given your astrological omens, I'd say his strategy perfectly embodies the approach you should take right now. Please study his testimony below, and come up with your own ingenious variation. "On the coldest of days, my friends and I celebrate 'scrufting,' the art of enjoying the great outdoors with indoor furniture, while listening to loud indie-rock and adorned in our grungiest slop-ware. Aided by Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, we curse and laugh at the constraints of winter by playing our favorite summer sports like Frisbee, hacky-sack, and soccer."



What are your plans for the coming year? Could you use some more help mapping out your dreams and schemes? This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 and Part 2 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered the last two weeks, are still available.)

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

It's graduation time. Not in any officially recognized sense, maybe, but still: You have completed your study of a certain subject in the school of life. At a later date, maybe you will resume studying this subject on a higher level, but for now you've absorbed all you can. I suggest you give yourself a kind of final exam. (Be sure to grade it yourself.) You might also want to carry out a fun ritual to acknowledge the completion of this chapter of your story. It will free up your mind and heart to begin the next chapter.



Who do you want to become in 2010? Where do you want to go and what do you want to do? I'm ready to help you muse about the interesting possibilities. This week, my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 3 of my three-part, long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Tune in!

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to my reading of the astrological omens, it'll be a hair-on-fire kind of week for you -- and yet also a heart-in-repose kind of week. In other words, you have the potential to be fierce and relaxed, vigorously ambitious and sublimely poised. In fact, this might be one of those rare times when you can be both a justice-dispensing warrior and an enlightenment-seeking magician. Want to turn water into wine when the pressure's on? Find the pearl of great price in the heat of the battle? Feats like these are quite possible.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Can you pull off a mid-course correction while hurtling through the air across a chasm during a leap of faith? If anyone is capable of such a feat, you are. However, I'd prefer it if that wasn't necessary. I'd rather see you prepare a little better, like by procuring the help you'd need to create a safety net or sturdy bridge that will stretch across the chasm. Or by getting one of those jet packs to strap across your back and allow you to fly. Or by taking as much guesswork as possible out of the details about how you're going to get from the edge of one cliff to the edge on the other side.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

This is one of those rare times when you can get abundant access to insider secrets, unauthorized information, taboo knowledge, and forbidden wisdom. Proceed carefully. As much as I'm an advocate of you getting to the whole truth and nothing but the truth, it's also my duty to remind you that it could be disruptive to find out all of the truth in one big swoop. You should ask yourself if you're fully prepared to change what needs to be changed once the previously hidden stuff emerges. If you're not, it might be better to wait until you are.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Which metropolitan areas in America have the most brainpower? Not the best sports teams or the richest businessmen or the most powerful politicians, but the smartest people? "The Daily Beast" did a study and declared that the top two were the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina and the San Francisco Bay Area. Now it so happens that those are the two places where I've spent much of my adult life. It doesn't mean I'm brilliant, but it does suggest I have an instinct for knowing where the brilliant people congregate. And I'm quite sure that they have been a very good influence on me. My recommendation to you in 2010, Cancerian, is to cultivate this knack. Gravitate toward genius. Surround yourself with deep thinkers and innovative dreamers. Hang out in the vicinity of brainstorms.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"The more you complain," says an old adage, "the longer God lets you live." If that's true, I hope you will be adding many years to your lifespan in the coming week. Would you like to live to the age of 100? There are many rich and colorful opportunities for you to lodge protests right now. You have cosmic permission to rouse a ruckus in the name of improving the way everything works. But try to concentrate on constructive criticism that really helps transform what's stuck. The Divine Wow is more likely to give credit for that approach than for mere narcissistic grousing.



Are you ready to shed your superstitious fears about the future? Would you like to slip into 2010 armed with an influx of confidence and poise?

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

A reader calling herself Rebellioness collaborated with me to come up with five revolutionized approaches to the art of rebellion. I present them here for your use, as they identify the kinds of behavior that will be most nurturing for you to cultivate in the coming weeks. 1. Experimenting with uppity, mischievous optimism. 2. Invoking insurrectionary levels of wildly interesting generosity. 3. Indulging in an insolent refusal to be chronically fearful. 4. Pursuing a cheeky ambition to be as wide-awake as a dissident young messiah. 5. Bringing reckless levels of creative intelligence to all expressions of love.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I want to tell you about Harj, a character in Douglas Coupland's novel Generation A. He's an enterprising young Sri Lankan man who sells "celebrity room tones" over the Internet. Each hour-long recording purports to convey the sound of the silence that pervades the homes of luminaries like Mick Jagger and Cameron Diaz when they're not there. I think that you Libras are now primed to learn from Harj's example. Like him, you have the power to capitalize on nothingness and absence and emptiness.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

A guy I know broke up with his girlfriend recently. He used a time-honored strategy: making it sound as if he wasn't worthy of her. "It's like you're a grandmaster at a chess tournament," he told her, "while I just got my first checkerboard and am still figuring out how to play checkers." He was implying that she was much more skillful than he was in the arts of relationship. I have a feeling that there's a situation like this in your world, Scorpio -- an alliance in which the two parties are at different levels of maturity. I'm not necessarily saying you should sever the connection. But you should at least acknowledge the gap and decide what to do about it.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In a million years, I would never authorize you to unleash your naked greed and give it unconditional license to careen through the world gobbling and acquiring and appropriating. However, due to an odd blip in the astrological configurations, I am at liberty to give you permission to unleash your discerning, elegant greed and grant it a temporary dispensation to sample more than usual of anything that captivates your ravenous imagination.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"You are what you love, not what loves you," says the character Charlie Kaufman in the film, Adaptation. (Kaufman is played by Nicolas Cage, who has three planets in Capricorn.) I urge you to work hard to make that perspective your own, Capricorn. Ideally, it will become a permanent addition to your philosophy of life. But please at least try to install it as your primary words to live by for the next three weeks. To do so will smooth out a distortion in your energy field, making it easier for people to love you.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

I suspect you have to go down into the underworld for a while. But you have a choice about how it will play out. You shouldn't wait for some random goblin to come along and pull you down into the miserable abyss. Instead, be proactive. Shop around for a more useful abyss -- a womb-like pit with half-decent accommodations and a good learning environment -- and go there under your own power. That way you won't have to slog your way through musty fogs and creepy pests and slimy muck. You'll keep your suffering to a minimum and attract adventures that are more intriguing than demoralizing.



Do you really know how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2010? Probably not. But I'd like to help you know about that power, and tap into it.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

When my acupuncturist pushes a needle into my chest, my feet sometimes twitch involuntarily. A jab in my earlobe can cause my hand to leap off the table; when she pokes the bridge of my nose, my liver may throb. The lesson for me is that parts of the body are linked in ways that aren't obvious. I invite you to expand this principle as you use it to evaluate the interconnections between different areas of your life. How do your attitudes about love affect your ability to attract money? (And vice versa.) Are there any ways in which your capacity for happiness is affected by your political views? How do your judgments about other people impact your physical health? More than even you farseeing Pisceans imagine, everything's linked to everything.

Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Long-Range Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

One of my favorite landscape painters makes a livable wage from selling her art. She has had many gallery showings and has garnered much critical acclaim. That's the good news. The bad news is that she feels obligated to keep churning out more landscape paintings -- even when her muse nudges her to take a detour into, say, abstract expressionism or surrealistic portraits. Galleries don't want anything from her except the stuff that has made her semi-famous. "Sometimes I fantasize about creating a series of 'Sock Puppet Monkeys Playing Poker,'" she told me. If she were an Aries, I'd advise her to do what I think you should do in 2010: Listen to what your version of the sock puppet monkeys are urging you to do.



What are your plans for the coming year? Could you use some more help mapping out your dreams and schemes? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Start brainstorming about the life you want to live in the coming months.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

My Taurus friend Jill had a dream in which she stopped by a blackberry bush on a summer afternoon. All the ripe blackberries were too high on the bush, just out of reach. She stood there gazing longingly up at them for a long time. Finally three people in medieval garb came by, as if having stepped out of a deck of Tarot cards -- a warrior, magician, and priestess. "I really want those blackberries," she said to them. "Could you give me a boost?" They stooped down to make their backs available. She climbed up, but still couldn't reach the berries. "Oh well, we tried," she said. "Follow us," said the priestess, and she did. After a while they came to another bush whose blackberries were lower and easy to pluck. Then the four shared the feast. After analyzing the omens for 2010, Taurus, I've come to the conclusion that Jill's dream is an apt metaphor for your best possible destiny in 2010.



Who do you want to become in 2010? Where do you want to go and what do you want to do? I'm ready to help you muse about the interesting possibilities. This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Start imagining the big picture of your life in the coming months.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"We should not think of our past as definitely settled, for we are not a stone or a tree," wrote poet Czeslaw Milosz. "My past changes every minute according to the meaning given it now, in this moment.¬î I suggest you make abundant use of this wisdom in 2010. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you will have unprecedented power to re-vision and reinterpret your past. Keep the following question in mind as you go about your work: "How can I recreate my history so as to make my willpower stronger, my love of life more intense, and my future more interesting?"



What new influences will be headed your way in 2010? What fresh resources will you be able to draw on? Would you like some guidance as you figure out how to make best use of those influences and resources? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part one! Start imagining what's possible for you in the coming months.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I think everyone should always have an improbable quest playing at the edges of their imagination -- you know, some heroic task that provokes deep thoughts and rouses noble passions even if it also incites smoldering torment. I'm talking about an extravagant dream that's perhaps a bit farfetched but not entirely insane; a goal that constantly rouses you to stretch your possibilities and open your mind further; a wild hope whose pursuit makes you smarter and stronger even if you never fully accomplish it. The coming year would be an excellent time to keep such an adventure at the forefront of your awareness.



How can you conspire with life to create the best possible future for yourself? What well-informed and ingenious approaches can you use to get the most out of the raw materials you're presented with? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Start dreaming and scheming about the masterpiece you want to create for yourself in the coming months.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

A guy who goes by the name of "Winter" has made it his goal to visit every Starbucks in the world. According to his website, he has thus far ordered drinks in 9,874 stores. His project contrasts dramatically with an acquaintance of mine who calls herself "Indian Summer." She is in the midst of a global pilgrimage to the hundreds of sites listed in Colin Wilson's book The Atlas of Holy Places and Sacred Sites, including cave paintings, dolmens, medicine wheels, and temples. Guess which of these two explorers I'm nominating to be one of your inspirational heroes in 2010.



As you plunge in to 2010, would you like to clarify your purpose? Are there fantasies playing at the back of your mind that you'd like to bring fully into your awareness? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Start brainstorming about the life you'd like to create for yourself in the coming months.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Scientific studies have proved what we all knew already: A person who's only mildly interesting to you will probably become more attractive if you drink a couple of pints of beer. What if I told you, Virgo, that in 2010 you could regularly create the same effect without drinking the beer? I have it on good astrological authority that this will be the case. Due to fundamental shifts in your relationship with the life force, and having nothing to do with how much alcohol you consume, the entire world will often be at least 25 percent more attractive to you than it ever was before.



Are you ready to shed your superstitious fears about the future? Would you like to slip into 2010 armed with an influx of confidence and poise? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Start imagining the ways you'd like to shape the big picture of your life in the coming months.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Your limitations will be among your greatest assets in 2010. Yes, you heard me right, Libra; I'm not speaking ironically or sarcastically. During the coming months, you will be able to benefit from circumstances that you might otherwise imagine would prevent you from operating with maximum freedom. It might require you to look at the world upside-down, or work in reverse to your habitual thought patterns, but you could actually generate interesting opportunities, vital teachings, and maybe even financial gain by capitalizing on your so-called liabilities.



What if I told you that in 2010 you will have a chance to access aspects of your intelligence that have previously been dormant? How would you approach life differently if you knew you were going to be able to call on resources that have never before been available? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Start imagining all the ways you can grow and thrive in the coming months.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"Dear Rob: I sure don't like so much God stuff mixed into my horoscopes. Can you cut it out, please? I understand it's common for the masses to believe in an Ultra Being, but you? Pul-lease. You're smarter than that. I just can't abide all the 'Divine Wow' this and 'Cackling Goddess' nonsense that you dispense; it doesn't jibe with the practical, sensible, unsuperstitious, non-mushy world I hold dear. -Sally Scorpio." Dear Sally: I predict that many Scorpios will have sensational, ongoing, up-close and personal communion with the Divine Wow in 2010. You're free, of course, to call it something else, like an unprecedented eruption of creative energy or a breakthrough in your ability to access your own higher powers.



Do you understand just how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2010? Are you fully aware of just how much access you have to new resources? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Start dreaming and scheming about the life you can create for yourself in the coming months.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You Sagittarians may wander farther and wider than the other signs of the zodiac, and you may get itchier when required to stay in one place too long, but you still need a sense of belonging. Whether that comes from having a certain building where you feel comfortable or a wilderness that evokes your beloved adventurousness or a tribe that gives you a sense of community, you thrive when you're in regular touch with a homing signal that keeps you grounded. According to my analysis, 2010 will be prime time for you to find or create or renew your connection to a source that serves this purpose well.



Would you like some inspiration as you muse and wonder about your upcoming adventures in 2010? Do you long to slip out of your habitual thoughts about your life and get a more transcendent view? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Start fantasizing about the new beauty and truth you can create for yourself in the coming months.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"I am a man of fixed and unbending principles," said American politician Everett Dirksen, "the first of which is to be flexible at all times." That's the kind of playful and resilient spirit I urge you to aspire to in 2010, Capricorn. I think you're most likely to have a successful year if you regularly explore the joys of improvisation. The more empirical and less theory-bound you're willing to be, the better you'll feel. Practicing the art of compromise doesn't have to be galling, I promise you; it may even turn out to be more fun and educational than you imagined possible.



What hidden factors will be massaging your destiny in 2010? Could you use some hints about how to prepare for the adventures awaiting you in the next 12 months? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Get started on creating a master plan for the coming months.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Who and what do you hold most dear, Aquarius? I encourage you to get clear about that. Once you do, I hope you'll make a vow to bestow extra care and attention on them in 2010 -- I mean literally write out a one-page oath in which you describe the inner states you will cultivate in yourself while you're in their presence and the specific actions you're going to take to help them thrive.  Nothing else you do will be more important to your success in 2010.



What will be the story of your life in 2010? How can you exert your free will to create the adventures that'll bring out the best in you, even as you find graceful ways to cooperate with the tides of destiny? This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Start plotting a course to put yourself in alignment with your highest purpose in the coming months.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The philosopher Nietzsche said there was no middle ground: You either said "yes" to life or you said "no." You either celebrated your vitality, enjoyed your power, and thrived on challenges, or else you practiced constant self-denial, hemmed yourself in with deluded rationalizations, and tormented yourself with indecision. I'm not so sure it's always as clear-cut as that. While I'm usually in the "yes to life" camp," I've gone through "no to life" phases, as well as some extended "maybe to life" times. What about you, Pisces? Whatever you've done in the past, I hope that in 2010 you will take maximum advantage of the cosmic rhythms, which will be encouraging you to give life a big, resounding, ongoing YES.



Do you really know how much power you have to create the life you want to live in 2010? Probably not. But I'd like to help you know about that power, and tap into it. This week and the next two weeks, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2010. Each part of this three-part report is between 6 and 10 minutes long. Tune in to Part One! Supercharge the process of becoming the person you were born to be.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What influences do you really, really need to say goodbye to? The next six months will provide you with ample motivation and opportunity to finally bid those farewells. What long-term cycle really, really needs to be drawn to a close, no more hemming and hawing, all loose ends tied up and all mixed signals clarified? Again, the time between now and the middle of June will bring you the necessary inspiration to make it happen. But it'll take deep thought and sustained work and an expanded sense of humor, so get started soon.



This week my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES offer you a teaser look at some of the major themes you will be working and playing with in 2010. Then, beginning December 29, I will devote three consecutive weeks of EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES to an in-depth discussion of your long-range outlook for the coming 12 months. Tune in!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I don't understand why the astronomers responsible for naming new-found objects are so devoid of flair. Here's a prime example: They found a blazar, or blazing quasi-stellar object, in a faraway galaxy. It's powered by a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion times larger than our sun. Why did they give this fantastic oddity the crushingly boring name "Q0906+6930"? Couldn't they have called it something like "Queen Anastasia" or "Blessed Quasimodo" or "Gastromopolopolis"? I trust you won't be as lazy in your approach to all the exotic discoveries you're going to be making in 2010, Aries. Start getting your imagination in top shape. Make sure it's primed and ready for your upcoming walkabout to the far reaches of reality.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Indignation is one of the most rewarding of emotions," writes Theodore Dalrymple, "as well as one that automatically gives meaning to life . . . There is nothing like irritation to get the juices circulating and the mind working." Of all the ideas that have made me irritable and indignant in recent weeks, this one steams me the most. I disagree so completely that I am practically beside myself with paralyzing rage. And as I plunge my attention further and further into his ridiculous proposal, I feel the tension coursing through my body. I sense my mind becoming swampy, my perceptions distorted. There's a good chance that I am inducing in myself a state of stressed-out stupidity. Please don't follow my example, Aries. It's possible that sour fury could be useful to you at other times, but right now you should avoid it. If you want your intelligence to work at peak efficiency in the coming days, you'll need long stretches of tender, lucid calm.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When Carolee Schneeman was a kid, her extravagant adoration of nature earned her the nickname "mad pantheist." Later, during her career as a visual artist, she described her relationship with the world this way: "I assume the senses crave sources of maximum information, that the eye benefits by exercise, stretch, and expansion towards materials of complexity and substance." I hope that you're attracted to that perspective right now, Aries. To be in most productive alignment with the cosmic rhythms, you should be in a state of nearly ecstatic openness, hungry to be stretched -- like a mad pantheist.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

One of the greatest superpowers a human being can have is the ability to change herself in accordance with her intentions. Let's say you're tired of feeling shame about something there's no good reason to feel shame about, and you decide to do whatever it takes to dissolve that shame, and you succeed in doing it. Or let's say you no longer want to attract bad listeners and flaky collaborators into your life, and you resolve to transform that pattern, and you ultimately achieve your goal. These are acts of high magic, as amazingly wizardly as anything a shaman does. It so happens, Aries, that this superpower is especially accessible to you right now.



Need more whacks applied to your mental blocks? More caresses bestowed upon your growing edge? Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"A chief event of life is the day in which we have encountered a mind that startled us," wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. My wish for you, Aries, is that you will have many such days in the coming weeks. In fact, I hope that you will be blessed over and over again with the hair-raising thrill of having your imagination pricked, causing it to half-blossom, half-explode. To get the most out of the fantastic possibilities, set aside any tendency you might have to be a know-it-all, and instead open up your heart's mind and your mind's heart as wide and deep as they will go.



To further explore the ripening challenges and blessings in your life, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A whitewash happens when you use deceit to cover up the messy facts about a situation. A blackwash is just the opposite: It's when you invoke candor as you reveal complications that have previously been veiled. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, the coming weeks will be prime time to enjoy a jubilee of blackwashing. But I suggest that you proceed gently. Remember that not all hidden information is a sign of malfeasance or evil intentions. Sometimes the truth is so paradoxical and nuanced, it's hard to get it completely out in the open all at once. And sometimes people are motivated to keep things secret mostly because they're afraid to cause pain.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

There was a time when wetlands were considered dismal and unproductive. At best they were thought to be a waste of space, and at worst stinky breeding grounds for insect pests. For over 200 years, many marshes, bogs, and swamps were filled with dirt and transformed into places suitable for farms, houses, and recreational areas. But all that has changed in the last 30 years. Science has rehabilitated the reputation of wetlands, showing how crucial they are. They clean toxins from water, help control floods and soil erosion, and are home to more biological diversity than any other ecosystem. The coming weeks would be an excellent time for you to make a comparable conversion, Aries. Something you once demeaned or underestimated could become an inspirational catalyst.



It's possible my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for you could give you additional help in figuring out what's going on. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You may be as flooded with briny emotion as a Pisces on a meandering binge. You might be as embedded in a labyrinth of your own creation as the Geminis who verge on being too clever for their own good. You may be as cagey a listener as a Scorpio who's searching for a hidden vulnerability in an ally. In other words, Aries, you're not exactly yourself. But it's one of those rare times when that's a good thing. Halloween costume suggestion: the opposite of what you think you are.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"The clouds are the most fertile part of the sky," writes Guy Murchie in his book The Seven Mysteries of Life. Microbes with short life cycles live there in abundance, "eating, breathing, excreting, floating, swimming, competing, reproducing." Next time you look up at a puffy cumulus, see it as a large city that hosts a teeming host of living things. Speaking of invisible fecundity, let's turn our attention to you. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you are largely unaware of how much creative energy has been building up within you. Your homework is to tap into it and unleash it.



For more help in understanding your relationship with the game of life, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You say you not only want to be loved, but that you also want to love? Then learn the fantasies and symbols and beliefs that hold people's lives together. Be interested in feeling the crushing weight and deep comfort of their web of memories. Every now and then, dive in and swim along in their stream of consciousness. And yes, be willing to accompany them when they're writhing in their personal hells as well as when they're exploring the suburbs of paradise. All these tasks will be exceptionally worthy of your time in the coming weeks, Aries.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The poet Stephen Mallarme wrote the following in a letter to a friend: "I don't know which of my internal climates I should explore in order to find you and meet you." I love that passage. It alludes to one of the central facts about the nature of reality: The quality of your consciousness is crucial in determining whether you'll be able to attract the resources that are essential to your dreams coming true. In order to get what you want, you have to work on yourself at least as hard as you work on the world around you. This is always true, of course, but it's especially true for you now, Aries. 



What better adventure is there than understanding your unique destiny? For more hints, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Is the electron a wave or a particle? Physicists had to conduct thousands of experiments to arrive at the definitive answer, which is that it's both. In other words, the solution to one of the fundamental questions about the nature of reality is a paradox. I think this strongly suggests that the correct response to many other riddles about the ultimate truth might be two seemingly opposing explanations. Could the Unitarians and Buddhists both be right? Socialists and capitalists? Mystics and scientists? In the upcoming days, Aries, you will be offered lots of practice in adopting this approach as you deal with a personal dilemma that's very much akin to "Is the electron a wave or a particle?"



No one knows you better than you do, but maybe I can help you dig up even more self-knowledge. Listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Jonathan Lee Riches is renowned for filing numerous lawsuits in U.S courts. Some of his targets are actual living people, like Martha Stewart, George W. Bush, and Steve Jobs. But he has also gone after defendants like Nostradamus, Che Guevara, the Eiffel Tower, the ex-planet Pluto, the Holy Grail, the Appalachian Trail, and the Garden of Eden. This would be a good time for you to draw inspiration from his example. I don't mean that you should become a litigious fanatic, but rather that you should seek redress and vindication from those people, places, and things that have not had your highest interests in mind. This could take the form of a humorous message, a compassionate prank, or an odd gift. Remember, too, that old saying: Success is the best revenge.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To the thug who stole my Chevy Malibu from its parking place while I was recording an album in San Francisco back in 1991: I forgive you. To the lovely and talented Artemisia, who couldn't bring herself to fall in love with me as we partied at the Burning Man festival back in 2001: I forgive you. To the agent who helped my writing career so much but also cheated me out of thousands of dollars: I forgive you. To any Aries readers who hate it when I refer to my personal life in their horoscopes, and would much rather I confine myself to talking about them: I forgive you, and recommend that you engage in a more thorough and profound version of the cleansing I just illustrated.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I don't think I'm being unduly optimistic when I speculate that you're on the verge of achieving a ringing victory over your bad self. What makes me so confident that this development is in the works? Well, in recent weeks you have been dealing more forthrightly and intelligently with the lowest aspects of your character. You have also become more fully aware of the difference between your out-and-out unregenerate qualities and the unripe aspects of your character that may someday become very beautiful. There's a second sign that you're close to transforming one of the most negative things about you: You have almost figured out the truth about a murky curse that you internalized some time ago. When you finally identify it, you will know intuitively how to banish it forever.



Where do you want to go? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

I expect that you'll be a force of nature in the coming days, the human equivalent of a divine intervention. In fact, you might want to give fair warning to friends and loved ones who assume that you have always been and will always be steady, placid, and mild. Otherwise they may be unduly freaked out when your intelligence explodes like a double rainbow or when you start emoting like a waterfall. They might accuse you of "not being yourself" when your laughter turns volcanic or your decisions hit with the force of the aurora borealis. It'll be interesting for you to notice which of your close cohorts responds most favorably to this outbreak of your elemental gifts.



MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO TELL ME THAT I SHOULD DO A RADIO SHOW. She thought I had the kind of voice that people naturally feel comfortable with. You can be the judge of that if you listen to me expound upon your destiny in my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead. It's a different experience from reading this written horoscope on my website.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"Here's what I did not do this summer," begins the testimony of one of my Gemini readers, Beth Hylton. "Not once did I swing on a tire swing over the river, watching the pink shimmery reflection of myself in a wet suit on a tire swing. I did not take a day off work to sneak out alone to Jones Beach with a book and a beer in a ginger ale bottle. I did not eat outside at a red-checkered-tablecloth-and-too-much-cheese-on-the-pasta Italian restaurant, sucking back carafes of Gallo like Kool-Aid. I did not catch fireflies for the satisfaction of setting them free, and I did not nap in the noontime sun. Where are all the 'I dids'?" I'm happy to inform Beth, as well as any of her fellow Geminis who might have been remiss in doing the kinds of activities she named, that the next three weeks will be a very favorable period to make up for lost time.



Here's what M. Tennenbaum of New York had to say about the experience of listening to my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES: "Your Expanded Audio Horoscopes provide me with the Rest of the Story. I'm not necessarily a believer in the scientific accuracy of astrology, but I do think you've got a lot of practical wisdom to impart."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Murmurs and whispers will have more clout than clamors and shouts. A candle in the dark will provide more illumination than a bonfire at high noon. Short jaunts could transform everything permanently; long trips might only shift things slightly and temporarily. Forceful confrontations may lead to a muddle; feints and tricks and bluffs could spark crafty solutions. The "simple facts" will probably be tainted by lies of omission; the messy contradictions are likely to be eminently trustworthy.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

KFC is test-marketing a flamboyant new menu item at selected restaurants in the U.S. This remarkable delicacy is an exotic sandwich that consists of bacon, two servings of cheese, and special sauce, all held together not by bread but by two slabs of fried chicken. I nominate this spectacular creation to be your earthy metaphor of the week. In accordance with the astrological omens, I hope it inspires you to head out to the frontiers of extravagance in both your spiritual affairs and your romantic life. The coming days will be an ideal time to pray to both Christ and the Goddess while making love, for example, or to get sandwiched between two delicious devotees while meditating naked, or to perform a boisterous ritual to invoke emotional riches with the help of a genius of love.



Here's what R. Goren of Albuquerque had to say about the experience of listening to my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES: "No one knows more about me than me. But you're right up there near the top of the list of people who do understand something about how I tick. How is that possible?"

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

It's Build Up Your Confidence by Any Means Possible Week -- for Virgos only. During this holiday, you have an astrological mandate as well as a poetic license to pluck the easy victories. So go ahead and solve the kinds of riddles that are your specialty. Arrange to be in situations where your perspective is desperately needed. Put yourself in the presence of people who think you're a gift to the human race, and subtly encourage your secret admirers to be less secretive. If you have any trophies or awards, make them more visible. There's no shame in bragging this week, Virgo, but for best results do it with your best understated elegance.



Got enough clues to chew on for a while? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

My first demand is that you weed out the wishy-washy wishes and lukewarm longings that keep you distracted from your burning desires. My second demand is that you refuse to think that anyone else knows better than you what dreams will keep your life energy humming with maximum efficiency and beauty. Now please repeat the following assertions about 20 times: "I know exactly what I want. I know exactly what I don't want. I know exactly what I kind of want but I won't waste my time on it any more because it sidetracks me from working on what I really really want." 



Here's what Ari S. of Ann Arbor, MI had to say about the experience of listening to my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES: "Your expanded horoscopes get more personal and intimate with me than some of my closest friends. Thanks for the loving reflections."

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Ants may literally be crawling in your pants as you pull off a savvy coup or a brilliant stroke. An annoying pest may try to distract you at about the same time that movers and shakers are tuning in to your magnificence. But I don't mean to imply that minor irritants will undermine your victories. I think you're too unbeatable for that to happen. At worst, you'll have a mild headache as you receive your reward or stumble slightly as you stride into the spotlight.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"That which can be destroyed by the truth should be," wrote author P. C. Hodgell. I wish there were a gentler way to articulate that wisdom, but I can't think of one. Instead I'll suggest a way to apply it so as to make the end result more graceful than shocking: Don't pour out the whole truth all at once in one big dramatic gesture. Do it gradually and tenderly. As you do, keep in mind that when the truth has finally dismantled the thing that could not endure the truth, you may be able to use the debris as raw material to build something new that the truth will feel right at home in.



Here's what Teresa F. of Boston had to say about the experience of listening to my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES: "Your audio 'scopes have a knack for waking me up from whatever random dream has sneaked into my brain and rendered me half-blind."

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

What if a billion Chinese people jumped up into the air at the same exact moment? Would they create, at the moment they landed, a shockwave that would cause an earthquake on the opposite side of the world, in Chile and Argentina? No one knows. I'd like to propose a not unsimilar but more interesting experiment. What if every Capricorn who reads this horoscope reserves one minute at exactly 1 pm EDT on September 12, and during that time you all meditate intently on a single glowing thought, which is this: All of you Capricorns deserve an act of uncanny grace that will help free you from one of your most oppressive beliefs.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Some rare people, through heroic acts of will and the help of a really good imagination, manage to free themselves pretty thoroughly from the inertia of their past. This accomplishment is more possible for you right now than it has been in a long time. In fact, you could even overcome a negative legacy that made some of your ancestors crazy and sick. For maybe just the third time ever, you're in a position to escape the sins of the fathers and the flaws of the mothers!



Here's what Alyssa R. of Des Moines, Iowa had to say about the experience of listening to my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES: "Your expanded audio horoscopes are the next best thing to actually having you here next to me to remind me who I really am."


Pisces (February 19-March 20)

If you build it, they will probably come. If you just pretend to build it, they may come anyway, and end up sticking around because of your charming attunement to life's deeper rhythms. If, as you build it or pretend to build it, you act manic or send out mixed messages, they may be intrigued and attracted, but they definitely won't come. So my advice, Pisces, is to suppress your mood swings as you at least start pretending to build the thing in earnest.



Here's what Alex D., Los Angeles had to say about the experience of listening to my EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES: "When I listen to your audio 'scopes, my free will lights up."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your assignment is to get angry in the most unique, brilliant, and constructive way possible. Merely being annoyed and muttering generic curses will definitely not be sufficient. Nor will it work for you to get consumed in knee-jerk rage or to be peeved about the same old boring targets that everyone reacts to. What the cosmos needs from you this week, Aries, is a controlled explosion of liberated, compassionate, laser-sharp fury that will fuel your ingenious drive to change everything for the better.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Are you having intense cravings for candy? Do you find yourself leaning in the direction of sappy emotions and syrupy words? That's what my astrological projections suggest. And if that's indeed the case, I'd like to steer you in a different direction. It's not that an extravagant involvement in chocolate and sentimentality is wrong or bad. But what you truly need, in my opinion, is a more muscular, provocative sweetness. A wilder, more vibrant sweetness. A sweetness that can smash obstacles and incite high magic.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I won't protest if you try to conceal yourself from bullies or gossips or critics or narcissists. You have cosmic permission to hunker down and keep a low profile. But please don't hide from yourself. In fact, I encourage you to make yourself extra available to yourself. Listen respectfully to the questions and comments that your shadow murmurs in your inner ear. Be eager to tune in to the messages your body is longing to tell you. These communications might sometimes be a minor pain in the ego, but the long-term benefits to your soul could be substantial.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I have tuned in to your yearning for resolution, O Seeker. I know that your heart fervently wants the riddles to run their course, the mysteries to be revealed, the uncertainties to be quelled. And I have ransacked my imagination in search of what consolation I might provide to appease your quest for neat, simple truths. But what I have concluded, O In-Between One, is that any solutions I might try to offer you would not only be fake, but also counterproductive. What you actually need, I suspect, are not answers to your urgent questions, but rather, better questions; more precisely formulated questions; more ruthlessly honest questions. Dig deeper, please. Open wider. Think fatter.

No one knew there was coal in the United States until 1790. A hunter who was wandering near Pennsylvania's Broad Mountain stumbled upon it accidentally when his campfire lit up an outcropping of pure anthracite. That discovery was both a blessing and a curse; since then, the mining of coal has yielded abundant energy but also environmental degradation. I predict a metaphorically similar event for you in the coming days, Leo. You will inadvertently find a potentially enormous source of valuable fuel that will, like coal, present you with both rich opportunities and knotty dilemmas.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I dare you to say yes to a possibility you've said no to in the past. I double dare you to try an impossible thing before lunch each day. I triple dare you to imagine you're a genius at inspiring people to like you and help you. I quadruple dare you to drive overly stable people crazy for all the right reasons. I quintuple dare you to fantasize that your so-called delusions of grandeur have begun to contain more than a few grains of truth.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I know a 19-year-old woman who has been going through an especially vivid phase of living on the edge between yes and no. She told me that yesterday morning she woke up with the feeling that in the next 12 hours she could either commit suicide or else perform some epic deed in which she surpassed all of her previous limits. She chose the latter path, completing an 18-mile bike ride that tested her endurance and drove her into the heights of exhilaration. As she pedaled, she drove herself onward with the throbbing thought that this was a perfect way to silence the self-destructive voice within her. I offer her victory to you, Libra, as being worthy of imitation.

Let's take inventory of your harvest, Scorpio. What blossomed for you these past months? Which of the seeds you planted last March and April sprouted into ripe, succulent blossoms? Which seeds grew into hard, spiky clumps? And what about weeds, pests, and predators? Were you tireless about keeping them away from your beauties? Finally, what did you learn about growing things that could give you a green thumb when you cultivate your seeds in the next cycle?

Before she became a rock goddess, Gwen Stefani cleaned the floors at an ice cream parlor. Prior to ascending to stardom, Ellen DeGeneres was an oyster shucker, Keanu Reeves worked a janitor, and Brad Pitt performed as a giant chicken mascot. As for me, my gig as an internationally syndicated astrologer was not my first. Among many other things, I washed enough pots and pans in cheap restaurants to fulfill my dishwashing karma for my next five incarnations. I hope these examples serve to inspire you, Sagittarius. Even during the down economy, the next six months will provide you with ripe astrological conditions for upgrading your job. And the coming weeks will be prime time to brainstorm about how to go about it.

I know some brave pioneers who make responsible use of psychotropic drugs as they map out the borderlands of consciousness. I'm glad they're doing that work, but my path is different. I don't indulge in marijuana, LSD, ayahuasca, or psilocybin. However, my many years of doing meditation, dream work, and various spiritual practices have nevertheless transformed me into a radical mystic with some of the same knowledge that the psychedelic experimenters have. Keep that disclaimer in mind as you ruminate on my advice for you, which is this: Blow your own mind, baby. Raise your expectations, supercharge your fantasy life, and make forays out into the frontiers. Get high in ways that are appropriate to your ethical code.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

I love the new neighborhood I just moved to. It's insanely eclectic. Modern suburban-like homes with impeccable emerald-green lawns stand right next door to bedraggled 1950s-style ranch houses with unfinished plywood for garage doors and high brown weeds blanketing the front yards. A rusty mustard-yellow 1977 Cadillac Seville sporting a McCain-Palin bumper sticker is parked on the street next to a shiny 2007 Volvo with a sticker that advises, "Be the change you want to see in the world." Aging rednecks with fishing gear scattered in the driveway live next door to hipster musicians who blast psychedelic folk songs from their garage rehearsal space. I urge you to hang out in places like this in the coming weeks: where diversity rules, where the pigeonholes are exploded, where variety is not just the spice of life but the main course.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The month of August brought you some peculiar advances. You got a reward that didn't mean as much to you as it might have had you received it earlier. You outgrew an enigma that had puzzled and frustrated you forever. And you finally wriggled free of a shadowy game that you had been attached to long after it lost its power to educate you. As curious as these wistful breakthroughs have been, they are prologue to what's headed your way. Get ready to solve a problem you didn't even know you loved.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What I wish for you this week is that you won't be satisfied with mediocre truths; that you'll be a fussy perfectionist focused on cutting out waste, fraud, and delusion; that you'll be itchy to know more about the unacknowledged games that are being played. Frustration, I hope, will be your holy fuel. Unsweetened lemonade, I trust, will be your rejuvenating drink. These are blessings, Aries, not curses! I pray that you'll pick one of your scabs until it bleeds so the healing process can start over -- the right way this time.

What have you always wanted to yell from the pinnacle of the hill in the distance? This is the week to go there and yell it. What is that safe way of getting high that you've always wanted to try but never had the time for before? This is the week to try it. What is the alluring phenomenon that is always going on just outside the reach of your ordinary awareness -- the seductive pull you have always somehow resisted? This is the time to dive in and explore it. (Thanks to John Averill for his inspiration in composing this horoscope. His tweets are here.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden because of an incident involving an apple, right? Wrong. Many biblical scholars suspect the fruit in question was either a fig, grape, or pomegranate. I mention this, Gemini, because I think you'd be wise to review your own personal myth of exile. It's time to question the story you have been telling yourself about how your paradise got lost. Evidence you discover in the coming days just might suggest that everything you've believed is at least half-wrong -- that your origins are different from what you imagine. And as for the forbidden fruit that supposedly led you astray: You may realize that it was actually a precious medicine.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The coming week will be prime time to perform minor miracles without trying too hard. You'll probably have maximum success if you refrain from hoping and worrying about achieving maximum success. The cosmic currents will be likely to bend and shape themselves to accommodate your deeper needs if you proceed on the assumption that they know, better than your little ego does, what's best for you.

Are you familiar with the phenomenon known as a fire whirl? It happens on rare occasions when a fire produces a tornado-like vortex that rises up vertically, spinning madly. It's beautiful to behold but is not something you ever want to be close to. I bring this to your attention in the hope that you will not let yourself turn into the human equivalent of a fire whirl in the coming week. You're not yet close to being one, but there are signs you're headed that way. With just a modicum of adjustment, you can ensure that you'll be more like a blaze in a fireplace or a wild but controlled bonfire on a beach -- not a fire whirl.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I was listening to a sports talk show on the radio. The host had recently discovered Twitter, and was pleased with how many fans he had already accumulated. But he was not at all happy with the words "Twitter" or "tweet." Too effeminate, he said. Not macho enough for a he-man like himself to use comfortably. In fact, he promised that he would never again refer to his Twitter messages as "tweets," but would hereafter call them "spurts." Instead of "Twitter," he would say "Twister." I encourage you to draw inspiration from his example, Virgo. You're in an astrological phase when you can and should reconfigure anything that doesn't suit your needs or accommodate your spirit, whether it's the language you use, the environments you hang out in, or the processes you're working on.

Years ago, a TV sitcom called The Andy Griffith Show ran for seven seasons on CBS. Its star, Any Griffith, played a mild-mannered sheriff in a small town in North Carolina. His sidekick was Barney Fife, a bumbling deputy with a sweet disposition. Shortly after he left the show, Griffith had a dream in which he thrashed and pummeled his co-star. When he asked his psychiatrist about the meaning of this dream violence, the shrink speculated that he was trying to kill off his old image. I recommend that exact strategy to you now, Libra. Don't actually wreak any real-life mayhem. Rather, see if you can have a dream or two in which you destroy a symbol of the life you're ready to leave behind.

What life will you be living at noon on September 1, 2014? Who will you be? How thoroughly will your dreams have come true?  What kind of beauty and truth and love and justice will you be serving? Will you look back at the time between August 27 and September 21, 2009 and sigh, "If only I had initiated my Five Year Master Plan at that ripe astrological moment"? Or on September 1, 2014 will you instead be able to crow, "I can truly say that in these past five years I have become the president of my own life"?

If at some future time you sell your life story to a filmmaker who makes it into a feature film, it may have a lot to do with adventures that kick into high gear in the coming weeks. The fun will start (I hope) when you decide not to merely lie back and be victimized by your signature pain any longer. This brave act will recalibrate the cosmic scales and shift the currents of destiny that flow through you. Soon you will be making progress in untangling a mystery that has eluded your insight for a long time. You will be able to uncover the guarded secrets of a source that has for some time been tweaking your personal power without your full awareness.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In his book From Heaven to Earth: Spiritual Living in a Market-Oriented World, Aaron Zerah riffs on the Hebrew word "nabal." It describes someone who's so staunchly concentrated on practical concerns that he becomes impractical. Please don't let this be your fate anytime soon, Capricorn. For the ultimate benefit of the bottom line, disregard the bottom line for a while. Fantasize like a teenage poet. Be as whimsical as a mystic clown. Be a sweet, fun-loving fool so you won't turn into a sour, workaholic fool.

A woman living in China's Jilin province got married in a wedding gown with a train that was 1.4 miles long. Lin Rong's dress was decorated with 9,999 red silk roses and took three months to sew. In the spirit of her record-breaking ritual, Aquarius I encourage you to be extravagant and imaginative as you celebrate a great union in the coming weeks. You have an astrological mandate to think big as you carry out a rite of passage that will lead to an upgrade in the role that collaboration and symbiosis play in your life.

Close your eyes and imagine you're in a meadow as rain falls. Inhale the aroma of the earth as the ground is soaked. Dwell in the midst of that scent for a while, allowing it to permeate your organs and nerves. Feel its life-giving energy circulating through you. Give yourself to the memories it evokes. In my astrological opinion, experiences like this are what you need most in the coming week. Can you think of some others that would speak directly to your animal intelligence? It's a perfect time to please and excite the part of you that is a soft, warm creature.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Maybe you weren't listened to very attentively as a child. Perhaps you were dressed in clothes you didn't like, hugged only three times a year, and fed food you were allergic to. I suppose it's even possible that your parents were psychotic drug dealers who kept you chained to a radiator in their squalid basement. If that's the case, Aries, I would understand if you had an urge to devote the next three decades to bewailing your bitter past and scheming up ways to wreak revenge on the cruel world. But if you have ever been curious about whether there might be better ways to allocate your time and energy, I have good news. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you now have it in your power to overcome your toughest memories and set out on a course to become almost as secure as if those bad things had never happened.

Let's say you're listening to your favorite band on a stereo system. There is a place between the two speakers where you will hear the two streams of music blend perfectly, exactly as the sound engineer intended. This place is called the sweet spot. If you play tennis or baseball, you know about another version of the term "sweet spot." It's the area on the racquet or the bat where you get best results when striking the ball. According to my astrological analysis, Taurus, this will be your ruling metaphor for the next three weeks. You have arrived at your very own sweet spot -- the embodiment of all that is melodious, graceful, delicious, aromatic, and effective.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Squirrels often bury the nuts they find, intending to come back and retrieve their bounty at a later time. The only trouble is, they sometimes forget where their hiding places are, and the nuts go uneaten. This, at least, is the story told by children's book writer Beatrice Potter, and I regard her as an authority on such matters. I bring this to your attention, Gemini, because you're entering a phase when it will be wise for you to track down and accumulate extra reserves of a prime resource. As you do, make sure you remember all the pertinent details that will allow you to fully access them when you need them in the future.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

For better or worse, you are at least temporarily becoming more psychic. It could be a blessing, or it might be a bit of a burden. You may really enjoy having an enhanced ability to tune in to what people are thinking and feeling, and it could prove eminently useful. Knowing what's *really* on everyone's mind might give you a significant edge as you work to turn grand fantasies into well-grounded realities. But it also might tax your empathy or tempt you to ignore boundaries that should be upheld. I hope that by informing you of this situation, I have made it far more likely that your higher sensitivity will be a gift instead of a glitch.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Your strategies are very close to working. The results you've generated so far are almost useful, bordering on successful, and on the brink of being beautiful. My question now is: You won't stop here, will you? You've already garnered a measure of recognition. You've gotten a taste of victory over your old bugaboos. Will you be satisfied with these partial breakthroughs, or will you fight and kick and scratch to strip away the almosts and ascend to utter triumph?

No more rotten dessert, Virgo. No more silky danger or juicy poison. No more worthless treasures or empty successes or idiotic brilliance. Soon all those crazy-making experiences will be gone, blasted, dead. By this time next week, the bad influences that were trying to pass themselves off as good influences will have fallen away in response to your courageous drive for authenticity. You will be primed to restore your innocence and play in places where purity is the rule, not the exception. Already, the wisdom of your wild heart is regenerating, giving you the strength to overthrow the sour, life-hating influences that were threatening to smother your spirit.

An epic treasure hunt will soon begin. Are you ready for it? I don't think you are. To get yourself in shape to perform at a high level, I suggest that you open your mind wider than you ever have before. The clues that will be most helpful won't resemble any clues you've ever valued in the past, and they'll be arriving from unforeseen sources. I'll give you a hint about what to look for in the early going of the quest for the magic boon: What circumstance in your life has a certain metaphorical similarity to a speakeasy during the time when alcohol sales were illegal in America?

It's not a favorable moment to get your honey's name tattooed on your forearm. Maybe in November, but not now. On the other hand, it's an excellent time to determine whether your lover is willing to have your name tattooed on his or her forearm. In the coming weeks, I also encourage you to figure out which of your allies would give you half of their fudge brownie and which wouldn't; which authority figures would be inclined to give you precisely what you want rather than see you walk out of their lives; and which of your associates are too jealous of you to be truly helpful. Be cagey about how you apply the tests, Scorpio. See if you can subtly gauge where everyone stands in relationship to you.

I'd like to discuss The Game. Do you know what I mean? I'm talking about The Unnamed Game. The Uber-Game that is so vast and all-encompassing that it's virtually a secret. What if you discovered that one of the seemingly sacrosanct rules of The Game was really just a local ordinance, and no longer applied if you played in a different arena or at a higher level? And what if I said that in this different arena or higher level, new allies are poised to introduce you to loopholes and shortcuts you never imagined existed?

I think you've been lurking and slinking long enough, Capricorn. For now, you've learned all you need to know about wrestling with camouflage and subterfuge. You've done all you could to clean up the crooked places and bring integrity to the twisted stories. Now it's high time for you to come out and play -- to exit the claustrophobic maze and make a break for wide-open spaces. Some cautionary advice: To keep from getting pinched by trick endings, make sure all sales are final and all goodbyes are complete.

Technically, this would be an excellent time to shuck all your responsibilities and plunge into a week-long bacchanalia, complete with rowdy feasting and delirious dancing and lunatic laughter and erotic abandon and mind-altering emotions. Realistically, though, while such an interlude might do wonders for your relationship with yourself, it could dampen your relationships with people who rely on you. Unless of course you could coax them into joining you on your binge.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Did you ever notice that some people seem to be addicted to falling in love over and over again? While they may truly have a natural propensity to exult in the beauty of a great variety of their fellow humans, I also suspect that their addiction serves as an excuse for them to fall in love with themselves over and over again. At least in part, each new romantic partner is a pawn in their strategy for coming back home to themselves. Here's what I'm inclined to ask these people: Why not simply eliminate the middleman or middlewoman? I'm not necessarily implying that you'll benefit from this advice right now, Pisces. But then why did a soft, lulling voice in my head just suggest that I tell it to you?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I started producing some good work within ten years of launching my writing career, but I didn't hit my stride until the 18th year. From what I hear, many other skills require a long training period as well. According to an Aikido adept I know, for example, a practitioner may require 30 years to master the moves and spirit of that martial art. And as for the ability to carry on a successful intimate relationship: It usually takes a lifetime. I hope this line of thinking helps you get a more practical perspective on the specific prowess you're trying to develop, Aries. Keep in mind that it probably wouldn't be worth learning if you could become a wizard in a flash. There's no rush. Give yourself credit for how far you've come already.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Talk to yourself more and better. Not just with streams of chatter that meander aimlessly. Not with darts of self-deprecation mixed in with grandiose fantasies. No, Taurus. When I urge you to talk to yourself more and better, I mean that you should address your self with focused tenderness. I mean that you should be driven by the bold intention to lift up your mood, praise your skills, shower blessings on your vulnerabilities, and love yourself down to the core. You will attract cosmic assistance if you do this playful work. You will bathe your subconscious intelligence with healing luminosity.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I climbed the endless steps to the sanctuary, brushing off large spiders that kept landing on me. I stood in the rain for hours waiting for the gates to open. The guardian of the threshold wouldn't let me in until I answered his tricky and sometimes insulting questions. Through it all, I maintained my patience and poise and reverence. At no time did I give in to the temptation to curse the difficulties. And when I finally entered, when I got my chance to penetrate to the heart of the rose petal-strewn labyrinth, my persistence was rewarded. As I knelt there in amused awe, face to face with the sacred jokester, I got a useful answer to the most important question in my life. Would you like a comparable experience, Gemini? It's possible in the coming week.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Visionary philosopher Buckminster Fuller said that "Pollution is nothing but resources we're not harvesting." If that's true, Cancerian, you've got a lot of resources available to you right now, although they will have to be converted from their smoggy and effluvial state. So for example, if you're a songwriter, the noxious emotions floating around could be raw material for a sparkling tune. If you're a lover, the peculiar vibes you're dealing with could inspire you to prevent a dumb pattern from repeating itself.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

The monsoon rains have not blessed eastern India with their usual downpours this year. In response, frustrated farmers have resorted to a radical ritual: asking their unmarried daughters to get naked and plow the fields. They believe that this will embarrass the weather gods into acting correctly. In general, I approve of being creative in making appeals to deities, but I recommend that you use a different approach. Rather than shaming them into providing you with more love and mojo, try flattering them. As if you were celebrating Halloween early, go around impersonating a god or goddess who is overflowing with love and mojo.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Two annoyances that had been bugging you before your exile have been neutralized. But you've still got at least one more to go, so don't relax yet. In fact, I think you should redouble your vigilance. Check expiration dates on your poetic licenses and pet theories. Scrub the muck from your aura, even if your friends seem to find it "interesting." And learn to read your own mind better so you can track down any disabling thoughts that might still be lurking in remote corners.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Your upcoming adventures will probably make no sense -- unless you redefine what constitutes "sense." If you do that, your adventures could make absolutely lucid sense in a backward, upside-down way that will rejuvenate you sexually, spiritually, and emotionally. Here's another approach to understanding the point I'm trying to make: The epic drama you're about to begin may yield no apparent lesson and provide no practical guidance -- unless you empty your mind and give up hope for extracting specific lessons and guidance -- in which case you will be flooded with wise insights.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

What tricks have you employed to outwit your fears in the past? Remember them. Review them. Next, think about the people who have inspired you to be more courageous than you imagined were capable of. If you take these two actions, you will prepare yourself well for the week ahead. I'm not saying that the things you're scared of will be any bigger or badder than usual. But I want you to know that you now have the potential to gain a robust new power over them.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You are currently getting more miles per gallon and more bang for the buck than you have in a long time. Your IQ is creeping higher. Your knack for scoring good parking places is at a peak. I'll even go so far as to say that it's been quite a while since you've been teased by such thoroughly useful temptations. And get this, Sagittarius: I suspect that you have an enhanced instinct for taking smart risks. The only downside of all this good news is that you may not know your own strength. That means you should test it fast; find out more about its potential. Otherwise, you might break someone's heart by accident, or prematurely shatter the illusions of a person who's not yet ready to stop living in fantasyland.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

I wouldn't be surprised if your whole life passed instantly before your eyes one day soon. Not because you'll come close to literal physical death or anything dangerous at all, but rather because you will have a brush with a magic power that could be yours in the future -- a magic power that will be possible for you to fully own only if you cut the umbilicus that links you to a dying source. Wow. Did I really say that in a fun little astrology column? And are you really prepared to change your life because of something you read in a fun little astrology column? I hope so. In the coming weeks, it'll be the fun little things that have the greatest potential to align you more closely with your soul's code.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In the days ahead, you may not realize what you're looking for until you find it. I advise you, therefore, to put into action the following five-point plan. 1) Suppress any know-it-all tendencies you might have. 2) Revive your childhood talent for being voraciously curious about everything. 3) Ask more questions than you've ever asked before. 4) Figure out how to be receptive without being passive, and how you can be humble without muffling your self-confidence. 5) Consider the possibility that you have a lot to learn about what's best for you.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I've borrowed a fable from the ancient Greek writer Aesop to create a parable you can use in the coming weeks. Once upon a time there was a very thirsty crow. Rain hadn't fallen in a long time, and the creek from which she'd always drunk had dried up. Searching and searching for a bit of moisture, the crow finally happened upon a tree under which sat a ceramic pitcher with some water in it. But the pitcher's neck was narrow, and the crow couldn't fit her beak past it to reach the water. Inspired by desperation, the crow at last got an idea. Why not drop small rocks into the pitcher, making the water's level rise? And that's exactly what she did. How sweet it was when at last she quenched her thirst.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I expect that you will soon stumble upon a key secret to your next masterpiece. And I'll be surprised if you don't discover a healing agent that will be effective in correcting an old mistake. In fact, Aries, I prophesy that in the coming week, you will have a sense that you're doing the smart thing at least 90 percent of the time. Sorry: I'm afraid to say that I have no sad, bad, or mad news to deliver. If you're the type of person who thrives on cynicism, your immediate future may be pretty boring. If you're on the fence about whether life is a gorgeous feast or a chaotic mess, your ability to deal with outbreaks of goodness will be supremely tested.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In Salman Rushdie's story "The Prophet's Hair," a greedy man intentionally cripples his four sons when they're young, hoping to turn them into beggars who elicit profound sympathy and large cash donations. The plan is successful. His sons earn him a good income. Later, however, he comes into possession of a potent talisman -- a strand of hair from the prophet Mohammed -- and it magically heals the sons' ailments. They're no longer able to pull in big bucks, and grief descends upon the family. I bring this to your attention, Taurus, because I think there's a variation on these themes at work in your own life. A "magic charm" is available that could reverse or at least neutralize an old handicap. Do you have the pluck to surrender the questionable rewards that your impairment has brought you?

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

It should be an excellent week for potato chip breakfasts, rapid mood shifts, and short-duration flirtations. The abundance of superficial exchanges that will be available to you could actually add up into something resembling meaningful breakthroughs. You will have the chance to explore the art of the five-minute epic conversation, as well as the science of giving a single look that speaks a million words. You cannot possibly plumb the bottomless depths of casual, frivolous, lightweight diversions, but you should try anyway.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

On the one hand, you may find yourself unable to flow as freely as you'd like to in the coming week. I foresee the possibility that your streaming currents will get dammed up in places, or else shunted into narrow conduits that constrict your natural surge. On the other hand, this could compel you to make more practical use of your emotional assets. The applicable metaphor is the harnessing of a turbulent river to produce massive amounts of hydroelectric power.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

If you really knew how much you were loved, you would never cry again. A sublime relaxation would flood your nervous system, freeing you to see the beautiful secrets that your chronic fear has hidden from you. If you knew how much the world longs for your genius to bloom in its full glory, the peace that filled you would ensure you could not fail. You'd face every trial with eager equanimity. You would always know exactly what to do because your intuition would tell you in a myriad of subtle ways. And get this: A glimpse of this glory will soon be available to you.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

First of all, my friend, you don't need any second-hand anything, let alone second-hand love. Second of all, dearest, you are hereby ordered not to hang around any third-rate situations where you feel like a fifth wheel. You understand? Thirdly, wonderful one, keep in mind that any eight ball you may fantasize that you're behind is just a figment of your own delusions. Fourthly, lover, I assure you that your sixth sense can now lead you -- if you cleanse it of its excess superstition -- to a place that is, if you have a good imagination, a suburb of the seventh heaven.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I got an interesting spam today. A company that said it was very proud of its high-quality work offered to sell me phony credentials that are impossible to distinguish from the real thing. What caught my attention the most were the degrees from Harvard and Stanford. I wouldn't mind having one of those up on my wall. But in the end, I decided that instead of paying the company $230 for one of its excellent fakes, I'd simply make one myself. And instead of creating a degree from Harvard, I would have it be from a place where I actually have matriculated, namely the Raving Maniac Academy of Crazy Wisdom, which is the unruly school where I often find myself during my lucid dreams. I bring this up, Libra, because it would be an excellent time for you to make yourself a fancy fake diploma from whatever your equivalent is to my academy -- you know, the source that has been providing you with so much great teaching, even though it's not an official institution of higher education.

A Slovenian adventurer named Martin Strel swam the length of the Amazon River in Brazil. It took him over nine weeks to travel more than 3,000 miles. Previously he had breast-stroked his way down the entire Yangtze River in China, a distance of almost 2,500 miles. He scoffed at the idea of conquering the River Nile in Egypt, however. "It's long, but not challenging enough," he said. "It is just a small creek." That's the spirit I hope you will summon in yourself during the coming weeks, Scorpio: a determination to take on only the most invigorating tests that require heroic levels of resourcefulness. Skip the lesser trials.

Ideally, you wouldn't even be reading this. You'd be white-water rafting along the Franklin River in Tasmania, or riding on "the train at the end of the world" in Tierra del Fuego, or observing Golden Bamboo lemurs in the rainforest of southeastern Madagascar. Ideally, Sagittarius, you'd be far away from any newspaper that carries my column. You'd be taking a vacation from the Internet and unable to access my horoscopes there. In fact, you'd be out of touch with all media, period. But since you are reading this, you must not be doing the ideal thing. So please do the next best thing: Flee as far as possible from your usual haunts, your habitual influences, and your customary comforts.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Make sure that no one except you will be able to tear asunder what you join together in the coming days. Tie knots that will never slip. Build bridges that can't be burned. Send emails that cement new alliances and plug yourself into networks that are crackling with high-energy connections. Stock up on nails, safety pins, staples, tape, and glue. Be sticky, Capricorn! Just one caution: Do not marry your fortunes to anyone unless they're willing to be your devoted, synergistic warrior as much as you are their devoted, synergistic warrior.

Don't whine and complain just because your guardian angel seems to be driving hard bargains lately. You're actually on better speaking terms now than you've been in some time. Before the sweeter talk can begin, though, the two of you still have to work out kinks left over from previous miscommunications. Besides, there's a method in your guardian angel's madness, a reason why she or he is driving hard bargains: She or he is testing you to see if you're willing and able to stretch your imagination to accommodate the rowdier blessings you'll soon be tempted with.

Underdogs are on an upsurge. Topdogs are on a downswing. The rebels have God on their side. The masters merely have money and propaganda. It'll be an excellent week to launch strikes, boycotts, and protests. It'll be prime time to say no to smiling manipulators. The best efforts, whether coming from you or the people you want to be close to, will always have at least a tinge of cheekiness. So now that you've read my spiel, please answer me this: Are you going to sit there passively and grin as some feel-good tyrant tries to break off a chunk of your soul and hurl it into oblivion?

Are you a gelatinous pool of longing yet? Are you a perfumed garden of madly blooming purple explosions? Are you throbbing and gooey and half-nauseous with that delicious sickness some people called love? If not, I don't know what to tell you. By all astrological reckoning your gut should be swarming with drunk butterflies and the clouds should be taking on the shapes of mating horses. If you're not half-drowning in these symptoms, I implore you to find a way to pry open the floodgates.

You're primed to cancel a jinx in the coming days, Taurus. You could help someone (maybe even yourself) escape a bewitchment, and you might be able to soothe a wound that has been festering for a long time. In fact, I'm playing with the fantasy that you are now the living embodiment of a lucky charm. At no other time in recent memory have you had so much power to reverse the effects of perverse karma, bad habits, and just plain negative vibes. Your hands and eyes are charged with good medicine. Other parts of you are, too, which means sexual healing could be in the works. But as you embark on your mission to cure everyone you love, remember the first law of the soul doctor: "Physician, heal thyself."

The Norwegians used to have a concept called svoermere, which meant something sweetly futile or deliciously unprofitable. While I can see the appeal that your particular version of svoermere has had for you, Gemini, I think it's time to think about moving on. According to my reading of the omens, you have both a right and a duty to seek out more constructive pleasures that not only make you feel good but also serve your long-term goals.

It's Freedom from Want Week! For Cancerians only! During this uncanny grace period, you might actually feel perfectly contented. It's quite possible that you'll be free from the obsession to acquire more security, more love, more proof of your greatness, more chotchkes, more everything. You may even make the shocking discovery that you don't need nearly as much as you thought you did in order to be happy; that maybe you have a lot to learn about getting more out of what you already have.

Would you like to spend the next 30 years working your assets off to make your bosses rich? If not, I suggest you start formulating Plan B immediately. The astrological time is not exactly ripe to extricate yourself from the wicked game, but it's ripe to begin scheming and dreaming about how to extricate yourself. Here's a tip to get you in the mood. Assume that there's some validity in the meme that mythologist Joseph Campbell articulated: "Follow your bliss and the money will come." Then ask yourself, "Do I even know what my bliss is? Not my mild joy or diversionary fun but my unadulterated bliss?" Once you know that, you can follow it. And then, inevitably -- although it may take a while -- the money will follow.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

As the season of riddles and paradoxes kicks into high gear, I present you with a two-part quiz. Question 1: Since it has taken you your whole life to become the person you are today, is it reasonable to expect that you can transform yourself in a flash? Question 2: On the other hand, since you are more creative than you give yourself credit for, and are also in an astrological phase when your ability to change is greater than usual, is it reasonable to assume that you must remain utterly stuck in your old ways of doing things?

So much to say and do. So little time. Is it OK if I pepper you with pithy hints? It's the only way to fit everything in. Here goes. There's strength in numbers, Libra. So travel in packs. Round up support and whip up group fervor. Always say "we," not "I." Add at least one new friend and bolster at least one old friendship. Think before you act, but always act instead of watching from afar. Avoid doing stupid things in smart ways. To court good luck, do charity work. To ensure that extra favors will come your way later this year, do extra favors now.

The Biblical book of Isaiah prophesies a future time of undreamed-of harmony and cooperation. "The wolf will romp with the lamb," reads one translation. "Cow and bear will graze in the same pasture, their calves and cubs will grow up together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox." I have it on good astrological authority that you're now eligible for a mini-preview of this paradisiacal state. To receive your free introductory offer, you need only meet one condition. You must vow not to harm any living thing -- not even a cockroach. Not even the person you love best.

You Sagittarians are famous for filling your cups too full. Sometimes this is cute. Sometimes it's a problem for those who don't like Cabernet Sauvignon sloshed on their handwoven Persian rugs. This week, however, I predict there will be little or no hell to pay for overflowing. So go ahead and transcend your containers, you beautiful exaggerators. Feel free to express yourself like a fire hose. Now enjoy a few gems from your fellow Sagittarius, the extravagant poet and painter William Blake. 1. "The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom." 2. "Exuberance is beauty." 3. "The lust of the goat is the bounty of God." 4. "You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough."

Constant vigilance, my friend. That's what I advise. Be attentive to details you sometimes gloss over. Wake up a little earlier and prepare for each encounter with greater forethought. Stare a little harder into the hearts of all those whose hidden motivations might detour your destiny. Monitor all communications for hints that all is not as it seems. Most importantly, guard against the possibility that you may be overlooking a gift or blessing that's being offered to you in an indirect way.

"Keep exploring what it takes to be the opposite of who you are," suggests psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of the book Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention. This advice is one of his ideas about how to get into attunement with the Tao, also known as being in the zone or getting in the groove or being aligned with the great cosmic flow. How would you go about being the opposite of who you are, Aquarius? According to my reading of the omens, that will be an excellent question for you to muse about in the coming weeks. As you stretch yourself to embody the secret and previously unknown parts of you, I think you'll be pleased with how much more thoroughly that allows you to be in sync with the rhythms of life.

Internet addiction has risen to epidemic proportions in China. In early 2009, psychologists in Shandong province began offering an alleged cure that involved the use of electro-shock therapy. Parents of 3,000 young people paid Dr. Yang Yongxin and his team over $800 a month to hook their anesthetized teens up to machines that sent electricity through their brains to induce artificial seizures. After four months, the Chinese government intervened and halted the treatment, noting that there was no evidence it worked. This practice might sound comically barbaric to you, but I think it has a certain resemblance to the way you have been dealing with your own flaws and excesses: with inordinate force. In the coming weeks, I really think it's important not to punish yourself for any reason, Pisces, even if it's in a supposedly good cause. The lesson of the Chinese experiment is: not only is it overkill, it also doesn't even have the desired effect.

I fear you're on the verge of slipping into a state of mind that wants everything and is therefore in danger of getting nothing. I worry that you'll be lusting for such total control over so much wild sweetness that you won't actually formulate a foolproof plan to commune with even a pinch of that sweetness. Let's see if we can motivate you to overthrow this state of mind. Let's try to coax you into devising a precise strategy to assemble paradise piece by piece.

Cuckoo birds build no nests of their own. Instead, they rely on trickery to raise their young. The female cuckoo lays her eggs in the nest of a host whose eggs are similar in size and color. The host, often a sparrow, cares for the cuckoo's eggs as her own, and usually rears the hatchlings until they reach maturity. Does this behavior ring a bell? I suspect that something analogous is unfolding in your world. I'm alerting you to the situation so that you will be fully informed as you decide how to proceed. (P.S. I'm not saying this is a bad thing; just want you to acknowledge the truth.)

I hate to admit it, but love is not always enough to solve every problem. On some occasions you need love, clever insights, strategic maneuvers, and fierce determination. In my astrological opinion, this is one of those times. Take a moment right now to shush the grumbling dialogue you keep having with yourself about what's fair and what you deserve. Save all that mental energy for the work of fighting like hell for the fair share you deserve. Oh, and while you're fighting like hell, don't forget to be as strategic as Gandhi, as loving as Einstein, and as fiercely determined as Jack Black, Ben Stiller, and Sarah Silverman combined.

I invite you to write down brief descriptions of the five most pleasurable moments you've ever experienced in your life. Let your imagination dwell lovingly on these memories for, say, 20 minutes. And keep them close to the surface of your awareness in the week ahead. If you ever catch yourself slipping into a negative train of thought, interrupt it immediately and compel yourself to fantasize about those Big Five Ecstatic Moments. This exercise will be an excellent way to prime yourself for a New Age of Unhurried Bliss and Gentle Beauty, which I predict is just ahead for you. If you can keep the morose part of your mind quiet, there's a good chance you will stir up a new ecstatic experience that will belong near the top of your all-time list.

Welcome to your aromatherapy workshop, Leo. We'll be using imaginary scents because, frankly, sometimes fantasy yields better results than the real thing. (Especially for you right now; keep that in mind as you deal with other situations in your life.) For your first exercise, imagine the aromas of eucalyptus and vinegar. That'll clear your head of static, creating a nice big empty space for your fresh assignment to come pouring in from the future. Next, imagine the fragrance of hot buttered popcorn. It will make you more receptive to the outside help that has been trying and trying and trying to attract your attention. Have you ever taken a new computer out of the box? Remember that smell? Simulate it now. In your subconscious mind, it will awaken the expectation that the next chapter of your life story is about to begin.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

O ye of little faith: Do ye not understand that the events of mid-July through mid-August of 2009 are but the fruition of seeds ye planted in September, October, and November of last year? Do not thank or blame the gods, but only thyself, for the destiny that is upon ye. Now please prepare to assume thy new goodies and perks, O favored one, as well as thy new temptations and headaches, with full knowledge that ye are receiving the exact rewards and responsibilities ye earned many months ago.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Sometimes this job of mine grinds me down with a heavy sense of responsibility. Am I doing the right thing by divulging so many cosmic secrets? Do people use my advice in good ways? This week I'm especially tormented. Would it be ethical of me to reveal that you could dig a hot tip out of a wastebasket, or that you could prosper because of someone else's foolishness? Or how about if I disclosed that you've temporarily acquired a dicey edge over a competitor who's previously kicked your butt? And would it be mean of me to suggest that you shouldn't share a vast idea with a half-vast person? I guess I'll just have to trust that you'll show maximum integrity in using all of this inside dope.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

There goes your exaggerated respect for warped chunks of complications. Here comes an opportunity to make a break for bubbly freedom. To take advantage, Scorpio, you'll need to travel much lighter. So please peel off your armor. Wipe that forty-pound sneer of doubt off your face. Bury your broken-down theories by the side of the path, and donate all your unnecessary props to the birds and the bees. Strip down, in other words, to the bare minimum. Where you're going all you'll need are your good looks and a big fresh attitude.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Don't leave me hanging, Sagittarius. What happens next? How could you even imagine you've wrapped the whole thing up? According to my analysis, you've got at least one more riddle to solve, one more gift to negotiate, one more scar to wish upon. (Yes, that says "scar," not "star.") To stop pushing for more adventure at this pregnant moment would be a crime against nature and a whole chapter short of a bestseller. Get out there and bring this story home.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

It makes me famished just to think of you there stewing in your hunger. You almost remind me of a bear that's just awoken from hibernation or a political prisoner who's been on a hunger strike. And yet I know it's not a craving for food that you're suffering from. It's not even an impossible yearning for sex or fame or power or money, either. You're starving, you're ravenous, you're mad for something you don't have a name for -- something whose existence you don't fully understand and can't quite imagine. But I predict you'll uncover a fuller truth about this thing very soon, and then you'll be more than halfway toward gratifying your hunger.

If I were your daddy, I'd take you mountain-climbing or buy you a three-week intensive class in the foreign tongue of your choice. If I were your president, I'd give you a Purple Heart for your undercover heroism and make you ambassador to Italy. If I were your therapist, I'd send you on a pilgrimage to a sanctuary where everyone means exactly what they say. But I'm merely your five-minutes-a-week consultant, so all I can really do is say, "Escape the cramped quarters of your own mind. Slip away from the corners you've been backed into. Stop telling the convoluted stories you've concocted to rationalize why you should be afraid. Get out of the loop and escape into the big, fresh places that will rejuvenate your eyes and heart."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Long-standing myths are on the verge of mutating. Stories that have remained fixed for years are about to acquire unexpected wrinkles. The effects may be pretty spectacular. I suspect it'll be the equivalent of Sleeping Beauty waking up from her long sleep without the help of the prince's kiss, or like Little Red Riding Hood devouring the wolf instead of vice versa. There's something you can do, Pisces, to ensure that the new versions of the old tales are more empowering than the originals: For the foreseeable future, take on the demeanor and spirit of a noble warrior with high integrity and a fluid sense of humor.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Miracle of miracles: A pointless pain in the butt will soon stop bugging you. Meanwhile, an annoying itch in your heart is subsiding, and may even disappear. As a result of these happy developments, you will be able to concentrate on a much more interesting and provocative torment that has been waiting impatiently for your loving attention. Actually, it's an ancient torment dressed up in a new package. But as before, it's a torment you've never had the right name for. That's about to change, however. You're finally ready to find the right name for it, and when you do, you'll be halfway toward a permanent cure.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

When he was growing up, the father of basketball superstar Pat Riley forced him to play basketball with kids who were stronger and tougher than he was. He said it forged his son into a winner. I can see the principle at work, but it doesn't come naturally to me. In my efforts to provide you with the parenting you missed as a kid, I've always preferred a gentler, more nurturing approach. Nevertheless, the time has come to override my personal desires for the sake of your character-building needs. I recommend that you force yourself to play with grown-up kids who're stronger and tougher than you.

I wouldn't get too agitated about the supposed "writing on the wall" if I were you. The handwriting is not God's, for God's sake. It's not even that of a wise elder or young genius. So don't attribute too much authority to it, please. It's just the opinion of someone who doesn't know any more about the ultimate truth than you do. So I suggest you cover it up with black spray paint and then carefully inscribe your own version of the writing on the wall. Reality is especially malleable right now, so the most forcefully expressed prophecy will probably come true.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I believe that when you chatter carelessly about a big change that's in the works, you're in danger of draining it of some of its potency. So I don't want to trumpet or gossip about the gift that's on its way to you. I'll just mention that it's coming, and urge you to prepare a clean, well-lit place for it to land. Here's a hint: It could, among other things, help you convert one of your vulnerabilities into a strength or inspire you to start transforming an area of ignorance into a future source of brilliance.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

At the farmer's market, an escape artist performed in the middle of the street. As a crowd gawked, he had two big strong men tie him up tight in a straitjacket and 50 feet of chain. For the next 20 minutes he shimmied and contorted and bent over backwards. His face grew red and sweaty. There were no Houdini-like magic tricks. There were no puffs of smoke or magic boxes or mirrors or distracting assistants. He rarely spoke as the ordeal progressed, but in the end, after the last of the chains slipped off and he wrestled his way out of the straitjacket, he said simply, "Now I invite all of you to go home and use what I just did as a metaphor for your life." It was a supremely sexy performance, and I realized maybe it would help you with your current situation.

Your concentration for dicey assignments, like conquering fear and adversity, is sharp. And I bet you'll summon a lot of stamina and resourcefulness if you're pressed to solve a crucial riddle during a turning point in your own personal hero's journey. On the other hand, humdrum details have the potential to flummox you, especially if they involve tasks you're not even that interested in or committed to. The moral of the story: Banish absent-mindedness by keeping yourself focused on only the most riveting challenges.

The sky will not start falling. But something resembling heavenly tokens may cascade down with such frequency that you'll be wise to keep looking up a lot. You never know when another piece of the blessed puzzle will come raining down. And it would be a shame to suffer the embarrassment of having your favorable fortune knock you over. Who'd have ever guessed that a shower of good news would be such a tricky trial?

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Scorpio? Since we're midway through 2009, let's take an inventory. I hope that by now you have at least begun building the power spot or energy source that will serve as your foundation for the coming years. So much the better if it's more than halfway finished and will be ready for full use by the end of summer or early fall. Remember my promises: Life has been and will continue to be conspiring to get you settled in your ideal home base, supercharge your relationships with your closest allies, and connect you with the resources that will fuel your long-term quest.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In the Middle Ages, people became adults when they turned seven years old. These days, the threshold is much later. I'm happy about that. In my view, the longer you can hold on to your playful irreverence and innocent lust for life, the better. Still, there is value in taking on the kinds of responsibilities that help you express yourself with grace and power. So I don't mean to rush you, but it might be time to take a step towards being on the verge of tiptoeing to the brink of preparing to accept more adulthood into your heart. You could make the process less harrowing by hanging out with those rare wise guys and wise girrrls who've survived the transition to greater maturity and a higher degree of professionalism with their youthful flair more or less intact.

I don't care what you feel this week, as long as you don't feel nothing. Get inflamed with hunger or justice or sadness or beauty or love, but don't submit to apathy. Don't let yourself be shunted into numbness. You can't afford to be cut off from the source of your secret self, even if it means having to feel like hell for a while. And the odd thing is that if you're willing to go through hell, you won't have to go through hell. So to hell with your poker face and neutrality and dispassionate stance. Be a wild thing, not a mild thing.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)
The Iliad is an ancient Greek epic poem that describes events near the end of the Trojan War. Most modern critics regard it as a foundation stone of Western literature. In my opinion, though, it's mostly just a gruesome tale of macho haters who are inflamed with pride, treat women like property, and can't stop killing each other. I share the perspective of poet Diane di Prima, who once had a dream in which The Iliad was cast as gangsta rap. Now please adopt the style of our critique for use in your own life, Aquarius. What supposedly noble or important situation is actually pretty trivial or cliched? It's time for you to tell the truth about the hype.

"May you live in interesting times." That old toast is actually a droll curse meant to be heaped upon an enemy. "Interesting" implies rapid change, rampant uncertainty, and constant adjustment. What¬ís preferable is to live during a boring era when stability reigns. Or so the argument goes. But I reject that line of thought. I celebrate the fact that we're embroiled in interesting times. I proclaim our struggles to navigate the sharp turns and uphill climbs to be a jubilee of the first degree. What fantastic luck it is to be on the planet when everything mutates! May we be up to the task of bringing heaven down to earth. May we be worthy of the trust the universe is placing in us. Now get out there, Pisces, and enjoy the hell out of the epic and entertaining drama we're stewarding. This is your time to be a leader and a luminary.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Time to diversify your energy sources, Aries. It's as if you've grown too dependent on oil -- metaphorically speaking -- and have neglected to develop relationships with wind turbines, solar panels, natural gas, and other means of generating power. What if in the future -- metaphorically speaking -- oil becomes scarcer or wildly expensive? And what if, over the long haul, its byproducts degrade your environment? I suggest you start now to expand the variety of fuels you tap into. It's a perfect moment to adjust your plans for your long-term energy needs.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Your mirror may lie to you this week. A friend might neglect to share a crucial detail. Even pets and heroes and normally reliable suppliers might not be completely there for you. Fortunately, I expect that secondary sources will come through. Other people's mirrors may reveal a clue you haven't been able to find in your own. An acquaintance could step forward and do a convincing impersonation of a friend. And a previously overlooked or unknown connection might become your own personal wellspring. Moral of the story: If you're willing to be flexible and forswear all impulses to blame, you won't be deprived of what you need.

Having discovered I can read the minds of animals, I've started a new sideline as a ghostwriter. Here's an excerpt from an interview I did with Prestige, a potbellied pig born under the sign of Gemini. Brezsny: What do you like best about being a potbellied pig? Prestige: I'm greedy but cute. I get to eat like a pig, yet not be victimized by the negative judgments people usually project onto pigs. Brezsny: Is there anything you're worried about? Prestige: I need to make my caretaker understand that for the next few weeks we Geminis will need more than the usual amounts of food, love, presents, praise, attention, everything. Brezsny: Anything you'd like to say to my Gemini readers? Prestige: Don't let anybody make you feel guilty for wanting what you want.

The ancient Chinese sage Lao Tse said, "People of the highest caliber, upon hearing about Taoism, follow it and practice it immediately. People of average caliber, hearing about Taoism, reflect for a while and then experiment. People of the lowest caliber, hearing about Taoism, let out a big laugh." Now substitute the words "your splashy new ideas" for "Taoism" in Lao Tse's quote and you'll have your horoscope for this week, Cancerian. For added punch, remember what he said in another context: "No idea can be considered valuable until a thousand people have laughed at it."

Nietzsche's dictum might be useful for you to keep in mind right now, Leo: "If it doesn't kill you, it'll make you stronger." Since I'm very sure that the turbulent waters through which you're navigating will not kill you, I'm looking forward to all the ways this journey will upgrade your confidence and enhance your power. But there's more to be gained, beyond what Nietzsche formulated. It's also true that if it doesn't kill you (which it won't), it will make you wilder and kinder and smarter and more beautiful.

According to my projections, you will not, in the coming weeks, meet a dark, secretive stranger who'll play you like a violin. Nor will you be lured to the warehouse district after midnight to pick up the "missing stuff." And I highly doubt that you will be invited to join a cult that's conspiring to seize political power following the events of December 21, 2012. No, Virgo. Your fate is far more mundane than that. In fact, it's more likely that you will soon meet a bright, forthright stranger who will play you like an accordion. You will be drawn to a convenient location at midday to pick up the "missing stuff." And you will be invited to become part of a group that has the potential to play a significant role in your quest for meaning in the coming years.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

For years, I've remembered most of my dreams every night, so I'm good at spotting trends. And one of the themes that has arisen recently involves you Libras. Last week, I dreamed that three of my Libra friends were pole vaulting at the Olympics. Four nights ago, I dreamed that my two favorite Libran astrologers were rappelling up a skyscraper. Last night, I dreamed that four Libran celebrities -- Mahatma Gandhi, Gwen Stefani, Sacha Baron Cohen (a.k.a. Borat), and Kate Winslet -- climbed a gold ladder to a cafe on a cloud where they drank magic coffee that made wings sprout on their backs. So what's going on? Is my subconscious telling me that it's prime time for you to raise your expectations and upgrade your goals? Do my dreams mean you should rise above the conventional wisdom and rededicate yourself to your loftiest ambitions? What do you think?

Spiritual epiphany alert! Uncanny revelations imminent! Hope you don't mind being awoken in the middle of your regularly scheduled life by a special delivery from the Great Beyond. Yes, my cute little bundle of rumbling feelings and psychic sensitivities: It doesn't matter if you're a true believer or an unrepentant infidel -- you will soon be invited to have one of your logical certainties torn out by the roots and replaced with a throbbing vision of cosmic whoopee. Brace yourself for the most pungent fun you've had since your last mudwrestle with the angel.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

While appearing on the TV show "I'm a Celebrity . . . Get Me Out of Here," ex-pro basketball player John Salley gave some advice I'd like to pass along. "When you see crazy coming your way," he philosophized, "you should cross the street." I do think crazy will be headed in your direction sometime soon, Sagittarius, and the best response you can make is to avoid it altogether, preferably in a way that it doesn't notice you. That's right: Don't shout at crazy, don't bolt away ostentatiously, and certainly don't run up and give crazy a big hug. There are far better ways for you to gather in your fair share of intriguing mystery; I'd hate to see you get bogged down in a useless, inferior version of it.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Everyone wants an extra piece of you these days, and they don't necessarily care about how it will affect you. So beware of emotional manipulation, subliminal seduction, and the temptation to believe in impossible promises. To make matters more extreme, I suspect you may be secretly pleased that everyone wants an extra piece of you -- and might be tempted to conspire in your own dismantling. Let me propose a compromise. How about letting three trustworthy people -- no more -- take an extra piece of you? And be very certain that they have enough self-control to know when to stop taking.

You're almost never one brick short of a load. Know what I'm saying? Your elevator almost always goes all the way to the top floor. Rarely, if ever, do I have to warn you against playing with a deck of 51 cards. So I hope you don't be offended when I say that it's time to find that missing brick and service your elevator and buy a new deck. In other words, you're due for your 40,000 mile check-up.

magic  (ma' jik), n. 1. A mysterious event or process that seemingly refutes the known laws of science. 2. A willed transformation of one's own state of mind. 3.

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." (Arthur C. Clarke.) 7. A quality predominant in the lives of Pisceans during the period July 1 through July 20, 2009.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Reality TV personality Spencer Pratt used to be skeptical about the power of prayer. But his wife Heidi, herself a devout believer, urged him to keep his mind open. Then, as an experiment, Spencer asked God to help him and Heidi get a double date with teen pop star Miley Cyrus and her boyfriend, despite the fact that neither of them even knew Cyrus. Apparently God heard and responded, because not too long after that, the hoped-for double date did indeed come to pass. I'm telling you this, Aries, because I think you're entering a phase when you, like Pratt, will have extra luck in making idiosyncratic wishes come true. If I were you, though, I'd focus on more profound idiosyncratic wishes than the kind Pratt pined for.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Do you have a subconscious urge to escape the constraints of your customary behavior? Have you ever wished you could be someone else for a while? If so, this is your lucky week, Taurus. The cosmos is granting you a temporary exemption from acting and feeling like your same old self. From now until July 2, you have permission to walk like, talk like, think like, and even make love like a Pisces or Virgo or Gemini -- or any sign, for that matter, except Scorpio or Aquarius. You might enjoy checking out my horoscopes for the other signs, and following the advice that sounds most fun.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

It's Fete Your Feet Week, Gemini. Your soles definitely need more attention, pampering, and contact with nature. (So does your soul, and hopefully that will happen as you carry out the more literal assignment.) So abstain from wearing your shoes and socks at every opportunity. Get as much contact as possible between your naked feet and the naked earth. Even walking unshod on floors and pavements could prove helpful. Foot massages are advisable, as well as pedicures, henna tattoos, and foot baths. Try praying with your feet instead of your hands, and see if you can get someone to kiss and adore you down there.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"His heart was growing full of broken wings and artificial flowers," wrote poet Federico Garcia Lorca. "In his mouth, just one small word was left." There were times during the first half of June when I was tempted to borrow those words to describe you, Cancerian. Now, thankfully, you're moving into a much brighter phase. The buds that are about to bloom in your heart are very much alive, not artificial, and your wings, while not fully restored to strength, are healing. Meanwhile, your mouth is even now being replenished with a fresh supply of many vivid words.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

What scares you or perturbs you in the coming week could, by August, become what fuels you. What makes you feel unsettled and out of sorts could turn out to be good medicine. But of course you're under no obligation to submit yourself to this experimental sequence, Leo. The fact is, you could probably run away from the discomfort and get immediate relief. Unfortunately, taking that approach would deprive you of the benefits that will almost certainly come from enduring the discomfort for a while. My preference is that you be brave and far-seeing.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

There's a better than even chance that you're about to embark on a Summer of Love. To improve your odds even more, meditate on the following questions. 1. What qualities do you look for in a lover that you would benefit from developing more fully in yourself? 2. What do you think are your two biggest delusions about the way love works? 3. Is there anything you can do to make yourself more lovable? 4. Is there anything you can do to be more loving? 5. Are you willing to deal with the fact that any intimate relationship worth pursuing will inevitably evoke the most negative aspects of both partners -- and require both partners to heal their oldest wounds?

You are entering a phase when you'll have more power than usual to influence people. Your charisma will be waxing and the light in your eyes will be growing more intense, making it more likely that your point of view will be heard and appreciated. Your powers of persuasion will be increasing, as well, and you'll have extra understanding about how to motivate people and get them to work together effectively. So let me ask you the most important question: What exactly do you want to accomplish with your enhanced clout?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Congratulations, Scorpio. You've reached the end of the Big Squeeze. You've served your time in the bottleneck. And so I invite you to relax your pinched expression, loosen up your puckered expectations, and let the Season of Experiments begin. According to my projections, you will soon be receiving a host of invitations to wander into the frontier with your raw sense of wonder turned up all the way. Please research each invitation thoroughly before choosing. When you've decided which adventures are most likely to enhance your understanding of the art of liberation, dive in.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

A guy I barely know critiqued me at a party recently. "You haven't suffered enough to feel intense passion," he said. "Your life has been too happy, too easy." I didn't want to get into a debate about whether my life has been too happy and easy, so in my reply I didn't mention my divorce or the time I was shot or the grueling poverty I endured for 18 years. "So you're saying," I told him, "that suffering is the only way you can acquire passion? I don't agree. Have you ever raised a child? Have you ever been in love with someone who incited you to make radical changes in your life? Have you ever worked on a creation for many years and then submitted it to be judged by thousands of people? I have." I'm letting you know about this, Sagittarius, because I predict you'll soon be offered an experience like those I named -- adventures that have the potential to build intense passion without requiring you to suffer.

"The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows," said journalist Sydney J. Harris. That would be an excellent motto for you to live by in the coming weeks, Capricorn. Whether or not you're enrolled in school, you're in a phase when your capacity for attracting learning experiences is at a peak. To take maximum advantage of the cosmic tendencies, all you have to do is cultivate a hungry curiosity for fresh teachings and life lessons -- especially those that shift you away from gazing at your own reflection and toward peering out at the mysteries of the world.

Here's a preview of the accomplishments I expect you to complete in the next four weeks. Number of karmic debts paid off and canceled: 1. Number of bad habits replaced with good habits: 2. Number of holes blasted in your theory about why you can't do more of what you love to do: 300. Number of "necessities" lost that turn out not to be necessities: 1. Number of psychic wounds successfully medicated: 1. Number of confusing messes that evolve into interesting opportunities: 2. Number of romantic obstructions eliminated: 1 and a half.

A delicious forbidden fruit will be more available than usual in the coming weeks. You can choose to ignore it, of course. You can pretend it's not even there and instead concentrate on the less forbidden fruits that are tasty enough. Or, on the other hand, you can sidle up closer to the forbidden fruit and engage in some discreet explorations, testing subtly to see whether it's any healthier for your sanity than it used to be. I'm not sure what the best decision is, Pisces, but I do suggest this: Don't just rip off all your defenses, forget all your commitments, and start heedlessly taking big bites out of the forbidden fruit.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Are you secretly afraid of feeling secure? Do you equate stability with being bored and lazy? Do you suspect that your restless pioneer spirit makes you unfit for the slow, meticulous work of building sturdy foundations? If so, there's hope for you to change -- especially if you make a big effort in the coming weeks. The moment is ripe for you to learn more about the arts of energizing comfort and stimulating calm and exciting peace. To jumpstart the process, go get a massage. As you're being stroked by nurturing hands, brainstorm about the additions and adjustments you'd like to make in your five-year master plan.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Your education is about to take a curious and interesting turn. During the coming weeks, I expect that you'll upgrade your street smarts and explore a whole new meaning for the term "hands-on experience." You'll find out about an area of ignorance that was so deep and dark you didn't even know about it, and you'll take aggressive steps to get it the teaching it needs. Congratulations in advance for being brave enough to open your mind so wide, Taurus. I'm glad you'll be hunting for a fresh set of questions.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

The books of psychologist Carl Jung provide crucial insights into the nature of the unconscious mind. To the degree that I have any skill in deciphering the part of human intelligence that works in mysterious, secretive ways, I owe a great debt to him. I want to tell you an anecdote about him that may be useful. Once, as an adult, Jung took a break from work to go strolling on a beach. While meandering, he was overcome with a spontaneous impulse to build things as he did when he was a kid. He gathered some stones and sticks and used them to construct a miniature scene, including a church. As he finished, he was visited by a flood of novel intuitions about his life. He concluded that his childlike play had called forth these revelations from his unconscious mind. I suggest you try a similar tack, Gemini: To access important information that your deep mind has been sequestering, go play a while.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

We ask that you not divulge the climax of the epic story to anyone -- at least until you've let it sink in for a while and felt all the reverberations it has unleashed. After that, you'll be wise to speak about it only with skilled listeners and empathetic allies who can help you harvest the meaning of all the clues that were packed inside your adventures. One further counsel: Before you reach the absolute, final denouement of the drama, there may be a tricky turn that looks a lot like the ending.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

You have cosmic permission (even encouragement) to live on the edge for the next 28 days as long as you follow these guidelines: 1. Don't live on the edge to impress anyone; do it because you love it, or else don't do it. 2. Don't complain and worry about it. Enjoy it completely. 3. Don't expect anyone else to join you on the edge. If they choose to do so with enthusiasm, fine. But don't manipulate them. 4. Don't imitate the way other people live on the edge. Establish your own unique style. 5. Don't live on the edge for more than 28 days. Much longer than that and you'll start sabotaging the benefits.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In 1968, psychedelic rock band Iron Butterfly released its landmark 17-minute song, "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida." Cable TV network VH1 later named it as the 24th greatest hard rock tune in history. There are different stories about the origins of the title, but all agree on one point: It was originally "In the Garden of Eden." It became "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" through some fluke, probably caused by the lead singer getting intoxicated and garbling the words as he performed it in the recording studio. This would be an excellent week for you to induce and capitalize on creative mistakes like that, Virgo. I hope you do, because it'll help you get into the right frame of mind to stir up a mix of excellence and improvisation everywhere you go -- and that formula practically guarantees success.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Do you apologize to chairs when you bump into them? Often end up being the only one at a party who'll talk to the most boring person? Ever find yourself starting your sentences with "I hope I'm not bothering you but I was wondering if you would mind if I . . . "? If so, this is a good time to make a shift. That's why I suggest you add some bite to your demeanor. Do what feels interesting at least as often as what's polite. Look for what advances the plot as much as what fosters harmony. The point is not to go overboard, of course. You don't want to fling insults or arouse friction. Add fire to your presentation, but don't start conflagrations.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Evaluating Adam Lambert after one of his exotic, virtuoso performances back in April, American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi praised him as being "confusing, shocking, sleazy, and superb." That's a standard you could soon achieve in your own sphere, Scorpio. But do you want to? You'll have to care less about maintaining your dignity than usual, and be especially forthright in expressing yourself. Let me leave no doubt about what I'm saying: To be as superb as you potentially can be, you'll have to be at least a little confusing and shocking and maybe even sleazy.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Metaphorically speaking, Sagittarius, you have unearthed or are about to unearth a rare fossil. I think it's a pretty sensational discovery. It's a missing link that could help you make sense out of episodes in your past that have always mystified or frustrated you. I urge you to learn all you can about this fossil. Follow every lead it points to. And ask your intuition to run wild and free as it dreams up possible interpretations to its multiple meanings.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Maybe it's time you did something in return for all the free advice I give you. From a karmic perspective it might not be healthy for you to continue to take, take, take while never giving back. So this week, for a change, how about if you compose an oracle for me? Or send me a nice present -- nothing big or expensive, just a thoughtful token. JUST KIDDING! The truth is, I don't care if you ever express your appreciation. You give me a momentous gift simply by caring enough to read my words. Being able to speak with you so intimately has made me a better and smarter person. Now I suggest you do what I just did: Acknowledge how much the receivers of your gifts do for you.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"I guess I just prefer to see the dark side of things," says actress and comedian Janeane Garofalo. "The glass is always half empty. And cracked. And I just cut my lip on it. And chipped a tooth." As witty as that thought may be, I don't recommend you make it your approach in the coming days. My analysis of the omens suggests that reality will be especially malleable. Even more than usual, it will tend to take the shape of your expectations. So please, Aquarius, try hard to see the lovely, graceful, unbroken glass as half-full of a delicious, healthy drink.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I feel an expansive, permissive mood coming on -- in the cosmos, that is, not me. To be honest, I'm in a more conservative mood than the cosmos. But the planetary powers-that-be have decided to float you poetic licenses, blank checks, special dispensations, and wild cards. I just hope this free stuff won't make you forget about the finely-crafted containers and boundaries you've been working on lately. Maybe I'd feel better if you promised me to keep on doing the careful, conscientious things that seem to have earned you all the good fortune that's on its way.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

So you're trying to tell me that the way out is the way in. Is that right? And that the "wrong" answer just might be the right answer? And that success, if it makes an appearance, will most likely happen by accident? I don't know, Aries. It's tricky to get away with this upside-down approach to life unless you have a lot of discipline and yet also don't take yourself too seriously. You've got to be both rigorous and flexible -- a stickler for detail and a master of improvisation. I do suspect you're up for the challenge, but what do you think?



How much do you want to know about your destiny? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your intriguing fate, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.


Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In an interview, musician Attiss Ngoval told the San Francisco Chronicle that he'd want the superpower of X-ray vision "IF and ONLY IF I could use it to see people naked under their clothes. I don't want it if all I see is skeletons." That's a good standard for you to keep in mind during the coming weeks, Taurus. I definitely think you'll have an ability to see deeper into the multi-layer levels of reality than you've had in quite some time. But your challenge will be to employ that gift to explore sights that are really interesting and useful to you, not just everything and anything that's usually hidden.



Want more help in exploring the Great Mystery that is your life? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE.


Gemini (May 21-June 20)

My astrological charts suggest that your immediate future is wide open -- so much so that it's difficult to predict which scenarios are more likely than all the others. This might mean that your free will is especially free right now. But in the interest of giving you something specific to grab on to, I'll name a few of the myriad possible scenarios. 1) A self-styled anarchist scholar, heir to the fortune of a famed Japanese anime artist, will invite you to a sushi feast at a speakeasy club called "Planet Mars" to discuss the Theory of Everything. 2) A clownish saint with a tattoo of a cobra swallowing the Earth will get you high by sniffing the pimple medication Clearasil, and then tell you a secret about who you were in one of your past lives. 3) A familiar stranger will hand you a Cracker Jack toy and whisper, "Are we never going to see each other again? Or will we get married tomorrow?"



Do you have enough info about yourself for now, or are you curious for more? If you'd like to go further, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead. 


Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In honor of the karmic clean-up phase of your astrological cycle, I invite you to do the following exercise: Imagine a pit in the middle of a desert that holds everything you've ever used up, spoiled, and outgrown. Your old furniture is here, along with stuff like once-favorite clothes, CDs, and empty boxes of your favorite cereal. But this garbage dump also contains subtler trash, like photos that capture cherished dreams you gave up on, mementoes from failed relationships, and symbols of defunct beliefs and self-images you used to cling to. Everything that is dead to you is gathered here. Got that vision in your mind's eye? Now picture yourself dousing the big heap of stuff with gasoline and setting it on fire. Watch it burn.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

This would be a good time to activate your sleeping potentials by chanting positive declarations about your relationship to what you need. Instead of typical New Age affirmations, however, I think you'll benefit from something edgier and more poetic. That's why I'm offering you the statements below. They were originally written by Andrea Carlisle for use by spiders. Say the following several times a day: "I am now receiving many fine fat flies in my web. My web is strong and masterful. My web is irresistible to all the attractive creatures I like to nibble on. I am amazingly clever and extremely popular. Even now, hundreds of juicy tidbits are headed towards my web."

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

A talent scout who has the power to change your course is drawing closer and closer. Find out why, and capitalize on it. Meanwhile, a chameleon who has always had your number just lost it. Find out the details, and take advantage. If that's not enough to keep you busy, I'll clue you in to the fact that a cool fool only recently realized you have something that he or she wants. Find out who and what, and exploit the possibilities. (P.S.: I should also mention that there's a wild thing out there who would love to lick your hand. Find out why, etc.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"The formula 'two and two make five' is not without its attractions," said Dostoevsky. I believe you'll benefit from embracing that perspective in the coming week, Libra. Transcending logic will be your specialty, especially if you do so with a spiritual gleam in your eye. Being a little crooked could awaken sleeping wisdom within you, as well as boost your life force and enhance your physical attractiveness. So please follow any hunches you have that inspire you to stop making so much sense. Explore the pleasures of using imaginative flair in your search for the truth.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

A lesbian reader who calls herself "Speedy Slow-Hand" wrote to me asking for advice. She explained that she keeps getting obsessed with the half-feral amazons whom her intense Scorpio self lusts after, and this causes her to miss making contact with the warm, nurturing women her softer side craves. Is it better to have someone to run the race with, she asked, or someone to massage her feet after the race? Whether or not you yourself are in the hunt for love, Scorpio, I think her testimony is an apt metaphor for your current dilemma. Should you go with the choice that makes your spirit burn with pungent excitement, or should you opt for what feeds your soul with rich relaxation? I would like to suggest that there's at least a 30 percent possibility you could have both.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Of the 190 short films the Three Stooges made for Columbia Pictures, only five actually had pie fights. However, those classic scenes sum up all there is to know about the mythic meaning of pie fights, as well as the needs they address and the techniques involved. I urge you to study up on the Stooges' teachings concerning these matters -- and put them to immediate use. Nothing could be more effective in dealing with stalled negotiations, convoluted mind games, superficial exchanges, excessive gravity, and bureaucratic slowdowns than a righteous pie fight. You can find a Youtube clip of a Three Stooges pie fight here.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Some people use sly intelligence rather than mindless rage to escape limitations that have outlived their usefulness. Do you know any? If so, soak up their influence. You could use some inspiration and counsel as you make your own break for freedom. The best way to ensure that your liberation will be permanent, not just a temporary reprieve, is to go about it with humor and subtlety and humility.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.


Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Writing in Earthwatch magazine, Anne Marcotty Morris rhapsodized about her trek into Brazil's rain forest. The jungle is a fecund place, she said: "Several barbed seeds that had attached themselves to me on our walk into the forest had sprouted by the time we walked out." These fast-growing seeds happen to be an apt metaphor for the state of your psyche, Aquarius. You're a hotbed of lush fertility. Given that fact, I advise you to be very discriminating about which influences you give your attention to. Whether they're good or bad, empowering or corrosive, they will grow fast.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

There has rarely been a better time than now to blend your fresh sparkly innocence and your deep ancient wisdom. The childlike aspects of your intelligence are especially available, and so are the visionary elements. Furthermore, the two have a great potential to complement and enhance each other. You might be amazed at how dramatically you could transform long-standing problems by invoking this dynamic tandem of energies.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm betting that in a couple of months the fates will give you license to play with boisterous gambles and exhilarating risks. But at this particular moment I recommend that you confine yourself to tame gambles and sensible risks. I realize that may be a bit deflating to your rambunctious all-or-nothing spirit, but I think it'll pay off in the long run. From what I can tell, this is an excellent time to lay the groundwork for the bigger fun ahead.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The oracle you're now reading normally has a retail value of $49.95. But because of your ongoing efforts to defeat your defeatist tendencies, and because of your dogged attempts to sabotage your sabotage mechanisms, and because of your heroic stabs at defending yourself against your defense mechanisms, you have earned the right to receive this advice absolutely gratis! To generate even more free stuff in the coming week, Taurus, all you have to do is learn how to turn around so fast that you can catch a glimpse of the back of your own head, and how to pat yourself on the back with both hands while kicking your own butt.

Seventeen-year-old Jay Greenberg is a music prodigy who has written numerous sonatas and symphonies. His first CD, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and Julliard String Quartet, came out in 2006. It's not exactly a struggle for him to create his compositions. He often completes them in less than a day. "The music comes fully written," he says, "playing like an orchestra in my head." I believe you now have something in common with him, Gemini. According to my reading of the omens, there will soon be ripe visions of future accomplishments floating around in your imagination. You should write them down or describe them in detail to an ally or do whatever else it takes to launch the process of getting them born.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"You may want to smash a painful emotion to bits, but you can't blow it up with a nuclear bomb," wrote Tsoknyi Rinpoche in his book Fearless Simplicity. What makes the situation even more poignant is that the painful emotion may be based on a wrong interpretation of experience. It may also be caused by some faulty conditioning that got imprinted on your sensitive psyche when you were a toddler. Having said that, Cancerian, I'm pleased to inform you that you currently have the power to significantly dissipate the intensity of a certain painful emotion you thought you'd never shake. To initiate the process, invoke forgiveness in every way you can imagine -- toward those who hurt you, those who ignored you, those who misled you, and you yourself.

"I can't exactly walk on the water," says Russ Crim, "but it looks like I can because I know where the rocks are hiding just beneath the water." This would be a good trick for you to emulate during the coming weeks, Leo. By doing your homework and some advance scouting, you could put yourself in a position to accomplish a splashy bit of hocus-pocus that will ultimately be legendary. To help ensure that you don't generate a karmic backlash as you glorify your ego, I suggest you find a way to make your magic serve some worthy cause. For instance, maybe you could walk on water in order to raise money for charity.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

When I was 19 years old, a so-called psychic predicted I would die when I was 24. As much as I scoffed at his careless quackery, his words subliminally worried me for years. On the day I turned 25 I celebrated extra hard. Partly because of that experience, I've always tried to be impeccably conscientious about how I conduct myself as a fortune-teller. I've vowed never to manipulate you with melodramatic prophecies that could distort your free will. So it's with a cautious sense of responsibility that I offer the following augury: The weeks ahead could be one of the most illuminating and successful times of the last five years.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I suspect that this is a turning point in your relationship with your fantasies. It's not enough merely to keep musing about them with wistful longing. You can't afford to continue postponing their activation until some mythical future. If you want to keep them from receding into a hazy limbo, you will need to give at least one of them a big push toward becoming a more concrete part of your life. The universe will provide ample assistance if you do give that push.

Attention all aspiring lottery winners! If you will ever in your life win more than $10 in the lottery or similar game of chance, this would probably be the time. I'm not saying you definitely will. I'm simply suggesting that your odds are better than usual -- certainly better than the chances that you'll be invited by Brad Pitt to co-star with him in a feature film about alien pirates set in 22nd-century Madagascar. On the other hand, the possibility of a dumb-luck windfall is still rather remote compared to the likelihood of other kinds of financial progress. For instance, there's an excellent chance that you'll stimulate the flow of good fiscal karma if you spend quality time taking inventory of your approach to money and developing a long-term master plan to promote your prosperity.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Would you say you're closer to the "happy wanderer" model of Sagittarian, or the "eternal fugitive" type? Does your motive power usually come from the desire to head in the general direction of some attractive destination, or else to flee from every situation you're nervous about getting hemmed in by? Are you more inclined to shoot at multiple targets, hoping that one of them may turn out to be the correct one for you to aim at? Or do you prefer to identify the best target right from the start, and only then begin shooting? The coming weeks will be an excellent time to meditate on these core Sagittarian issues.

In astrology, the word "quincunx" refers to a relationship characterized by creative tension. Two planets that are in quincunx are like two people who have a certain odd affinity for each other but don't speak the same language. Imagine an Italian woman and an American man meeting at a party and experiencing an immediate chemistry, even though each can barely understand what the other is saying. I bring this up, Capricorn, because these days you're in a quincunx dynamic with pretty much the whole world. To keep frustration to a minimum and enhance the excitement quotient, you should try to crack some of the foreign codes you're surrounded by.

Philosopher Buckminster Fuller said that although we are all born geniuses, the process of living tends to de-genius us. That's the bad news. The good news is that 2009 is one of the best years ever for you to re-genius yourself, and the month of June is among the best times in 2009. So how should you go about the glorious task of tapping in to the totality of your original brilliance? Here's one tip. Do what Einstein said: "All I want to do is learn the way God thinks. All the rest is details."

Dear Rob: I've recently developed a propensity to talk to myself. This is pretty weird. All these years, I've barely uttered a few words to myself on special occasions. Now I'm having long, convoluted gab fests, as if the little voices in my head had busted out of their holding cells, run amuck, and decided to NEVER SHUT UP! Am I crazy? - Out Loud Pisces." Dear Out Loud: It's a good sign that you're getting all the murmuring background noise out in the open. Not just for you but for many Pisceans, thoughts and feelings that had been hidden or secret are becoming available to your conscious mind. Once you clear out the backlog, the really useful revelations will begin.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

While reading a crime report in the online version of Northern California's Arcata Eye newspaper, I came across this entry: "A dreadlocked man attacked a lamp post on the Plaza with his mighty fists, punching it while yelling and, in the memorable description of a witness, 'fighting amongst himself.'" I immediately thought of you, Aries. According to my analysis of the omens, you've been fighting amongst yourself with -- how shall I say this? -- crafty ferocity. I'd be ecstatic if I could convince you to call a truce, begin peace talks, and maybe even begin practicing some crafty tenderness toward yourself.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

When you Tauruses are at your best, you get into a groove but not into a rut -- humming along with creative efficiency, not just going through the motions or repeating the same old tired shticks. When you're at the top of your game, it's because you've surrounded yourself with stimuli that make you feel peaceful and comfortable. Other people may work well under pressure and accomplish most when they're driven by stress, but you usually need to be at ease in order to access your deep brilliance. From what I can tell, everything I just said is a description of what will be happening in the coming weeks.

Research shows that if a stranger gazes at you for at least 8.2 seconds, he or she is definitely interested in you. If, on the other hand, the look lasts 4.5 seconds or less, there's no attraction. I'm guessing that the percentage of long scrutinies you receive in the coming weeks will be higher than usual. Your raw charisma levels will be up, as will your ability to make strong first impressions. How do you plan to exploit the advantages this will give you, Gemini? According to my projections, it'll be a good time to meet some allies of the future.

One of the tastiest frogs in the world is at risk of dying out as a species. The "mountain chicken" frog, once a fixture on the chain of Caribbean islands known as Montserrat, has become endangered through loss of habitat, disease, and over-hunting by humans. In response to the crisis, conservationists have airlifted a number of survivors to new homes, attempting to save their kind from extinction. I think it's time for you to arrange a comparable intervention of your own, Cancerian. A sweet and delicious part of you or your world is not exactly thriving, and needs some strenuous help and care.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

A Florida woman, upset that her local McDonald's had run out of Chicken McNuggets, phoned the 911 emergency service line for help. In an unrelated incident, a Florida man took the same action when Burger King told him it had no lemonade to sell him. I recommend that you not indulge in similar overreactions in the coming week, Leo. The Drama Queen or Drama King archetype is threatening to possess you, and I suspect you'll have to act forcefully to keep it away. If you're successful, you'll be visited by a far more congenial archetype -- the Social Butterfly. And that would prove to be amusing and productive.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Most of you Virgos have built-in safeguards that ensure you won't abuse power. That's why I feel uninhibited about advising you to grab all the new authority and influence you can get in the next few weeks. It's one of those phases in your astrological cycle when you're more likely to be in line for promotions, new privileges, and increased clout. I hope you won't be shy. You may have to be uncharacteristically aggressive as you claim your rightful potency and rewards.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

In the coming days, the surprise and delight quotient will be way up. I bet you'll be more prone than usual to uttering exclamations.  There may also be a confounding "aha!" and a mind-wobbling "What the frack?!" mixed in there, although I think the emphasis will be on developments that educate and entertain you. Since you will probably be ushered in the direction of the frontier, I think you should find new ways to express your amazement. Instead of cliches like "Jesus H. Christ!" or "Holy crap!", why not try something fresh, like the following: "Great Odin's raven!" . . . "Radical lymphocytes!" . . . "Cackling whacks of jibber-jabber!" . . . "Frosty heat waves!" . . . "Panoramic serpentine." Any other ideas?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

As I was driving out in the country, I spied a curious statement written in large crooked letters on a homemade sign: "I have seen the truth and it doesn't make sense." I'm guessing you might feel that way yourself right now, Scorpio. You have summoned the courage to see the deeper reality beneath the official story, but that has made you more confused than you were when you only possessed a smattering of iffy facts. So you're smarter and better informed, but are nonetheless feeling less secure. My advice: Don't flee back into the fake comfort of comfy delusions. If you can maintain your poise in the face of the raging ambiguity, you will ultimately be rewarded with a big dose of cathartic clarity.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"Wisdom is knowing I am nothing," said Indian philosopher Nisargadatta Maharaj. "Love is knowing I am everything. And between the two my life moves." According to my calculations, Sagittarius, you'll be more on the "knowing you are everything" side of the polarity for the next few weeks. That's because a flood is imminent. I expect you'll be on the receiving end of a massive outreach from the universe -- an influx of invitations, inquiries, and offers to make connection. You should also be prepared for the dizzying pleasure that comes from seeing how profoundly interlinked and interdependent you are.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

This is my pledge to you, Capricorn: I promise to use all my otherworldly connections to get your karmic debt reduced in the next few weeks. In return, I ask that you make these pledges to me: You promise not to be a self-pitying martyr or a cranky beast of burden or a willing victim of rank manipulation. You agree not to just follow sloppy orders or passively capitulate as some bad guy with a nice smile tries to lower your standards. And finally, you swear to feed a really healthy desire that will ultimately help give your other desires more integrity and nobility.

"We all have a blind spot in love," says astrologer Jessica Shepherd at moonkissd.com. "Never simple to figure out and even harder to see head on, our blind spot is as unique and complexly layered as we are." But it's not a hopeless cause, I would add. In fact, you may ultimately be able to discern the contours of your special ignorance about romance; you may find a way to fix the unconscious glitch that has undermined your quest for meaningful intimacy. How should you proceed? Well, you will need skillful ingenuity, a willingness to gaze upon a flustering truth about yourself, and maybe a little miraculous grace. And now here's the very good news, Aquarius: It so happens that all these things are available to you right now.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

It's a ripe time to revise and rework your past, Pisces. I'll trust you to make the ultimate determination about how best to do that, but here are some possibilities. 1. Revisit a memory that has haunted you, and do a ritual that resolves it and brings you peace. 2. Return to the scene of an awkward anomaly that remains unsettled, and finally do a duty you neglected. 3. Make your way back to a dream you wandered away from prematurely, and either re-commit yourself to it, or put it to rest for good. 4. Dig up and contemplate a secret that has been festering, and come to a decision about what you can do to heal it.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The fleas infesting dogs' skin have greater leaping power than the fleas on cats. Why do you think that is, Aries? Maybe you should use your waxing brainpower to get to the bottom of this great mystery. Just kidding! While it is true that in the coming weeks you will have unusual skill in deciphering enigmas and clarifying ambiguities, I think you should direct that skill to really important matters that will improve your life for months to come -- not to trivial questions like fleas' jumping abilities.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Studies show that when most people take a shower, they lather the upper part of their bodies first and make their way down. I recommend that you take the opposite approach this week, Taurus. In fact, I think a similar strategy would be wise in just about everything you do. Start at the bottom and work your way up. Establish yourself at the ground level and then take care of the higher stuff. Pay respect to the roots and then tend to the branches.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

A couple I know planned to have their second baby delivered at home with a midwife's help. The father is a physician who assisted with childbirths during his residency, so he and his partner felt confident about conducting their rite of passage outside of the hospital. But once the mom's water broke and labor began, everything happened faster than expected. The dad gave the midwife an urgent phone call, but the kid was already crowning. "Don't cut the umbilical cord right away," the midwife advised. "It will minimize the shock of transition if the baby can get the hang of breathing while still being nurtured as she has for the last nine months." That's exactly what they did. And I hope you will do the metaphorical equivalent, Gemini. Keep getting fed the old way for a while as you learn how to be fed in the new way.

I swerve to avoid running over spiders that cross my path when I'm riding my bicycle. While at home, I prefer to shepherd flies out through an open door or window rather than swat them. I'm still not sufficiently enlightened that I've stopped trying to squash mosquitoes that dive-bomb me while I'm falling asleep, however. I'm working on it, but may need a few more years of meditation before I bring my reverence for all insect life up to the highest level. The way I see it, my fellow Cancerian, you'd benefit from working on a similar project in the coming weeks: improving your relationships with influences you don't have a natural affinity for.

"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world," wrote anthropologist Margaret Meade. "Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has." An excellent example of that occurred during America's Revolutionary War against England from 1775 to 1783. Of all the men in the 13 colonies who could have fought for freedom, only 16 percent did. I hope that gives you encouragement as you seek to fix a glitch in the status quo. You and your band of allies have more power than you know.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Up to one-tenth of the population is left-handed. Yet for centuries, even as late as the 1950s, there were social stigmas against left-handers -- similar in some ways to the perverse prejudice that has been directed toward homosexuals. So strong was the taboo that many parents tried to convert their naturally left-handed children into righties. Thankfully, this absurd form of repression is now defunct. (Five of the last seven American presidents have been left-handed.) But it's a good reminder that there are countless other ways in which our culture still attempts to coax us or force us into not being who we really are. But here's the good news: It's an excellent time for you Virgos to reject the pressure to be someone else and get back to where you once belonged. Reunite with the person you were destined to be!

The Tower of Terror is a thrill ride at Disney World. Riders are yanked up and down as they travel along a 199-foot pillar. A Florida woman named Denise Mooty believes this form of amusement is essential to her health. She says the extreme G-forces she's exposed to on the ride help dissipate the fibrous adhesions in her belly. I recommend a similar kind of therapy for you, Libra. Not to break up fibrous adhesions, since you probably don't have any, but rather to jostle your mental blocks, repetitive fantasies, and obsessive habits. They might just break into pieces and dissipate if you shake them in the right way.

It's your choice, Scorpio. You could be a creative dynamo who changes the course of local history -- or you could be a plain old boring sex maniac. What'll it be? We here at the Free Will Astrology Libido Management Center encourage you to at least partially sublimate your unruly mojo into beautiful works of art, innovative business solutions, and brilliant strokes of collaboration. You don't have to stop boinking altogether; just make it the second most important thing you rather than your raison d'etre.

The planets are conspiring to unleash energies that will touch you in ways you didn't realize you needed to be touched. Any minute now you may begin to feel a pleasurable burning sensation in your soft underbelly, or a prickly wake-up call in your willpower, or a ticklish electricity running through your funny bone. What does it all mean? Maybe nothing. Or maybe it means so much that you can't possibly analyze its meaning. What a valuable gift that would be! When is the last time you felt free of the need to have to understand everything?

A long-time Capricorn reader named Allison wrote me an apologetic email. She said that she has always loved my horoscopes, and still loves them, but for the foreseeable future she's got to stop reading them. "Please don't take it as an insult, because it's not," she wrote. "I just need to be less subject to outside influences for a while. Maybe that will help me get better at paying attention to my own intuition." I understood exactly what she means. According to my analysis, this is one time when you may have to shield yourself from the noise around you -- even the good and interesting noise -- in order to hear your own inner voice better.

Rolling Stone magazine has said that sixties folk singer Tom Rush (born February 8) was a major force in launching the era of the singer-songwriter. He's been lying low for a while, though. Recently he came out with his first new studio album in 35 years. I'm guessing that, like him, quite a lot of other Aquarians will also be climaxing new creations as 2009 unfolds -- perhaps even works that are long overdue or that have been extraordinarily slow in the making. And what happens in the next few weeks will be crucial in that process.

"All the problems we face in the United States today," said comedian and presidential candidate Pat Paulsen, "can be traced to an unenlightened immigration policy on the part of the American Indian." With that as your inspiration, Pisces, I urge you to take inventory of your own "immigration policy." It's an excellent time to do so, astrologically speaking. Here are some questions to guide you. What influences do you allow to pour into your sphere? Are they beneficial for your long-term mental health? What people do you invite to share your resources? Do they bring out the best in you? Do you have smart boundaries that keep out the bad stuff and welcome in the good?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Some people will never learn anything because they understand everything too soon," wrote Alexander Pope. Most of us have been guilty of that sin: jumping to conclusions so quickly that we don't bother to keep listening for the full revelation. My sense is that this behavior has become even more common in recent years because we're inundated by fragments of slapdash information mixed with blips of superficial analysis and echoed hearsay. But please avoid falling prey to the syndrome in the coming week, Aries. More than ever before, you need to gather raw data thoroughly, weigh the evidence with great deliberation, and come to careful understandings.

"The people of future generations will win many a liberty of which we do not yet even feel the want," said German philosopher Max Stirner. That bracing prediction has special meaning for you right now, Taurus. According to my astrological analysis, you are just becoming aware of freedoms that have not previously been on your radar screen. And as soon as you register the full impact of what they entail and how much fun they would be, you'll be wildly motivated to bring them into your life.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

I'm providing you with three metaphorical brainteasers. I hope they will help you work your chutzpah back into shape now that you're on the road to recovery. 1. Was your fright attack provoked by a venomous snake or by a garden hose that resembled a venomous snake? 2. After your pratfall, when you heard one hand clapping, did you regard it as an unforgivable insult or a humorous teaching? 3. When your healing crisis finally climaxed in a cure, was the catalyst a placebo or real medicine? Please answer these riddles even if you've already begun to feel fine again. It'll help ensure that the healing will last a long time.

The joke goes like this: "Why is a math book so sad? Because it has so many problems." But of course that's a distortion of the truth. In fact, the math book loves its problems. Its problems are its reason for being. Besides that, all of its problems are interesting challenges, not frustrating curses. Best of all, every problem has a definite answer, and all the answers are provided in the back of the book. Now here's the most excellent news of all, Cancerian: I think you'll be like a math book in the coming weeks.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"Dear Rob Brezsny: I really didn't like a recent horoscope you wrote for me. I'm a Leo, and although your oracle was sort of true, I didn't want it to be true, and furthermore I didn't want to lend my belief energy to help make it true. So I went hunting among the other signs, hoping to find a different horoscope that appealed more to the healthiest aspect of my fantasy life. I settled on the 'scope for Cancer, as it piqued my interest with just the right hopeful twist, and provided a highly motivating kick in the butt. Thanks! - Picky Choosy." Dear Picky Choosy: I approve of your efforts. These days I would love all of my Leo readers to be as imperious as you've been in gathering only the influences you want, and shedding the rest.

The scenario I'm about to describe is likely to happen only in your dreams or fantasies, not your actual waking life. But it will later have a correlation in your waking life, and perhaps will be instrumental in preparing you mentally and emotionally for the triumph you'll be able to accomplish in your waking life. So here it is, the mythic tale that I foresee unfolding in the subtle realms: A python will slither up and begin to coil around you. With an apparently irrational instinct that turns out to be quite smart, you will hiss loudly and then bite the snake, causing it to slip away and leave you alone.

According to my analysis of the omens, you would really benefit from a baptism right about now. Consider these questions as you design the ritual. Should you seek the help of a religious official, or do it yourself? Should the baptism be conducted in a Christian, pagan, Jewish, atheist, Buddhist, Hollywood, or free-form style? Is it enough just to sprinkle your head or should you go for full immersion? And if you choose the latter, will the dunking be more authentic if it's in a frigid river rather than a warm bath? These issues are for you to decide, not me. I insist only on this:  Let the holy water wash you free of guilt, remorse, and any habit of mind that tricks you into being mean or careless toward yourself.

After actor Woody Harrelson allegedly assaulted a paparazzo at New York's La Guardia Airport, he issued a press release claiming it was an honest mistake. He had just completed filming "Zombieland," a film in which his character had to relentlessly fight off zombies. It was understandable, he reasoned, that he mistook the pushy photographer for a zombie and naturally felt compelled to defend himself forcefully. As you shift back and forth between reality bubbles in the coming week, Scorpio, make sure you don't make a similar error. Keep clearly in mind that the laws of nature in one bubble may be quite different from the laws in the others.

I'm not necessarily saying you fell into a hole a while back, but if you did, the time is right to extricate yourself. Your strength is returning and help is in the neighborhood. Likewise, I'm not making an authoritative pronouncement that you did indeed cast a little curse on yourself during a careless moment. But if something like that did occur, you're entering an excellent phase to undo the mistake. You're awakening to how you went awry, and that's the first crucial step in correcting for the messy consequences.

"There are two things to aim at in life," wrote essayist Logan Pearsall Smith. "First to get what you want, and after that to enjoy it. Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second." You are currently in a position, however, to accomplish that magical second aim, Capricorn. More than ever before, you have the power to want what you actually have . . . to enjoy the fruits of your labors . . . to take your attention off the struggle so that you may fully love the experiences your struggle has earned you.

Scientists find previously unknown species of plants and animals all the time, usually consisting of tiny populations in remote locations. But the latest addition to the great catalog of life is a species whose members number in the millions and cover a huge swath of Ethiopia. It's a tree that botanists have never had a name for until now: Acacia fumosa. Unlike other acacias, it produces pink blooms in the dry season instead of yellow or pink flowers in the wet season. I predict that you will soon have a comparable experience, Aquarius: You'll "discover" and identify a unique wellspring that has been around forever but unknown to you. As you tap into its charms, I trust that you will make up for lost time.

In her column "Word Fugitives" in The Atlantic, Barbara Wallraff asked her readers to coin terms or phrases that would mean "the unfortunate telling of a story that one realizes too late is ill-suited to the occasion." The best ideas were "blabberghasted," "tale of whoa," and "put my faux paw in my mouth." I'll warn you to be wary of this behavior in the coming week, Pisces. You're likely to be unusually articulate, and your urge to express yourself may be extraordinarily pressing. That could make you susceptible to running your mouth. But as long as you monitor yourself for signs that you're about to go too far, I bet your fluency will serve you very well.

When they pray, Muslims face the Kaaba, a cube-shaped building in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Every mosque around the world typically has a niche that shows the precise direction of that holy place. Recently, however, worshipers have discovered that many of the older mosques in Mecca itself have niches that aren't pointing the right way. They're concerned that the prayers they've dispatched in the past weren't aimed correctly. Is it possible that there's a comparable scenario in your life, Aries? Might you be filled with righteous intentions, but not quite delivering them to the correct location? If so, this is an excellent time to make adjustments.

In recent decades, many British people with unfortunate surnames have changed them. There are now 40 percent fewer Shufflebottoms, while the numbers of Cockshotts and Smellies have also declined precipitously. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., the government has re-branded its notorious Global War on Terror, shifting to the more palatable "Overseas Contingency Operation." I hold these examples up for your inspiration, Taurus. It's a good time to alter any name or title you've outgrown, as well as any label that no longer fits or any category you'd like to leave behind.

I'm going to quote a few pieces of advice from a piece I found on the Internet, "15 Fun Things To Do During a Big, Important Test." I trust that this will stimulate your imagination in all the right ways as you get ready for your metaphorical version of a final exam. 1. Bring your own private cheerleaders in uniform. Have them cheer loudly whenever you answer a question. 2. Haul in a large, flamboyant idol. Set it next to you and pray to it often. 3. Bring a friend to give you a massage the entire time. Insist this person is needed because your thoughts flow properly only when your circulation is enhanced. 4. Every now and then, clap twice rapidly. if the teacher asks why, say, "The light bulb that goes on above my head when I get an idea is hooked up to a Clapper. DUH!"

Buster Posey is an up-and-coming baseball player for the San Francisco Giants. The poetic incongruity of his name is so apt a symbol for your imminent future, I'm making him your patron saint. According to my reading of the omens, you'll be called on to be like a "Buster" -- a macho, pushy, no-nonsense dude who gets things done -- but you will also find power in being as delicate and lovely and innocent as the small flower bouquet known as a posey. Sometimes it'll make sense to be one or the other. On other occasions, you'll benefit from being in both modes simultaneously.

"The Amazing Race" is a reality TV show in which two-member teams compete for money and prizes by doing odd feats in exotic locales. One especially stupid and awesome task they performed was carrying 50-pound wheels of cheese down a slippery hill in Switzerland. Everyone started out hauling the wheels on cumbersome wooden backpacks, but hardly anyone was able to make it to the bottom without falling, breaking the backpacks, and having to manually herd the runaway cheese the rest of the way. I foresee a similar fate for you, Leo. You'll be asked to do things that are both fun and frustrating, all in a cause that in the long run will be worthwhile.

One of the most successful managers in baseball history was Casey Stengel. His New York Yankee teams won the world championship seven times. Before the 1953 season, when the Yankees had already won four consecutive World Series, he made the observation that "If we're going to win the pennant, we've got to start thinking we're not as smart as we think we are." I hope some version of those words will come out of your mouth soon, Virgo. As savvy and crafty as you are, you'll have to become even more so in order to pull off the victory that's almost within your grasp.

This notice appeared on a bulletin board at a local nightclub that features hip hop DJs: "Missing: my great-grandmother's necklace, which dropped off my neck while I was krump dancing last Saturday. It might have happened when I was doing a head spin. The necklace has three strands of pearls and a pendant engraved with 'To Florence, 1927.' Contact Monique." I call this to your attention, Libra, because I think it's possible that you'll have an experience somewhat akin to Monique's. Playing exuberantly in a very modern style could result in you losing something from the old days. Unlike Monique, though, I bet your loss will be liberating.

BBC reported on the growing number of "spiritual tourists" who shop around in their search for inner peace. "We are entering a world," said one expert, "where people aren't interested in whether something is true or not, or whether they believe it or not, but whether it works." That would be a good prescription for you in the coming months, Scorpio. I recommend that you reject any idea or theory or practice unless it has the practical value of making you feel more at home in the world and more accepting of yourself.

I encourage you to attempt a difficult feat: For a few days, dissolve every burst of anger that rises up in you. Squash it. Wrestle it into submission. Attack it with love bombs. If you can eradicate the fury at its source, never even letting it ripen, that would be best. But the most important thing is to use all your ingenuity to keep your hostility, irritation, and snark from reaching the surface and spilling out. And why should you try this seemingly impossible experiment? Because according to my analysis of the omens, it would bring unexpected improvements in your physical and mental health.

Or the British artist who has completed over 5,000 paintings even though no gallery has ever shown his work? There is something about you that resembles those persistently frustrated people -- or at least has resembled them up until now. Soon, I predict, the dogged efforts you've made will finally pay off in at least a modest success, and perhaps even more if you'll make an effort to free your mind of its backlog of sad images.

Some people say they have rehearsed extensively by smooching the backs of their own hands or rubbing their lips up against posters of celebrities. Whether you've tried these techniques or have developed other strategies, Aquarius, I advise you to bone up on your skills. Not this week, but soon, you will be entering a prime romantic phase of your astrological cycle -- a time when you will have the potential to accomplish wonders and marvels with your mouth.

How do you deal with those three periods every year when Mercury is retrograde, as it is between May 7 and 30? I'd like you to consider the meditations of artist and activist Gabrielle Senza: "I think of Mercury retrograde as a big obnoxious Rottweiler on a chain that bares its teeth, lunging and barking as I walk by. I can choose to experience it in one of three ways: 1) as a frightening moment that catches me off guard; 2) as a humorous interlude that allows me to make fun of what I'm afraid of because I know it can't hurt me; 3) as an opportunity to change my route, usually leading to some wonderful surprise that rewards my instinct to willingly depart from my plans and projections."

"It is the greatest of all mistakes to do nothing because you can only do a little," said the writer Sydney Smith. While this is always good advice, it's especially apt for you right now. You're in a phase when giant leaps of faith are irrelevant, and fast, massive accomplishments are impossible. This is the season of incremental progress; a time when painstaking attention to detail is your best strategy. Inch by inch, Aries. Hour by hour.

If all goes well, they will bloom within two weeks, and, thanks to the marvels of communications technology, we earthlings will soon thereafter view one of the most iconic photographs ever seen. Paragon hopes the inspiring image of yellow blossoms on the lunar landscape will incite a new wave of space exploration. Take your cue from this vignette, Taurus. Come up with a riveting new personal symbol: some photo or image or object that thrills your imagination and inspires you to outdo all your previous efforts in pursuit of an ambitious future goal.

"A Pain in the Ash: Volcano Irritates Alaskans." That was the headline of a news story about how the people of Anchorage, Alaska are dealing with the erratic behavior of nearby Mount Redoubt. As of this writing, the volcano hasn't exploded yet, but it keeps hinting that it might. Meanwhile, it regularly burps clouds of ash that float around and wreak a lot of inconvenience. "I would like it to have a big boom and get it over with," said one native. In accordance with your astrological omens, Gemini, let's use this situation as a metaphor for your life. The fact is, there's no sense in getting irritated or impatient with the primal force in your vicinity. Doing so would be a waste of your precious emotional energy. Besides, cultivating calm equanimity is the best way to acquire the grace you'll need to respond appropriately when the primal force does go boom.

If His Holiness the Dalai Lama (like you, born under the sign of the Crab) had a Twitter account, I bet that this week he'd tweet something like this: "Nothing's permanent and we should never be attached to anything, but wow! -- the goodness rising up now may send ripples through eternity!" What he'd mean is that while reality is always in continual flux, and it's wise not to cling obsessively to either its pleasures or sadnesses, the powerfully healing mojo that's moving through Cancerians' lives these days could have long-term positive consequences.

America's Republican Party has lost a lot of style points lately. Its national committee chairman Michael Steele even went so far as to say, "We need to uptick our image with everyone, including one-armed midgets." Your reputation isn't anywhere near as in need of rehabilitation, Leo -- in part because you don't make references about one-armed midgets -- but it could still use some work. Fortunately, the coming weeks will be an excellent time, astrologically speaking, for you to not only tidy up your stature, but also to actually enhance your respectability and increase your influence. Take advantage!

The coming weeks would be an excellent time to devote extra care and attention to your home-away-from-home -- you know, the place that's second-best at making you feel like you truly belong here on this earth. Enhance the ambiance in this alternate power spot, Virgo. Add beauty to the decor. Let the people who hang out there know how much they mean to you. And if you don't yet have such a sanctuary, then I suggest you hunt one down. You need to experience more of the pleasurable stimulation that comes from going back and forth between two different comfort zones.

You may not literally have X-ray vision right now, but you certainly have a metaphorical version of it. With a little concentration, I bet you could peer beneath the surface of anything you want to. My analysis of the omens suggests that you have the power to see hidden agendas, invisible frameworks, and maneuverings that are unfolding behind the scenes. Please keep in mind that not all of the secret stuff is corrupt or insidious. Some of it is quite beautiful, even elevating. Don't push your enhanced perceptiveness to search exclusively for the worst in human nature.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

According to the legends of the Scottish Highlanders, this is the anniversary of the fallen angels' expulsion from paradise. That's why, they said, it was so crucial for humans to be well-behaved at this time. To blindly indulge in sin and error would set up a resonance with the malevolent exiles, making oneself vulnerable to being preyed on by them. While you and I can chuckle at this quaint superstition, it does have a grain or truth for you to meditate on. At this juncture in your yearly cycle, you tend to be more receptive to bad influences than usual. That's why you should do everything you can imagine to attract good influences and cultivate experiences that give you the feeling that this world is a paradise.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

An Arizona woman was jogging in the woods when a fox ran out of nowhere, leaped up, and clamped down on her arm with its teeth. Unable to pry it loose, the woman ran back to her car, which was a mile away, with the fox hanging on. She drove herself to the hospital, where doctors removed the creature and treated her successfully. I imagine that right about now you might feel a bit like she did, Sagittarius: bustling along energetically, in a state of alert, as some nagging vexation clings to you parasitically. Now here's the good news: I predict that you will get rid of the pest, and will ever thereafter enjoy an enhanced confidence in your ability to function well under pressure.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Since it's the Capricornian season of romance, I thought I'd give you some tips on how to thrive in the mysterious, paradoxical, crazy-making game of love. 1. Love shouldn't be a lottery, so don't gamble on unlikely odds. 2. Love shouldn't be a power struggle, so try to purge any unconscious yearnings you might have to control people you care for. 3. Love can't be a self-sustaining perpetual motion machine, so I hope you work on it at least as hard as you do at your job. 4. Love isn't an endless vacation in the promised land, but neither is it a wrestling match with a three-legged pit bull from hell, so don't you dare indulge in all-or-nothing fantasies.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

The kitchen table will be a power spot for you in the coming weeks. Your own table will be a supreme vortex for visionary brainstorming, but even those in other households could be epicenters for brilliant planning, crucial shifts in attitude, and increased solidarity among allies. To encourage eruptions of creative behavior, make sure the tables are nice and clean. Try to have good food and drink on hand. I also suggest you keep at least one notebook and pen lying around.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In April I was grateful whenever you obeyed all the signs, stuck to the beaten paths, worked a little harder than usual, and averted your eyes from the places where "interesting" bursts of chaos were unfolding. In May I'd appreciate it if you did pretty much the opposite: Question authority rigorously, wander off into less-traveled regions, play harder than usual, and tune in to commotions that could be productive learning experiences. In the past month, Pisces, I was hopeful that you'd pay your debts to society before society's collection agency started making harassing calls. In the coming month, I invite you to ask everyone to do you extra favors.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Astrology and Tarot cards are my favorite divinatory tools, but I also get a lot of use out of magnetic poetry kits. These are boxes full of evocative words and symbols in the form of refrigerator magnets. Sometimes after analyzing your astrological omens, I'll close my eyes, beam a question out into the ethers, and pluck a few magnets at random from one of my poetry kits. I just did that for you. "What are the keys to unlocking the enormous reserves of energy that are potentially available for Aries folks right now?" I asked. Here's the message that came: "swooping orgasms & laughing tears." (Or it could also be arranged this way: "laughing orgasms & swooping tears.")

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

One of the casualties of the recession has been grooming and primping. Many people are devoting less time and money to maintaining their appearance at peak levels. Make-up sales are down, and I've definitely been seeing more unkempt -- or should I say raw and unadorned? -- people lately. If you've been considering the possibility of cutting back on your own preening, Aries, now would be a good time to experiment. Why? For one thing, your natural attractiveness is especially strong these days. For another, you're entering a phase when you'll need people's approval less than usual. There's also the fact that anything you do to simplify your life will be a tonic for your mental health.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your role model for the coming week is George Garratt, a British guy who legally changed his name to Captain Fantastic Faster Than Superman Spiderman Batman Wolverine Hulk And The Flash Combined. Like him, I hope you will be extravagant as you re-imagine your self-image . . . and be playful as you take serious actions that permanently change things . . . and mess with the status quo in experimental ways that aren't dangerous but make you feel ecstatic to be alive.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

There's plain old everyday lightning, which travels about five miles, and then there are superbolts -- strokes of lightning that are a hundred times stronger than a normal flash and that can travel over 100 miles. In the coming weeks, Aries, your power levels could be more like these superbolts than your usual output. I suggest you take advantage. Just assume that you'll be able to shed more light and attract more attention than usual.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Don't you think it's time you toned down your manic aspirations? Aren't you curious about the sweet, sensitive success that could be yours if only you got really calm and peaceful? Wouldn't it be interesting to explore the more manageable opportunities that might become available by accepting your limitations with humble equanimity? APRIL FOOL! Don't you dare do any of those things, Aries. Your spiritual duty for the foreseeable future is to be a brave initiator of ingenious experiments . . . a high-powered self-starter who competes primarily with yourself . . . a pioneering warrior who's in quest of transcendent exploits that make it unnecessary to go to war.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The 1906 earthquake that hit San Francisco also demolished downtown Santa Rosa, about 50 miles to the north. During the rebuilding process, Frank Doyle, a local businessman who referred to himself as a "champion of the future," pushed a radical agenda. "When we construct our new downtown thoroughfare," he said, "let's make it wider than it has been in the past. That way it will accommodate the promising technological innovation called the automobile." Draw inspiration from Doyle's prescience, Aries. As you regenerate and rejuvenate your world, do the equivalent of creating wider roads. Be a champion of the future.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras is known as "the father of numbers." He taught that mathematics provides the ultimate truth about reality. His otherwise productive career went through a rough patch when one of his students found that the square root of two is an "irrational" number that can't be expressed as a simple fraction. "Impossible!" said Pythagoras. His system was built on the axiom that there are no such numbers. Yet he couldn't refute the student's proof. By some accounts, Pythagoras had the student drowned for his impunity. The brilliant theorist couldn't deal with the threat to his dogma. I bring this to your attention, Aries, because you have an opportunity to do what Pythagoras couldn't: accept the evidence that your beliefs about reality are limited, and incorporate the new data into a revised worldview.

"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste," said Rahm Emanuel, President Obama's chief of staff. "It's an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before." While your crisis is nowhere near as pressing as those faced by Obama's team, Aries, I recommend that you adopt a similar attitude in the coming days. Just assume that any breakdowns you experience will allow you to make breakthroughs that were previously impossible. Take advantage of a spiritual emergency to accomplish a spiritual emergence. As you deal with a scary trial, use it as an impetus to find a sacred trail.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Beware of people who act like polite jerks or tone-deaf music critics or emotionally numb lovers. While they may be able to teach you a lot about what you don't need, they're not worthy candidates for enduring relationships. Now let's turn our attention to the question of who exactly does belong on your future team. What encouraging voices should you draw into your inner sphere? What smart adventurers should be solicited as staunch allies? Which respectful helpers should be rewarded for the good influences they've had on you? It's an excellent time to make those determinations.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For a limited time only, you're in a position to consciously choose your next problems. This is a tremendous opportunity that I hope you won't allow to go to waste. By being proactive, you can ensure the arrival of fun and interesting dilemmas, thereby avoiding the frustrating and draining kind. In other words, Aries, if you go looking for provocative new challenges, the same old tired and trivial trouble won't come looking for you. I suggest you begin the quest as soon as possible.

I invite you to get all the mind-blowing sex you can this Valentine season, Aries. The entire cosmos will be on your side if you generate erotic wonders that rearrange your thought processes. For best results, cultivate the attitude described by the philosopher Voltaire in a letter to his partner Marie Louise Denis: "Sensual pleasure passes and vanishes, but the friendship between us, the mutual confidence, the delight of the heart, the enchantment of the soul, these things do not perish and can never be destroyed."

I was watching a martial arts competition on ESPN TV. It featured a fierce macho dance-off, in which rivals took turns brandishing their high-octane warrior choreography. At one point the announcer waxed poetic as the eventual winner pulled off a seemingly impossible move: "And that was a corkscrew illusion twist rodeo spin!" In the coming week, Aries, I urge you to do something like that yourself -- maybe even a few times. As you seek to take your game to a higher level, unveil your personal version of the corkscrew illusion twist rodeo spin.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Don't tell me you have nothing to be thankful for, Aries. Your parents could have named you "Hooligan" or "Lightsaber" or "Flu," and they didn't. There are no photos floating around the Internet that show you riding a pig in the nude. No one has ever broken up with you via text message. Now please keep going in the direction I've pointed you. Count your blessings up to at least 101. Create an ongoing list of all the things in your life that work pretty well and make you feel at home in the world. Why do this now? Because it's Massive Explosions of Gratitude Week for you -- a time when you can attract even more good fortune into your life by aggressively identifying the good fortune you already enjoy.

In The Devil's Dictionary, Ambrose Bierce defines history as follows: "an account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers, mostly knaves, and soldiers, mostly fools." Bear that in mind as you interpret what I mean by the following: You won't make history in the coming weeks. Instead, you will help generate an interesting and important story that will involve unfamous people who have little political power or military skill but have a great deal of potent grace and nuanced strength and soulful intelligence.

Please tell us what it is so we can face it and get on with life. - Semi-Elegant Bull in a China Shop." Dear Semi-Elegant: I'm not aware of having withheld a painful truth from you Tauruses. The only thing I can think of is that maybe I haven't been forceful or clear enough in saying the following: One of your primary tasks is to study hard and think deeply as you learn more about how to create peace and serenity in your life.

Kenneth Koch wrote the poem "The Boiling Water." Read this excerpt: "A serious moment for the water is when it boils / And though one usually regards it merely as a convenience / To have the boiling water available for bath or table / Occasionally there is someone around who understands / The importance of this moment for the water -- maybe a saint, / Maybe a poet, maybe a crazy man, or just someone temporarily disturbed / With his mind 'floating,' in a sense, away from his deepest / Personal concerns to more 'unreal' things." In the weeks ahead, Gemini, I encourage you to be one of those crazy floaters -- someone who tunes in to the serious moments that are normally outside your personal concerns. You need a strong dose of the hidden reality behind the obvious reality.

"When I grow up," writes Ramona McNabb, "I want to be a river." In the coming year, that would be a worthy aspiration for you as well, Cancerian. You'd generate a flood of benefits, some unexpected, by cultivating your ability to be perfectly yourself as you flow ever onward in rhythm with the sky and earth, unimpeded by the fluctuations of light and darkness, and in love with the ceaseless movement of your own strong currents.

For the citizens of Switzerland, it's immoral to absentmindedly pluck wildflowers out of the ground and throw them aside. That's because this enlightened country has a Bill of Rights for plants. The 22-page document, drawn up by a panel of theologians, philosophers, geneticists, and lawyers, strongly urges respect for the feelings and dignity of all vegetation. I wish you would think about including this mindset in your ethical code, Leo. It's high time for you to expand and refine your sense of right and wrong -- not just in relation to plants but to everyone and everything in the world.

"Many people feel guilty about things they shouldn't feel guilty about," wrote journalist Sydney J. Harris, "in order to shut out feelings of guilt about things they should feel guilty about." Your assignment is to figure out whether this description applies to you. If it does, be brave as you expose the truly guilt-worthy stuff you've repressed. Helpful cosmic energies will flow your way if you uncover what you need to atone for and then atone for it.

While working on his first draft of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson hung out at a tavern in Philadelphia and drank beer. While contemplating how best to motivate you Libras to seek more autonomy and self-determination, I was strolling along a California beach sipping a pi√±a colada and watching windsurfers. In the grand tradition of Jefferson and me, I hope you will put yourself in a relaxed and playful mood as you dream and scheme about all the things you could do to emancipate yourself in the coming months. For God's sake, don't make it a grave and ponderous meditation.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

If you use a cell phone, you have in your possession a metal called coltan, a component that's essential to the phone's function. Most of the world's coltan comes from the Congo, and is mined by Rwandans who survived their country's genocide in the 1990s. They often work for militias that sell coltan illegally to finance their military operations. It so happens that the land where this metal lies is also the home of the Mountain gorilla, an endangered species that is being decimated as the miners and militias kill them for food and savage their habitat. Keep this in mind the next time you call a friend. While you're at it, Scorpio, use Google and your imagination to meditate on the origins of all the important resources in your life. It's prime time to know more about their origins. You will benefit from getting familiar with the roots of whatever gives you power.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Ninety-seven percent of all youth play video games, dwarfing the number of kids who participate in activities like basketball, track, and javelin throwing. That's why I'm an advocate of making video games an Olympic sport. We should recognize where the real future of competitive sports lies. I mention this, Sagittarius, because it would be a good time for you to start upgrading your video game prowess in preparation for a possible berth in the 2012 or 2016 Olympics. In fact, the moment is right to plan on getting the training you'd need to become a master of any skills that may eventually win you rewards, even if they're not yet getting their rightful due from our culture.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Most art critics long regarded Gustav Klimt (1862-1918) as a second-tier modern painter, writes Don Thompson in his book The $12 Million Stuffed Shark. But that estimation got upgraded in 2006, when one of Klimt's paintings sold for $135 million. Art history was rewritten with a checkbook, says Thompson. According to my reading of the astrological omens, there's a possibility that your worth will also jump to a higher octave in 2009, Capricorn. But unlike Klimt, who didn't do anything new, you'll have to take action to earn your rise in status. How? Some suggestions: 1. Practice forgiveness with more intensity. 2. Be more tolerant of imperfection in yourself and others. 3.  Expand your capacity to give.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In the ancient Chinese book Poets' Jade Splinters, Lu Ji says: "Avoid the morning flower in full blossom and gather instead evening buds which are not yet open." He's telling his fellow poets not to rely on what has already ripened, but rather to concentrate on what's still in embryonic form. Lu Ji's colleague Song Zijing adds a complementary thought: "If you always use a compass to draw a circle and a ruler to draw a square, you will always remain a slave." Both Lu Ji's and Song Zijing's counsel will work very well for you in the coming year, Aquarius, even if you're not a poet.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Once every few years, a panel of Hindu and Buddhist judges in Nepal chooses a new "living goddess," a young girl who serves, until she reaches puberty, as an incarnation of the deity Taleju. One of the tests each candidate must pass in order to be eligible for the role is this: She must show no fear as she spends a night alone in a room filled with the bloody heads of ritually killed buffaloes and goats. I'd like you to consider the possibility of carrying out a more humane equivalent of that ceremony, Pisces. For one night, keep symbols of what you're afraid of in the place where you sleep. To do so would be an excellent way to earn the right to graduate to the next level of your spiritual evolution.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to some historians, Barack Obama won't be the first American president with African ancestry. As many as six previous presidents may have had black ancestors, with Warren Harding and Dwight Eisenhower being the most likely. None of the others claimed their heritage, however, choosing instead to pass as pure white. Obama is the first to acknowledge his bloodline. In the coming weeks, I see you as being in a position with certain metaphorical resemblances to Obama. You'll have the opportunity, though it may be a bit nerve-wracking, to thrive by celebrating a truth that no one before you has been brave enough to take advantage of.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

This week's advice comes to you entirely from the great jazz pianist and composer, Thelonious Monk. It all happens to be in perfect alignment with your astrological omens. 1. "Don't play everything or every time. Let some things go by. What you don't play can be more important than what you do play."  2. "A note can be as small as a pin or as big as the world; it depends on your imagination." 3. "Whatever you think can't be done, somebody will come along and do it." 4. "A genius is the one most like himself."

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

It's a favorable time for you to phase out at least 60 percent of your stale old fears. The cosmos is poised to assist you in this noble cause if you'll exert even a modicum of effort. What's that you say? You're afraid you can't live authentically without a hefty amount of anxieties? You secretly believe that you'd be bored if you didn't have your worries to entertain you? Well, here's an idea that might work: Simply replace your hackneyed, knee-jerk fears with a slew of silly and outlandish ones. They'll allow you to feel the friction you rely on to feel alive, but they won't bog you down with heavy stagnancy. For example, you could contract automatonophobia, the fear of ventriloquist's dummies, and apeirophobia, the fear of infinity. Other good choices might be kyphophobia, the fear of stooping, and lutraphobia, the fear of otters.

Maurice Krafft has made a career of filming places where hot lava is flowing. National Geographic describes him hiking across the crater floor of Ol Doinyo Lengai, an active volcano that's sacred to the Maasai people in Tanzania. The ground is not erupting in torrents of fire and burning liquid rock, but is constantly bubbling and exuding. Through long years of experience, Krafft knows exactly where to walk so that his shoes don't catch on fire. If you are going to attempt a metaphorically similar adventure in the coming weeks, Cancerian, make sure you've studied up on the ins and outs of the terrain. This is no time for guesswork or naive faith.

The world's record for most people running in a "Stiletto Sprint" is 265. That's how many put on three-inch high heels and competed in an 80-meter race in Australia last September. It's quite possible that your imminent future will have metaphorical resemblances to that event, Leo. If you want to strive for a certain goal, you may have to take on some limitation or handicap. My advice? Don't spend a minute resenting the imposed impediment. Just push ahead with cheerful equanimity and liberated pluck. You can win your equivalent of the Stiletto Sprint.

Mexican scientists have discovered a way to transform tequila into diamonds. Even the brands that sell for three dollars a bottle work fine as raw material. The catch is that the diamonds produced are too small to be used for jewelry. But they do have numerous practical uses: in surgical instruments, for example. You now have it in your power to preside over a comparable alchemical change, Libra. What could you do that would be like turning lead into gold or tequila into diamonds?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Beginning with Plato, a number of philosophers have proposed that humans suffer from a collective amnesia about where we come from and what we're doing here on planet Earth. Other thinkers of a more esoteric nature have suggested that our amnesia goes even further and is more personal, blocking us from remembering our previous incarnations. Then there are the modern psychologists who note that for most of us, the experiences we have before we learn to speak are virtually inaccessible to our memories. That's the bad news, Scorpio. The good news is that at least some of your amnesia will fade in the coming year, allowing you to glimpse and maybe even gaze steadily upon previously hidden panoramas. And it all starts soon.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

According to expert gerontologists, Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards (a Sagittarius) should have passed on to the next world a decade ago. The man has abused his body so thoroughly, his continued survival is a mystery. You're currently in an excellent position to achieve equally stupendous feats of persistence yourself, Sagittarius. More than ever before, you have a dogged capacity to keep pushing -- even in areas where you've been flighty or sketchy in the past. I'd say this is an excellent time to deepen your commitment to your dreams in very practical ways.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In one of his journal entries, Henry David Thoreau wrote about stumbling upon a single stalk of corn deep in the woods. It looked out of place there, so far from any cornfield, growing next to a pine tree. And yet it was doing just fine. How did its seed get there? By wind or animal? I suspect you will soon make a comparable discovery, Capricorn: a blaze of vitality that seems out of its element but is perfectly beautiful. Should you pluck it or engage with it or simply admire it? The freshest part of you knows the answer.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

This could be an epic year to be an Aquarius. I'm hoping you won't be satisfied with merely coasting along on the positive vibes that will be flowing in abundance. Rather than just enjoying your rising popularity, for instance, why not use your popularity to double your clout? And instead of simply increasing your productivity, why not supercharge your creativity at the same time? Finally, how about using your high levels of mental acuity to figure out ways to enhance your emotional intelligence? While this year will probably be pretty good no matter what, with some regular tweaks of your willpower you could make it amazingly great.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

If you're reading this horoscope, you're not a Cambodian orphan who grew up as a slave in a brothel or a Sudanese man kidnapped by a militia and forced to do heavy labor 18 hours a day or one of the 27 million other victims of human trafficking around the world. But you may be yoked and subjugated in a less literal way, perhaps to an addictive drug or an abusive relationship or a job that brings out the worst in you. The good news is that the coming months will be a favorable time for you to escape your bondage. Maybe it'll help you muster the strength you need, Pisces, if I inform you that your freedom won't be anywhere near as hard to achieve as that of the Pakistani boy tied to a carpet loom in a dark room or the Nigerian woman who's beaten daily as she toils in the sugar cane fields for no pay.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

During his time in the Senate, former U.S. presidential candidate John McCain has been a strong advocate for Native Americans. As chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, he sponsored or co-sponsored seven bills in support of Indian rights. And yet Native Americans voted overwhelmingly for McCain's opponent, Barack Obama, who has no such track record. When asked why, Native American author Sherman Alexie said that unlike most other groups, Indians don't vote merely for their own narrow self-interest, but rather for the benefit of all. They felt Obama would be the best president for America. That's the standard I urge you to use in the coming weeks, Aries. Stretch yourself as you work hard for the greater good, not just your own.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Hope "is not the conviction that something will turn out well," wrote Czech writer and politician Vaclav Havel, "but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out." That's the kind of hope I suggest you invoke during your current adventures, Taurus. Be hungrier for meaning than for any specific outcome. If you do that, ironically, the outcome is more likely to be one you feel pretty good about.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Describing my writing, one critic said that I was "like a mutant love-child of Anais Nin and Jack Kerouac." That also happens to be an apt description of the spirit you should bring to life in the coming weeks. So be like the memoirist Anais Nin: a collector of secrets, a connoisseur of intimacy, a fiercely sensitive alchemist who knows her own inner terrain better than anyone else knows their inner terrain. And also be like the novelist Jack Kerouac: a free-wheeling, fast-talking, wide-open traveler in quest of the spirit as it makes its wild plunge into matter.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In giving the Nobel Prize for literature to French writer Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl√©zio, the award committee praised him as an "explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization." I suggest you consider doing some of that kind of exploring yourself in 2009, Cancerian. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you will generate rich benefits for yourself by learning from people and influences that are beneath the notice of the mainstream, whether they're outside the box, off the grid, under the radar, or immune to the taint of the collective delusions.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"Obstacles are a natural part of life, just as boulders are a natural part of the course of a river," notes the ancient Chinese book the I Ching. "The river does not complain or get depressed because there are boulders in its path." I'd go so far to say -- this is not in the original text, but is my 21st-century addition -- that the river gets a sensual thrill as it glides its smooth current over the irregular shapes and hard skin of the rocks. It looks forward to the friction, exults in the intimate touch, loves the drama of the interaction. Sound like a pleasure you'd like to cultivate, Leo? It's an excellent time to try it.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Until last August, Nigerian religious leader Mohammadu Bello Abubakar had 86 wives. Then an Islamic council ordered him to divorce all but four of them. He was reluctant at first -- many of his 170 children were born of wives he'd have to separate from -- but since the alternative was punishment by death, he ultimately agreed. From the standpoint of your own evolution, Virgo, 2009 will be an excellent time to draw inspiration from Abubakar. I encourage you, in other words, to cull the excess and chaos from your love life. If you're single, narrow your focus down to a couple of fantasies rather than a wide variety. If you're in a committed relationship that's worth working on, swear off any possibility of cheating or escaping. In either case, perform an exorcism of all the ghosts that might threaten to distort your long-term romantic future.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"It takes a lot of time to be a genius," said author Gertrude Stein. "You have to sit around so much doing nothing, really doing nothing." I agree with her statement, which is why I have high hopes that you're going to tap into more of your dormant genius in the coming days. The cosmic rhythms are nudging you to enjoy a time of profound slack, and I think there's a good chance you'll agree to that.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

If you're an artist and you want to get steadily better at your craft, you need to continually refine your approach to telling the truth. The novelist Willa Cather said that. Now I'm here to invite you to adopt that strategy in 2009, whether you're an artist or simply a person who wants to live your life artfully. The coming months will be one of the best times ever for you to penetrate to the heart of the truths you aspire to live by and become highly skilled at expressing them in every little thing you do.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

When gasoline prices soared last year, a Christian group called Pray at the Pump organized vigils at gas stations, where they prayed for God's intervention. No one knows if their efforts were the cause, but the cost of gas did begin to plummet soon afterward. Inspired by their work, I have asked my team of non-denominational Prayer Warriors to gather in your behalf. Every evening for the next ten days, they will be calling on their connections with the Divine Wow to help you Sagittarians come up with smart and practical long-term plans for your financial well-being. On your end, you can supercharge their efforts by doing the appropriate research and meditation.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Please don't wear a t-shirt that says what I saw on the canary yellow t-shirt of the Japanese tourist at JFK airport: "Sorry, I'm a loser." I also beg you not to read Ethan Trex's book How to Seem Like a Better Person Without Actually Improving Yourself. It's very important, in my astrological opinion, that you not demean or underestimate yourself in the coming days. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that you have a sacred duty to exalt your beauty and exult in your talents. Now go read Walt Whitman's Song of Myself, and periodically murmur the first line all week long: "I celebrate myself, and sing myself."

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

While loitering on a sidewalk outside a nightclub in San Francisco on a September night back in 1994, I found the cover of a booklet lying in the gutter. Written by Marilena Silbey and Paul Ramana Das, it was called "How To Survive Passionate Intimacy with a Dreamy Partner While Making a Fortune on the Path to Enlightenment." Unfortunately, the rest of the text was missing. Over the years, I've tried to hunt down a copy of the whole thing, hungry for its wisdom, but have never had any success. I'm hoping that maybe you will consider writing your own version of the subject in the coming year, Aquarius. With the luck I expect you to have, you might actually be up to the task.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Now and then you may be able to whip up a wonderful breakthrough in the blink of an eye. But more often it's the case that beauty and truth and love and justice emerge in their full glory only over the course of a painstaking, step-by-step, trial-and-error process. "All that I made before the age of 65 is not worth counting," wrote renowned Japanese painter Hokusai. "At 73 I began to understand the true construction of animals, plants, trees, birds, fishes, and insects. At 90 I will enter into the secret of things. At 110 everything -- every dot, every dash -- will live." At this juncture in your personal evolution, Pisces, it's a perfect time to re-commit yourself to your life-long work.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's a great privilege to live in a free country. You're fortunate if you have the opportunity to pursue your dreams without having to ward off government interference or corporate brainwashing or religious fanaticism. But that's only partly useful if you have not yet won the most important struggle for liberation, which is the freedom from your own unconscious habits and conditioned responses. Becoming an independent agent who's not an unwitting slave to his or her past is one of the most heroic feats a human being can accomplish. And you, Aries, will have more mojo to do that in 2009 than you've had in a long time.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

American financier Jim Rogers evaluates life as many devout capitalists do: under what circumstances can he achieve the most wealth? That's why he relocated to Singapore. "If you were smart in 1807 you moved to London," he said two years ago, "if you were smart in 1907 you moved to New York City, and if you are smart in 2007 you move to Asia." With that as your spur, Taurus, I'd like you to identify the driving force of your life. The desire for more money? More power? Wisdom? Love? Status? None of the above? The next step is to meditate on the environment and the conditions that would be most conducive to you fulfilling your quest. In 2009, you'll have exceptional potential to create the ideal context for your success.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

When I was 19, I read Alan Watts' The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are. After that, I was sure there was nothing else I needed to know in order to live intelligently. It was, I thought, a compendium of the best insights worth knowing. My certainty eventually faded, thank Goddess. In its place came the understanding that life's mystery just keeps getting deeper and vaster as one grows older -- that it's idiotically arrogant to ever think you've got it all figured out. A healthier approach is to cultivate a capacity to be endlessly surprised. I hope you'll do that in 2009, Gemini. The flood of novel ideas and fresh perspectives surging your way will warrant it.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"Dear Rob: These last few months have been absurdly full of pluses and minuses, ups and downs, lefts and rights. There have been so many good things happening and yet so many obstacles, too. It often feels like we Crabs are being rewarded and punished at the same time. I'm wondering where it's all going and when it will end? A happy ending? A sad ending? No ending? Will zero ever equal one? - Agitatedly Neutral." Dear Agitated: You're at the climax of a long balancing process. I suggest you take this opportunity to tally up the valuable lessons you've learned in the relentless back-and-forth. Your graduation to a less ambiguous chapter of your life story will be more robust if you work hard to extract the meaning from experiences you've tended to see as random or confusing.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Here's an update on the world's tigers: Fewer than 5,000 are living in their natural habitats, while the U.S. alone has more than that number in zoos. Let's use that fact as a starting point for your meditations, Leo. How much of your animal essence is in captivity, and how much is running free? Is your inner lion able to wander at will through places where it feels at home, or is it trapped in a confined space it would never stay in if allowed to choose? Keep coming back to these questions during 2009. It will be an excellent time to spring the great cat in you from conditions that make it pace in neurotic circles.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In 2009, you'll receive a lot of help, some unexpected, whenever you phase out your trivial desires so that you can better pursue your truly important desires. The coming months will also be an excellent time to shed unrealistic fantasies so you can be freer to concentrate on the realistic kind. While these are not quite once-in-a lifetime opportunities, Virgo, they may be the once-in-a-decade variety. Why not draw up a plan for how you can take maximum advantage of the specific luck that will be flowing your way?

"God calls you to the place where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet," wrote Frederick Buechner. You're free to ignore that call, of course. You can pretend that you don't really know what brings you deep gladness, and you can act as if the world's deep hunger is of no concern to you. But if you hope to be proud of the life you have lived when, many years from now, you shed your mortal coil, I advise you to at least experiment with using Buechner's formula as a working hypothesis. The coming year will be en excellent time to do just that.

Studies suggest that the average person who reaches old age has been upset with some family member or another for a total of 30 years. Is that a standard you'd like to match, Scorpio? If not, you will have an excellent chance to reduce any inclination you might have to hold grudges in 2009. The coming months will bring you ripe opportunities to dissolve tensions between you and your kin. You will also be more skilled than usual at navigating your way with grace and diplomacy through complications involving the home and domestic issues.

"Dear Rob: I have followed my nose most of my life, weaving from pleasurable diversion to interesting crisis and back. I've honestly had a great time and wouldn't change a thing. But lately I've been getting strong hints from life that maybe the game is changing for me. More and more I'm feeling like the grasshopper in that old fable -- you know, with no resources stored up and winter coming on fast -- while all the steady, hard-working ants are sitting pretty. So here's my question: Do I really have to stop enjoying myself and get down to business, whatever that means? Are there any real jobs for grasshoppers? - Shaky Sagittarius." Dear Shaky: If there will ever in your life be a time when you could figure out how to be both a grasshopper and ant simultaneously, it will be in 2009.

The Swiss are building a 35-mile railroad tunnel through the Alps. It'll take another nine years to finish carving out the path through the mountain, and will ultimately require the removal of 24 million tons of rock.

I've got three quotes for you. I hope you'll write them out and keep them in a prominent place for the duration of 2009. They'll set the right tone for everything you do. The first is from psychologist Abraham Maslow: "A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself. What one can be, one must be." The second quote comes from choreographer Agnes DeMille: "Dance in the body you have." The third is from historian Gerald Sorin: "When Reb Zusye went to heaven, God didn't ask him why, in his life on earth, Zusye wasn't Moses, but why he wasn't even Zusye."

What would it take for you to collaborate with the forces of change? Not in a resigned, resentful way. Not with a sense of defeat, wishing things could stay the same forever. Rather, what would you have to do in order to feel eager about adjusting to the ongoing shifts? Is there any way you might even learn to experience exhilaration and gratitude in the face of the eternal flux? Your assignment in 2009, Pisces, is to become an expert surfer of the beautiful, playful, blessed waves.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Most people spend their entire lives immersed in three modes of awareness: waking, sleeping, and dreaming. But there are many other modes that have been explored down through the ages by the pioneers of consciousness. Some of them aren't very interesting to me -- like those sought out by people who use cocaine or methamphetamines, for instance -- while others are states I aspire to inhabit, like lucid dreaming, deep meditation, and a visceral perception of the fact that love is the fundamental law of the universe. I bring this line of thought to your attention, Aries, because I believe that in 2009 you will have excellent opportunities to open up your mind to levels of consciousness that are beyond the basic three. No drugs are necessary to take advantage -- only a driving curiosity to tune in to realities that are currently outside of your field of vision.



This week my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES offer you a teaser look at some of the major themes you will be working and playing with in 2009. Then, beginning December 30, I will devote three consecutive weeks of EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES to an in-depth discussion of your long-range outlook for the coming 12 months. Tune in!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What I foresee for you in 2009 is an upgrade in your approach to creating and maintaining your alliances. I envision you having dramatically enhanced intuition about how to connect with people in satisfying and interesting ways. I picture you being able to push beyond your habit-bound ways of conducting your relationships, ensuring that you'll be entertained and moved by them more than ever before. If I could give you a symbolic holiday gift to inspire you in this work, it might be a long, thick golden thread interwoven with a long, thick silver thread. Happy Holy Daze, Aries!

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's an ideal time for you to throw a party for all the people you've ever been and all the different selves who live within you now. Invite the teenager who once seethed with frustrated potential and the four-year-old who loved nothing more than to play. Include the hopeful complainer who stands in the shadows and dares you to ask for more, as well as the brave hero who comes out every now and then to attempt seemingly impossible feats of happiness. Don't forget any of the various personalities who have contributed to making you who you are. Celebrate your internal diversity. Marvel at how good you are at changing.

The European Union has had rules banning the sale of ugly carrots with knobby protrusions, cucumbers that are grossly curved, and equally unaesthetic specimens of 24 other fruits and vegetables. Recently that changed, however. The stiff standards were relaxed. "It makes no sense to throw perfectly good products away, just because they are the 'wrong' shape," said the EU's commissioner for agriculture. I suggest you make a metaphorically similar shift, Aries. It's time for you to expand your capacity to welcome some fine, useful things that happen to look a bit imperfect.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Have you ever arrived at a mountaintop on a clear day? Do you remember what you felt like? Can you re-imagine the sparkling purity of the air as it sweetened your lungs, the shimmering light that washed through you in lush waves, the exaltation of the sweeping vista as it lifted you to a deeper understanding of where your place is in this life? That's the kind of peak experience you need and deserve in the coming days, Aries. If you can't actually get to the top of a mountain, find the next best thing.



How much do you want to know about your destiny? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your intriguing fate, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Fifty-five percent of Americans not only believe in guardian angels, but testify that they have been actively aided by the intervention of those divine helpers. Commenting on the results, one religious expert said that "Americans live in an enchanted world." The 55 percent figure may rise even higher in the coming weeks. A majority of Aries all over the planet, regardless of their religious orientation, could have a mystical experience that will spook and delight them. If you're one of the chosen ones, don't get fixated on or distracted by the sheer amazement of the visitation. Make sure you're alert for its eminently practical guidance.

"You can't know fire unless you play with it," says Mark Finney, a math whiz who develops computer models for fighting forest fires. I offer that as a motto for you in the coming week, Aries. I'm not saying you should purposely ignite a conflagration for the sake of impulsive experimentation. I'm not saying you should kick smoldering embers around like soccer balls or light a cigarette while you're pumping gasoline or buy yourself a flame-thrower. What I am saying is that it will be in your interest to learn more about how to play safely with intriguing, useful fires. (Finney's quote comes from the July 2008 issue of National Geographic.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Uranus is on the opposite side of the sun from Saturn right now. To traditional astrologers, that's a stressful aspect. It bespeaks a titanic clash between the forces of progress and the inertia of the past. But there are mitigating factors. The expansive planet Jupiter is trine to Saturn and sextile to Uranus, suggesting that unexpected grace may provide beauty and healing during these strenuous moments of truth. I predict that's what will occur in your personal life, Aries. You're well-situated to navigate smartly through the brouhaha. For best results, respect the old ways, but not so much that it slows down your exuberant quest for the most interesting possible future.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What perplexing defeat was inflicted on you once upon a time -- a defeat that you still can't figure out how to rise above? What painful memory continues to lurk at the edges of your awareness, taunting you with its implication that you'll never be whole? This is the time and this is the place, Aries, to solve a riddle like that so that you can move on to the next chapter of your life. You will get unexpected help and inspiration if you make it your intention to heal what has been hard to heal. Halloween costume suggestion: a doctor or nurse wearing a sign that says, "Physician, heal thyself."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The government of my home country America spends an obscene fortune on its armed forces -- as much as do all the other nations of the world combined. In fact, we are by far the most weaponized empire in the history of the world. Our 761 military bases in over 100 countries dwarf the comparatively puny garrisons of the Roman and British empires at their peak, with 37 and 36 bases respectively. If our military costs were cut down to a more reasonable amount -- say the same as that of China (whose population is more than four times the size of ours) -- we'd have an annual trillion-dollar bonus to deal with the financial infection that erupted here and sent toxic ripples throughout the world. Maybe we'd even have enough left over to seed a national health care system.  Keeping that in mind as a metaphor, Aries, make this your hypothesis: By reducing the hostility, combativeness, and judgmental ire that you personally generate, you'll be far more likely to navigate your way toward prosperity.

"Sometimes the fastest way to get there/ is to go slow," sings Tina Dico in her song "Count to Ten." "Sometimes if you want to hold on/ you've got to let go." That's a ripe oracle for you to meditate on, Aries. As you explore the nuances of its meaning, you may discover secrets about how life is always working behind the scenes to balance things out. You might also see that going to any extreme will often attract the opposite extreme into your life; an excess of yang can lead to yin, and vice versa.

Writing in The New York Times, Paul Krugman waxed snide as he described the mindset of the U.S. Congress. It "has always had a soft spot for 'experts' who tell members what they want to hear," he wrote. It's very important, Aries, that in the coming week you avoid that kind of behavior. In fact, I recommend that you seek out people who have a track record for intelligent objectivity, and ask them to tell you what you might not want to hear. At the very least, solicit insights from thoughtful types who aren't inhibited about giving you their perspectives on what you're doing. It's Feedback Season.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In her book Courtney Love: The Queen of Noise, Melissa Rossi reports that in the mid-1990s "Courtney surrounded herself with a coterie of soothsayers, even approaching hipster stargazer Rob Brezsny, who declined to provide his astrological services." Rossi doesn't explain why I declined, but I'll tell you. Courtney wasn't interested in the kind of information I specialize in. She pressed me to tell her whether her romantic future should be with Trent or Billy, and I urged her to talk about the changes she could make in herself and her life to get clear about what she wanted. She implored me to predict her future, and I prodded her to formulate intelligent questions that would help her create a beautiful and interesting future for herself. I bring this up, Aries, because in the coming weeks I hope you will do what I suggested she try back then.

Every day for 44 years, the German writer Karl Wilhelm von Humboldt composed a poem for his wife, the lively and brilliant Karoline von Dachroden. In accordance with your astrological potentials, Aries, I will ask you to briefly imitate his prodigious outpouring of creative love. Every day for the next two weeks, please find it in your wild heart to make a sublime, or at least gorgeous, offering to someone or something you adore.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Believe it or not, whatever has been limiting your movement has also been expanding your capacities. It's true. The pinching sensation you've had to endure has been covertly generating psychic fuel that you will soon be able to access. Therefore, Aries, I say unto you: Praise your squelchers and constrictors! Be grateful for your stiflers and tweakers! They have primed you for the arrival of a luminous boon.

Some people would like the world better if it didn't have oddballs, freaks, black sheep, misfits, and crackpots. Personally, I'm very much in favor of these types, and celebrate the entertaining diversity they add to the world. I hope you share my attitude, Aries, because you're going to have to be in intimate relationship with your own inner weirdo in the coming week. If you're prejudiced against people who don't act normal, you'll have trouble dealing with the unusual urges and needs that will be welling up in you. But if you've developed an appreciation for anomalous behavior, you'll be able to love yourself just right.

"Like an ox-cart driver in monsoon season or the skipper of a grounded ship, one must sometimes go forward by going back," wrote novelist John Barth in The Friday Book. Consider using that approach, Aries. Retreat may be the strongest move you can make right now; surrender could turn out to be a masterstroke. But in order to get the most out of this strategy, you've got to keep your ego from injecting its agendas into situations. Don't act out of shame or pride; don't humble yourself excessively or be burning for revenge. Be objective, neutral, poised.

My Aries friend David's acupuncturist diagnosed his current condition as an "encroachment of phlegm in his triple heater." That's also an apt metaphorical description of what's going on in your psyche. Your internal engine -- the fire in your belly -- is a bit clogged by a sluggish stream of swampy, snotty feelings. I suggest you take action to purge this creeping effluvia. A good way to start would be to do what Gestalt dream workers do: Imagine that the effluvia can speak, and ask it to tell you what it wants.

Your next assignment is to inject more fun into your job -- or into anything that feels like work, for that matter. You've got a head start because lately you've been playing harder than usual. That should give you creative momentum as you reinvent your approach to activities that push you to your limits and test your resolve. For best results, be open to the possibility that you really don't have to keep being bored and cranky in places where you've assumed you will always be bored and cranky.

Golden Globe-winning actress Edith Evans had some advice for actors who were just coming into their full power: "Don¬ít indulge yourself by showing off; the moment that you begin to find that you can do something well, you must control it and do it more selectively." This recommendation would serve you well in the coming weeks, Aries, no matter what your work is. You have reached a higher level of self-expression; you have achieved a degree of mastery in a skill you've been struggling to learn. Now it's time to practice wielding your new command with enhanced discernment and discipline. (Evans' quote comes from John Gielgud's book An Actor and His Time.)

Do you get aroused from squeezing balloons until they explode? Do you quiver with delight as you watch popcorn pop? Have you ever been patient enough to stand in front of a ripe flower bud for hours to witness its slow explosion into full opening? If you answered yes to any of those questions, you're in for an orgasmically pleasing week, Aries. Lots of things are going to change into something else through the process of eruption or sprouting or bursting forth. I bet you'll dream of undersea volcanoes spurting.

Work can be hazardous for the actors who portray cartoon and fairy tale characters at Disney theme parks. The U.S. Health and Safety Administration reports that one-third of them have suffered on-the-job injuries. A prime cause of the mayhem: kids who kick and punch, sometimes out of misplaced exuberance and other times out of Lord-of-the-Flies-style malice. I wanted to preface my advice to you with that story, Aries. Your assignment this week is to summon the angelic 85 percent of your inner child to come out and play. As for the other 15 percent -- the part of your inner child that might be inclined to pummel Mickey Mouse or headbutt Cinderella: Keep that rascal under wraps.

Anna Renalda Hyatt, a reader from Colorado, bragged to me about her prowess. "My capacity for expressing love far surpasses that of anyone I have ever met," she wrote. "I am a Sublime Genius of Love, a Master of Unconditional Compassion, a Virtuoso of Deep Empathy." Your assignment in the coming days, Aries, is to compete with her: Unleash a perfect storm of ingenious passion that will ignite subtle revolutions everywhere you go. Explore the frontiers of smart love.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

After studying your astrological omens for the upcoming weeks, I got really excited. There was so much I wanted to tell you. I popped a chunk of organic, fair-trade, cruelty-free, espresso-tinctured chocolate in my mouth and sat down to type an extravagant message. Maybe it was because I was overly pumped up, but in the next moment I accidentally swallowed the candy whole. What a waste! I'd gotten none of the bliss of sliding it around my tongue and mouth. But I recognized this apparent bad luck as a sign of what I needed to tell you: Don't get so worked up about the oncoming pleasures that you engorge them whole without even tasting them.

"The only way to get a difficult feeling to go away is simply to love yourself for it," says author Christiane Northrup. "If you think you're stupid, then love yourself for feeling that way. It's a paradox, but it works. To heal, you must . . . shine the light of compassion on any areas within you that you feel are unacceptable." While I personally believe this is a crafty strategy, I suggest adding a twist in order to double its effectiveness: As you're loving yourself for your difficult feeling, literally laugh out loud at how crazily worried and wound up you are about it.

Here's the first rule of panning for gold: Go to a slow-moving stream where flecks of the precious metal have been found by others in the past. The second rule is this: Although gold is carried along by the current, it's heavier than water and thus rarely appears right on the surface. Look deeper. A third pointer is that if you do ultimately find substantial treasure, it'll be because you will have gradually accumulated a number flakes and nuggets over an extended period of time. You've got to be patient. Now, Aries, apply everything I just said to your search for metaphorical gold.

I'm hoping that by now you're well on your way toward leaving your amateur or rookie status behind for good. I trust that you have had a vision of exactly what you need to do in order to boost your level of professionalism, and that you have taken aggressive steps to carry out that vision. If for some bizarre reason you have not yet begun this glorious work, jumpstart yourself immediately. Fate will conspire dramatically on your behalf if you do. Now here's a tip on how to make sure that your inner warrior is operating at peak efficiency: Assume there's always more you can do to raise your standards and aspire to a higher grade of excellence.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2008, Taurus. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the challenges you were given near the end of last year. One of the tasks at the top of your to-do list, I hope, has been the expansion of your worldview. Whether it occurs by traveling to exotic places, hanging out with broad-minded lovers of life, or exposing yourself to intriguing ideas that activate your deep thoughts, you need to seek out breathtaking views of the big picture. Here are two tips about how to ensure that your inner pioneer is always itchy to investigate the unknown: 1. Shed inhibitions that serve no constructive purpose. 2. Declare your independence from trivial details.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

You entered the Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll phase of your long-term cycle late last year, and you'll be in that zone until January of 2009. That means you have been and will continue to be tempted with triple-intense opportunities to explore the frontiers of passion, find out about alternative modes of consciousness, and expand your capacity for lyrical release. So how is that working for you? Are you taking maximum advantage of all the life-changing experiments these adventures offer without being turned inside-out by the emotional risks they entail? Everything depends on your skill in using unruly gifts.

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2008, Cancerian. We're checking up on how well you're progressing with the challenges you were given near the end of last year. Here's one of the most important things I hope you're doing: getting clear about which of the influences in your life encourage you toward mediocrity, and which influences, on the other hand, nudge you in the direction of mastery. There's a second crucial lesson that's related to the first: getting clear about which people have low expectations and distorted images of you, and which people, on the other hand, want the best for you and see you for who you really are.

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2008, Leo. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the challenges you were given near the end of last year. As I suspect you've guessed by now, there's one potential accomplishment that's more important than all the others. If you can pull it off, it'll change your life forever. I'm talking about the determination to take full responsibility for your own happiness. How? By studying in exquisite detail all the things you need to feel great, and taking aggressive steps to make sure they happen consistently.

This should be the year your self-expression reaches unprecedented levels of vividness and originality.

I hope by now you've realized that you have unprecedented opportunities to forge combinations that have never before been possible. Opposites you'd always assumed would never attract should now be headed toward unification. Elements of your life you've long feared were irreconcilable have been showing signs of finding common ground, and may even be primed to achieve a delicious synergy.

I trust that you've been hungry for new ideas, fresh approaches, and novel adventures. And I hope that this has resulted in you receiving more invitations, dares, and temptations than you've ever had. If what I just said describes your current state of affairs, I extend my hearty congratulations and remind you that you're only half way through this awakening process. If what I said doesn't fit your experience, get busy!

I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and make the following declaration: "This is the hardest I've ever worked to be free. Liberation always came pretty easily to me before, but this year I had to find new ways -- complicated, interesting, highly advanced ways -- to carve out the space to live the life I want. I'm glad I was challenged so deeply. It has made me a genius of emancipation."

I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and make the following declaration: "This year I was a real artist in the way I lived my life. Everything I did was like working on a beautiful masterpiece. I had a sixth sense about when to shut up and when to speak out, when to pull back and when to push on, when to recharge and when to ripen. Whenever my efforts were ready to climax, I brought them to a climax and moved on to the next adventure. So here's the big question: What can I do to keep cultivating this adroit and graceful approach to being alive?"



Want to go further in exploring the Great Mystery that is your life? I discuss the possibilities for the week ahead in your Expanded Audio Horoscope.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

We're halfway through 2008. It's a perfect moment to take inventory of how well you're capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities. So let me ask you, Aries: Are you working your ass off in order to stoke the fire in your belly? In other words, are you doing everything you can think of to get more motivated? Are you trying hard to supercharge your ambitions and refine your passions? If so, this will be the year when you finally figure out how to do what you love to do a majority of the time -- and how to get rewarded by the world for doing it. It's high time to answer your highest calling.



Want a longer, more in-depth PREVIEW of YOUR DESTINY from now through DECEMBER 2008? Normally my Expanded Audio Horoscopes cover just a week at a time. But this week, I'm exploring some of the themes that I think will be important for you during the next six months.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

We're halfway through 2008. It's time to take inventory of how well you're capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities. So let me ask you, Taurus. Have you been climbing out on a limb in order to think outside of the box? Have you been having adventurous fun while experimenting freely? I hope so. Playing around with smart gambles has been and will continue to be the secret to your success. Note well the adjective "smart" in the previous sentence. Dumb gambles and poorly thought-out risks should not be part of your game plan.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Gemini? Now that we're halfway through 2008, let's take an inventory. I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and make the following declaration: "This year I've learned more about togetherness and collaboration than I'd picked up in the previous five years combined. I've finally registered the fact that a successful alliance of any kind requires as much hard work as any job. Most of my important relationships are better and more interesting, and the rest have faded away. I've surprised myself with how creative I've been in finding interesting ways to handle commitment."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Cancerian? Now that we're halfway through 2008, let's take an inventory. I'm hoping that six months from now, you will look back and make the following declaration: "This year I discovered everything that's important to know about what I don't need and who I don't want to be.  That's one of the important reasons why -- hallelujah! -- I've learned to avoid the suffering that comes from wishing my life were different from how it actually is. I'm more at peace with my soul's idiosyncratic destiny than I've ever been."

Leo (July 23-August 22)

We're halfway through 2008. It's time to take inventory of how well you're capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities. So let me ask you, Leo: Have you been redefining your relationship to your job so that it better serves the real you? Are you invoking all your imaginative powers so as to get into a position in which you will love work more than ever before? I hope you've been doing those things, because it means you've primed yourself to attract lots of help in accomplishing those changes.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Virgo? Now that we're halfway through 2008, let's take an inventory. I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and make the following declaration: "I've learned more about love in the past 12 months than maybe I ever have. I've also become far more skilled in the art of making myself happy. And I've finally figured out how to purge some of the martyr-like aspects from my generosity, which means I'm better able to give without strings attached and I'm more attractive to interesting people who are inclined to give me things I really want."

Libra (September 23-October 22)

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Libra? Now that we're halfway through 2008, let's take an inventory. I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and make the following declaration: "It's so funny that in order to find out where I truly belong, I had to change my ideas about where I truly belong. Feeling at home on this planet and in this life wasn't possible until I got cured of my delusions about what it would feel like to be at home on this planet and in this life. I had to lose some of my certainties in order to gain more security."

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Scorpio? Now that we're halfway through 2008, let's take an inventory. One of the most important things you're doing, I hope, is increasing your effectiveness as a communicator. What do I mean by that? While it's true that you Scorpios gather information more skillfully than any other sign, you aren't necessarily as blessed when it comes to sharing information. In part that's because you believe that keeping secrets enhances your personal power. And in part it's because you sometimes forget that other people aren't as clued in to what's happening below the surface as you are. Your mandate in the coming months is to overcome those challenges as you learn to express yourself with ever-greater candor and clarity and clout.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Sagittarius? Now that we're halfway through 2008, let's take an inventory. I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and make the following declaration: "I'm on much friendlier terms with money than I've ever been. I'm sure it's because I have a more rooted and relaxed understanding of my true value, and am not so attached to what other people think I'm worth. I've declared my independence from the conventional wisdom's distorted worship of superficial appearances. Ironically, as I've shaken off the sickening influence of materialism, I've upgraded my ability to create material success."

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Capricorn? Now that we're halfway through 2008, let's take an inventory. Your self-image is in the midst of an exhilarating expansion, right? Your excitement about being alive is growing steadily, right? Your devotion to cultivating an inner sense of freedom is getting more intense every day, right? You have an ever-increasing clarity about what life experiences you need in order to feel powerful, right? If you're falling short in any of these projects, start making up for lost time immediately.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Aquarius? Now that we're halfway through 2008, let's take an inventory. By now, you should have banished at least half of the ghosts that were pestering you. By August, you should have neutralized, dissolved, or rendered irrelevant a load of weird karma, and said goodbye to parts of your past that were bogging you down. By January 1, 2009, I hope you will have laid to rest a broken dream, escaped a dead end, and ended your relationship with a lost cause. If you have spent the last six months earnestly engaged in doing this tough, messy work, it won't be anywhere near as tough and messy during the next six months.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Pisces? Now that we're halfway through 2008, let's take an inventory. You're getting better connected to your community than you ever have before, right? You've become far more purposeful and crafty about forging the alliances you need to be effective, right? You're developing smart strategies for upgrading your unique gifts and givng them to the right people, right? You're working hard to create niches for yourself that suit your temperament and needs, and you're no longer leaving it to other people to shape those niches for you, right?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Successful representations of reality become more important than the reality they represent," writes W. Daniel Hillis at The World Question Center (tinyurl.com/ywth3). Examples: paper money supersedes gold; a painting has more value than the landscape it depicts; the status that an achievement brings begins to overshadow the achievement. The coming days are an excellent time for you to contemplate how this phenomenon might be in play in your life, and whether it's causing any distortions you need to correct. Start with this meditation: Is there any way in which you've become so focused on the map that you have neglected the territory?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Since authoring the book Brazen Careerist: The New Rules for Success, Penelope Trunk has written a blog that offers further advice. Recently she wrote about a subject I'd love for you to think about: mentors. You're in a phase when you have a heightened knack for identifying and attracting and learning from the guides you need. Here's one of Trunk's most crucial points: To take maximum advantage of your teachers, ask them what questions you should be asking them. Don't assume you always know what you need to find out. (You can read Trunk's post here.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Ernest Hemingway said that his best work was a very short story consisting of six words: "For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn." Alan Moore's brief masterpiece of fiction is, I think, just as good: "Machine. Unexpectedly, I¬íd invented a time." Here's another gem, written anonymously: "The last man on earth heard a knock on the door." Your assignment in the coming week, Aries, is to be as pithy as these terse geniuses. Proceed on the assumption that your effectiveness will thrive in direct proportion to your brevity and conciseness. Assume that you will be most likely to get what you want if you use the fewest words and the most minimal actions necessary.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

After working for years in various jobs at San Francisco TV station KTVU, Frank Sommerville was promoted to the top of the heap -- lead anchorman of the 10 o'clock news program. He promised that his new power wouldn't make him lazy or complacent. "Nobody will out-curious me," he bragged. I hope you will adopt the same motto for the foreseeable future, Aries. Your world needs you to be intensely inquisitive about what's transpiring. Uncoincidentally, asking lots of smart questions (and even some dumb ones) will also be the best possible thing you can do for your mental health.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I hope you've been trying to bolster your stick-to-it-iveness, Aries. I trust you've been pumping up your follow-through and supercharging your determination. If you haven't been attending to this unglamorous yet heroic work, play catch-up. Your final exam will be administered no later than May 24. Here's a sneak preview of some of the material you'll be tested on. If a teammate drops the ball, do you: a. quit the game; b. throw the ball in your teammate's face; c. pick up the ball and start running in the direction your teammate was supposed to?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For many Aries, independence is a virtue that flows in abundance -- so much so that it's sometimes on the verge of becoming excessive and turning into a vice. That's why I'm thrilled to inform you that the mysteries of dependence could be especially intriguing and useful to you in the coming days. They might also lead, paradoxically, to a form of interdependence that would in the long run nourish your independence. So how about it? Without compromising your free-wheeling spirit, can you blend yourself more thoroughly with trustworthy souls who care about you?



Where do you want to go? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your power symbol for the week is an ant carrying a potato chip. It means you'll possess so much strength that you'll be able to hold aloft burdens that are much bigger than you. More than that, Aries. You'll look graceful doing it. And here's the kicker. That giant load you carry may ultimately provide nourishment not only for you but also for everyone back at the nest.



Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The U.S. government is spending over $500,000 per minute on the war in Iraq. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil is raking in about $73,000 of profit per minute. Is there any connection? Though I have my suspicions, I don't know for sure. I do know that the coming weeks will be an excellent time for you to phase out any situation in your personal life that resembles America's cash drain in Iraq. It will also be a favorable period for you to brainstorm about how you could upgrade your financial intake to be more like Exxon Mobil's.



What blessings will life bring you? What challenges will you be invited to dive into? To explore the ripening trends further, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead. You can also listen to my three-part long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2008.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A reader from Fiji is encouraging me to pay a visit. "Fiji is heaven on earth," she says. "You'll be ecstatic here." While I have no doubt that's true, it's hard for me to imagine being any more ecstatic than I am when I travel to Hawaii. It, too, has resemblances to paradise. And the plane flight there takes five hours less and is $600 cheaper than the jaunt to Fiji. Do I really need a more heavenly heaven on earth than, say, Waimoku Falls Trail in Maui? I expect you're facing a metaphorically similar situation, Aries. The question you may want to ask yourself is this: Should you pine and aim for a state beyond perfection, or will mere perfection serve you just as well?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

High-definition TV makes everything look more vivid than standard broadcast technology. Images are so high-quality they almost appear 3-D. While this is enjoyable to viewers, some performers are uncomfortable with the way it reveals their skin's imperfections. Did you know that Brad Pitt has acne scars? I predict a metaphorically similar development for you in the coming weeks, Aries. Every little thing you do will be more highly visible and have greater impact than before. Wherever you've been 2-D, you'll become 3-D. That could turn out really well for you if you take it as a challenge to fine-tune your commitment to excellence and integrity.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the film Fight Club, the character played by Brad Pitt storms into a convenience store with a gun, then herds the clerk out back and threatens to execute him. While the poor man quivers in terror, Pitt asks him questions about himself, extracting the confession that he had once wanted to be a veterinarian but had dropped out of school. After a few minutes, Pitt frees the clerk without harming him, but says that unless he takes steps to return to veterinary school in the next six weeks, he will hunt him down and kill him. In my opinion, that's an overly extreme way to motivate someone to do what's good for him. I wish I could come up with a less shocking approach to coax you into resuming the quest for your deferred dreams, Aries. Can you think of anything?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's a good time to start preparing for the shocks that will arrive when the Mayan calendar ends on December 21, 2012. Some measures to consider: Learn how to use a gun, live off the grid, and gather edible plants that grow in the wild. APRIL FOOL! Everything I jut said was a histrionic lie. Here's my real message: The period leading up to the winter solstice in 2012, as well as that day itself, will bring no more than the usual rate of breakdowns and breakthroughs that has characterized the last two decades. Of course, that's still more novelty per year than previous generations experienced in a lifetime. But you've become pretty good at adapting, haven't you? This week I suggest you expand your mind even further about the massive transformations we're in the midst of, and think about how you can become even more skilled at constantly changing.



How much do you want to know about your destiny? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your intriguing fate, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead. You can also listen to my three-part long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2008.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Bible says you should kill adulterers, homosexuals, and brides who aren't virgins (Leviticus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 22:21). But I beg you not to do any such thing. The good book also asserts that it's OK to beat your servants as long as you don't go too far and murder them (Exodus 21:21). Again, I ask you to ignore this advice. I furthermore pray that you won't circumcise your heart, as recommended in Jeremiah 9:26. In general, Aries, it's an excellent time to free yourself from insidious absurdities that seeped into your brain from outmoded books, stale traditions, or sketchy teachings and theories you opened yourself to when you were younger. Seek out the inspiring shock of freshly minted wisdom.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

He "cleans up well" is prison lingo. It refers to a convict who, upon leaving jail, is able to overhaul his appearance and demeanor so thoroughly that no one can tell he has served time. I believe that in the coming weeks you will have access to another version of this skill. You will so completely erase the traces of your own personal version of "incarceration" that everyone will assume that you've always been a free bird.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This is Celebrate Your Broken Heart Week, Aries. Even if your heart's not exactly shattered at the moment, it has no doubt been so at sometime in the past. So why celebrate? Because having a broken heart is one of the best things that can happen to you. It strengthens your humility, which makes you smarter. It demonstrates to you that you have a tremendous capacity for deep feelings -- far more than you're normally aware of. It breaks down defense mechanisms that have desensitized you to the world's secret beauty. It should also inspire you to treat other people's hearts with great care, making it more likely you'll be able to create intelligent intimacy in the future. Here's what I conclude: A broken heart is a gift the world gives you to awaken you to the truth about what matters to you most.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead. You can also listen to my three-part long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2008.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

What's the opposite of a freak out? Let's call it a freak in. I suspect you're about to enter into this state. That means you will have at your disposal all the intensity of a hysterical fit, but you'll be able to express it artfully as you accomplish acts of amazing grace. Time may even seem to expand for you as you slip into a wildly relaxed perspective that unleashes exuberant insights with practical applications.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm 99 percent positive that in the coming week you will not wind up in a hand-to-hand battle on top of a speeding truck with a rogue agent of the secret government. It's also highly unlikely that the next time you open your closet door you will be forced to engage in magical combat with a well-dressed goblin from the fifth level of hell. On the other hand, Aries, it might actually be wise for you to instigate a fair fight in a safe place with a good person who is basically your ally. You two need to air out some buried tensions in order to get the most out of your future collaborations.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Happy Valentine Daze, Aries! After meditating about what advice would be most useful for your love life during the rest of 2008, I decided on this observation from 17th-century philosopher Sir Francis Bacon: "There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion." In other words, you should raise your appreciation for interesting idiosyncrasies and cute "flaws" and odd proportions. They are not inconvenient imperfections that mar the beauty you need in your life. They are the very essence of it.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Men should be barred from holding public office for 100 years," says billionaire Ted Turner. "Men have been running the world for too long and they've made a mess of it." If women were in charge, he adds, "It would be a much more peaceful, prosperous, equitable world in a very short period of time. You'd have a huge shift away from military budgets and into education and health care." I agree with everything Turner said except when he implied that men should be prohibited from serving. That's totalitarian, the exact opposite of what I trust a feminine majority would usher in. From an astrological perspective, by the way, 2008 is prime time to move forcefully in the direction of bringing more women into power. And it so happens that Aries people of both genders are best able to lead the way. To jumpstart your ability to fulfill this potential, I urge you to take three actions in the coming week to foster female authority. Men, you may devote two of these to boosting your inner woman.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
The Onion newspaper reported on a South Carolina man who was so grateful for what God had done in the previous week that he put an extra $5 in the collection plate at church on Sunday. Brad Thaden was especially pleased with the nice weather and how well his kids had behaved. I expect that by February 18, Aries, you too might feel the urge to give Supreme Being a tip, or do whatever the equivalent might be in your world. Among the extra perks you could be blessed with: a deeper connection with a resource you've wanted to be closer to; the heating up of a promising alliance; a social upgrade that will make you feel more at home in the world; and a vision of where to go next with your ambitions.=

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year," said essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson. That's my first suggestion for you this week, Aries. Now, while you're at the energetic peak of your astrological cycle, is a good time to cultivate a knack for identifying the specific gift that each day has to offer you. You will also resonate well with the cosmic rhythms if you make use of another Emersonian gem: "Every great and commanding moment in the annals of the world is the triumph of some enthusiasm." Where does your purest enthusiasm lie? And how will you use it to fuel your ascent to a series of great and commanding moments?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I urge you to spend 2008 turning all of your pretty good but half-developed notions into a few brilliant, fully formed ideas. While you're at it, melt down your hundreds of wishy-washy wishes and recast them into three driving desires. This is the Year of Pinpoint Aim, Aries, also known as the Year of Lasering Your Focus and the Year of Seeing with Fierce Clarity. Psyche yourself up for a major campaign to cut the crap so the essence can shine.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"My calling hasn't called yet," wrote Rennie, an Aries reader from Austin. "Please, Rob, say a prayer to all the applicable gods and angels, asking them to do whatever it takes to make sure that I am at home when it finally does." I've got good news for Rennie. Many Aries who have never before had a hint about their calling will be able to gather many clues in 2008. Meanwhile, those of your tribe who have already found their higher purpose will be evolving it to a much deeper level. To help ensure that all the magic unfolds, I have unleashed a fist-pumping prayer to the goddess of mission plans, urging her to invite you Rams to claim the empowering joy that comes from being united with your source code.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The longest waves on the planet unfurl in the place where the Atlantic Ocean flows into the mouth of the Amazon River. The phenomenon is called the "pororoca" (from a word meaning "tumultuous noise"), and has become a favorite challenge for surfers. In 2003, a Brazilian daredevil named Picuruta Salazar rode a single wave for 37 minutes, gliding and plowing for almost eight miles. Judging from your current astrological omens, Taurus, I'd say that's an apt metaphor for the kind of wave you now have the chance to jump on. If you choose to give it a whirl, don't plan for a short sweet burst of adrenaline. Be ready for a long, rollicking balancing act.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

This is a very favorable time to discover what has been hidden from you, to strip away disguises, and to penetrate to the real story that has been buried by the official propaganda. You're also likely to generate luck if you go in search of buried treasure, lost keys, and missing links. To help you achieve success in these noble if sometimes stealthy goals, keep in mind the advice of inventor George Washington Carver: "Anything will give up its secrets if you love it enough."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Mirrors can be powerful tools and useful symbols for you in the coming days. When is the last time you gazed serenely into your own eyes for at least ten minutes? Try it! If you're brave, go on from there: Actually talk to the interesting creature you see reflected back at you. Ask questions. Give advice. Sing songs. And if you're even braver, move on to the next project: Bring a friend or loved one to the mirror, and converse with each other's images. Tell each other the kinds of raw, shimmering truths that can only be revealed in a mirror.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

At the Plow & Hearth stores, you can buy realistic boulders "to disguise your yard problems." These gigantic plastic monstrosities, which sell for $90, are hollow inside and fit right over the pipes, holes, and other eyesores you want to hide. In the coming days, Leo, you might want to consider acquiring a metaphorical version of this item. There's a big old messy place in your kingdom that seems to be getting bigger and messier. It's high time to either conceal it or clean it up.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The U.K. newspaper The Independent reports that avid reader Mark Bastable consumed the collected works of D.H. Lawrence and found "not a single laugh, not a wry chuckle, not even a quiet grin in the entire po-faced oeuvre." If that's true, I say we put an asterisk on the covers of his books, similar to the mark that will go on the home run record of the allegedly steroid-enhanced baseball star Barry Bonds. In D.H.'s case, the asterisk will denote that he won a place in the literature hall of fame despite having never expressed the second-most essential human emotion. In any case, Virgo, don't you dare read Lawrence in the next four weeks. You need to be surrounded by influences that will encourage you to look for humor and amusement in every single thing you do.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

In 15 million years, Los Angeles will be a suburb of San Francisco. It will take that long for the constant slipping of the San Andreas Fault to push the southern city 400 miles north. That will be lucky for the people alive then, since they won't have to travel far to enjoy the distinctive pleasures of two of the West Coast's finest cultural centers. In your case, Libra, you don't have to wait so long. I predict that two of your personal centers of gravity will combine by the end of 2008. Your divided sense of home will disappear, allowing you to feel more united than you've been in years.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Why does human anatomy include the organ known as the appendix? For centuries, doctors have been unable to determine its purpose. Most have decided it's unnecessary, a vestigial structure left over from an earlier stage of evolution. But recent research suggests the conventional wisdom has to be revised. In fact, the appendix seems to protect and regenerate the good bacteria that live in the intestines. I predict that you're on the verge of a metaphorically comparable discovery, Scorpio. Something you have always considered to be useless or irrelevant will reveal its value.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Astronomers say that the Sagittarius Galaxy is being devoured by our own galaxy. It's getting stretched, rearranged, and assimilated by our massive gravity. I'd like to offer up this scenario as a metaphor for you to put into play in the coming week, Sagittarius. Imagine all the fun and interesting ways that you yourself could be "eaten." Maybe you could get absorbed into an exciting social scene, or be integrated into an institution you love, or become part of a movement you've admired from afar. And maybe you could simply do what's necessary to get yourself kissed, licked, and sucked all over.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The Wind Horse is a mythical creature in Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Symbolizing vigorous life force, it embodies the quick, cleansing power of the wind and the primal vitality of the horse. In accordance with your astrological omens, Capricorn, I nominate this archetype to be your ruling metaphor in the coming weeks. Visualize yourself being accompanied by a Wind Horse everywhere you go. See yourself riding it, feeding it, playing with it. Call on its inspiring presence as you align yourself with the natural beneficence of the universe. Ask it to help you sweep obstacles out of the way as you attract a flow of opportunities to open your mind and heart.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

This will be an excellent week for you to buy $50 worth of silence. And to hang around people who won't try to coax you or manipulate you into doing anything. And to wander out into a barren wilderness -- the Mars-like landscape of the crater near the summit of Maui's Mt. Haleakala would be ideal -- and howl wordless, senseless, empty-headed melodies to a god who may or may not exist. Do you catch my drift, Aquarius? You are likely to attract cosmic luck and generate useful serendipity if you can achieve a state that combines Zen Buddhism's "beginner's mind" with the attitude Henry Miller enjoyed when he said, "I have no money, no resources, no hopes. I am the happiest man alive."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"The stars would love to influence your future," reported a horoscope for Pisces in The Onion newspaper, "but they are powerless against your well-established patterns of behavior." While this might sometimes be an accurate statement, it's not true now. The next three weeks will be a very favorable time for you to escape well-established patterns of behavior, especially the ones that are no damn good for you. Here's a bonus perk: You will also have marked success if you not only rebel against your habits but also against the stars' influence. The upshot of all this good news is that you'll be in prime time to unleash your freest free will.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Do you know what an expansion joint is? No, it's not slang for a marijuana cigarette you smoke in hopes of enlarging your worldview. Rather, it's an architectural term referring to the flexible sections that are built into a bridge or brick wall. These ensure that the structure can safely adjust as its construction materials expand and contract in response to changing weather and temperature. Since I expect that you will be building a new metaphorical edifice or renovating an existing one in 2008, I wanted to get you thinking about this. Expansion joints should be a key element in your plans. In fact, now is a perfect time to meditate on how to make them and where they will go.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The average person changes residences 11 times in the course of his or her life. Having lived in 33 different homes so far, I'm way above the norm. What about you, Taurus? I'm guessing that you will either make a major move in the coming year, or else you will find your true spiritual home. Here's a third possibility: You may penetrate more deeply into your existing abode, transforming it from a place of shelter to a sublime sanctuary -- re-imagining it and reinventing it and reinhabiting it with an intensity that amazes you.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I'm guessing your heart will be smarter than usual in 2008. At the very least, love won't make you stupid, as it sometimes has in the past. Here's a suggestion to help ensure that your higher intelligence is always guiding your decisions about intimacy: Develop a habit of looking for the best in your intimate companions. I hope that in the coming months you will frequently utter declarations like the following: (1) "I love how you give me your full attention when we talk." (2) "I love how in touch you are with yourself." (3) "I love that you can make me laugh even when I'm mad." (4) "I love your impeccable sense of timing -- how you call or show up at the right moment." (5) "I love how free you make me feel to tell the absolute truth." (These words of praise and more were lifted from the book What I Love Most About You.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In the fifth century B.C., the culturally rich city-state of Athens was a democracy, while militaristic Sparta was a dictatorship. But they put aside their differences and came together in a great collaboration to fight off the Persian invasion of Greece. I suspect you may make a similar move in 2008, Cancerian. A person or institution you have regarded as an adversary could become your ally. An influence from which you have always set yourself apart may help you pull off a feat of strength you couldn't have done otherwise.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"It's now possible to fake everything," writes David M. Hopkins in his book Counterfeiting Exposed. He's not just referring to digitally altered photos of celebrities and singers who lip-sync to pre-recorded vocals during their supposed live performances. He means everything in the world, from vintage wines to famous paintings to designer jeans. At least five percent of all products on the planet are phony. I bring this to your attention, Leo, because I'm putting you on high alert for frauds and cons and deceptions of every kind. You should be the top whistleblower of the zodiac in 2008, the chief bullshit-detector and constructive critic.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Your main assignment in 2008 is to become highly skilled at feeling good. Does that sound like something you might want to do? If so, here's the beginning of a regimen you could follow: (1) Be constantly taking notes about what experiences give you delight and what situations make you feel at home in the world. (2) Always be scheming to provide yourself with those experiences and situations. (3) Take a vow that nothing will obstruct you from seeking out and creating pleasure, peace, love, wonder, and an intimate connection with life.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Too much aggression is dangerous," writes George R. Elder in his book An Encyclopedia of Archetypal Symbolism, "but, then, so is too little." One of your main assignments in 2008, Libra, draws on that wise counsel. Unfortunately, you don't have any good role models who can demonstrate how to gracefully express just the right amount of sinewy force. Everyone's either too pushy or too meek. You're going to have to figure out how to pull off this subtle yet momentous feat all by yourself.

"Dear Rob: Here are my New Year's resolutions. (1) I vow to Siamese-twin together my bad-ass, no-hype, wide-eyed self with my tricky, strategic, puzzle-loving self. (2) I vow to rage on like a dancing warrior in the urban wilderness, keeping peak experiences and total slaphappy victory at the top of my priority list, while at the same time I play hide-and-seek with the dark delicious secrets that fuel my soul's lust for wicked meaning. (3) I vow to deepen the collaborative efforts of my suck-out-the-marrow-and-spit-out-the-bones craziness and my listen-carefully-to-the-flow-of-the-underground-river caginess. -Double Intense Scorpio." Dear Double Intense: Scorpios everywhere will benefit from hearing your resolutions, which is why I've made them 2008's first horoscope.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In my dream, I was addressing a crowd of Sagittarians in a festively decorated hall. It was the first week of 2008. "You are not yet ready for the wonderful things you think you want," I told them. "To actually get them, you will have to change yourself in the coming months; you will have to shed some old conditioning that is interfering with your quest for success. Do you know what that old conditioning is? Find out NOW! Figure out how you need to transform yourself in order for the world to give you what you yearn for."

Do you ever wonder if God loves Brad Pitt and Paris Hilton more than he loves you, as seemingly evidenced by those celebrities' charmed lives? Do you suspect that Tiger Woods' fame and Bill Gates' wealth mean that fate is friendlier to them that it is to you? If so, you're in for a major surprise, Capricorn. Events in 2008 will bring you big deliveries of the next best things to riches and fame. You'll get more proof than you've had in a long time that God and fate adore you.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

As I began my hike around the lake, I asked the spirits for a vision that would serve as a symbol of your life in 2008. "Give me a sign," I said aloud, gazing to the heavens. Soon I came upon two rattlesnakes copulating on the path ahead of me. It was a beautiful ruckus. I stopped a few yards back to watch, reasoning that they were too preoccupied with each other to attack me. When they finally disengaged, I retreated. Just then I saw a very pregnant woman approaching me. She was walking alone with her head down, lost in thought. I called her attention to the snakes and convinced her that for the sake of our well-being, we should flee the scene. And that, Aquarius, was the sign I asked the spirits to send me about your life in 2008. What does it mean? That's for you to meditate on. Here's a hint: Appreciate and learn all you can from the beautiful ruckus you'll encounter, but preferably from a safe distance. And be protective of other people who may be more vulnerable or less alert than you.

"I must create a system, or be enslaved by another man's," wrote visionary poet William Blake. I suggest you write out that quote and keep it in plain sight throughout 2008. The coming months will be prime time for you to design a highly organized, richly disciplined approach to living the life you want to live, and doing it with such rigor and vigor that you will never again have to be controlled by or pay constant homage to someone else's life plan.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When the Red Hot Chili Peppers released their fifth album Blood Sugar Sex Magick in 1991, it blasted them into rock stardom. They stopped performing at intimate nightclubs and appeared exclusively at large arenas. They won a Grammy, had a hit song at the top of the charts, and sold millions of records. Guitarist John Frusciante freaked out at the success. As an indie artist intensely loyal to the underground sensibility, he was embarrassed to be in a band that had mainstream popularity. In the middle of the Chili Peppers' tour, he quit. You may very well have to deal with a comparable development in 2008, Aries. Will you opt to remain low-profile, as Frusciante did, or will you answer the invitation to get more professional?

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

When China's Three Gorges Dam finally becomes fully operational in 2009, the hydroelectric power it generates will provide renewable energy to a sizable portion of the population. As a replacement for coal consumption, it will also eliminate 100 million tons of greenhouse gases. That's the good news. The bad news is that it will require a thousand towns and villages to be permanently flooded, forcing over a million people to leave their homes. I believe you may be faced with a comparable option in 2008, Taurus. If you're willing to deal with displacement and the loss of traditions, you will gain access to tremendous reserves of pure mojo.

Would you like to own a 60-inch flat-screen HDTV plasma television with surround-sound speakers? How about a $6,000 Daniel Hanson bathrobe made of silk-trimmed pashmina, a diamond-encrusted Cartier Luxury watch, and a heated toilet seat? All of these wonders and more could be within your grasp in 2008. In my astrological opinion, however, going after them would be a waste of your substantial acquisitive potential, which would be better used in pursuit of less decadent valuables. Such as? Such as tools and training that will help you upgrade your skills and refine the unique gifts you have to give the world.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

For millennia, human beings have sought and received help from spiritual beings who are imperceptible to the senses. "Among the North American Indians, but not among them alone," wrote Carl Jung's gifted student Erich Neumann (1905-1960), "the essential content of initiation is the acquisition of an individual 'guardian spirit.'" It's unfortunate that modern Western culture, still in the chokehold of the materialist delusion, makes it challenging for anyone alive today to tap into the supernatural blessings that so many of our forbears enjoyed. But I believe you will be able to overcome this disadvantage in 2008, Cancerian. There's a good chance you will figure out what it takes to establish direct communion with a spiritual ally.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Picture a full-grown lion with a thin, two-foot-long string tied around one of its back legs. The other end of the string is tethered to a short wooden stake lodged in the dirt. The lion seems to think it's held captive, and never tries to escape. It's restless and frustrated, periodically emitting a doleful sound that's both a pained growl and a mournful whine. I want you to think of this scene at least once a month in 2008, Leo. Each time, ask yourself, "Am I the lion that Rob Brezsny described?" Make sure you always know that you can snap the string with ease and bound away to freedom.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The desert-dwelling creosote bush can survive for centuries on little water. In the Mohave Desert there is a ring of creosote, named "King Clone," whose age has been carbon-dated at 11,700 years. The hardiness of this low-maintenance wonder reminds me of you, Virgo. You sometimes entertain the fantasy that the less you need, the stronger you'll be. The downside of this attitude is that you may unwittingly make it hard for people to give you their gifts. The upside is that you've learned many secrets about how to nurture and take care of yourself. But in 2008, I foresee you making a shift away from the creosote bush metaphor. You're more likely to resemble a tomato bush that gets watered regularly.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Lake Vostok is as big as Lake Ontario, but no one on earth knew about it until 1996. Scientists who had been drilling through Antarctica's thick sheets of ice discovered it two miles below the surface. Here's what they were able to find out about the ancient lake: Hermetically sealed off for at least a half million years, it gets no sunlight, has an average temperature below zero, and may harbor life forms as exotic as those on other planets. And yes, it's in a liquid state, for reasons you can read about at tinyurl.com/2lq79d. All that, Libra, is prelude to the following announcement: Lake Vostok will be one of your Prime Metaphors in 2008. I predict you will dig deep to discover an ancient, pristine mystery at the bottom of your life. In my astrological opinion, you should explore it thoroughly, driven by both an innocent sense of wonder and a robust analytical curiosity.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

You're pretty smart, Scorpio, but would you like to become even smarter in 2008? It's quite possible that you will get more skilled at managing and solving your personal problems. You may also become a better judge of character and develop a brilliant knack for knowing what's good for you. There's one main thing you have to do in order to ensure that you will fully activate these potentials: Become more generous. Here's your thought for the year, courtesy of Eleanor Roosevelt: "The giving of love is an education it itself."

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

The number of millionaires on the planet increased more than nine percent last year. Judging from the astrological omens, I'm betting that the growth rate in the coming year will be similar. A disproportionately large amount of the newly wealthy in 2008, however, will be Sagittarians. And even those of you who don't make it to a million will probably get richer quicker than you have in more than a decade -- especially if you make that your intention.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The Greek philosopher Aristotle said that when new facts and ideas emerge, we should be willing to coin fresh words to convey the unfamiliar information. Do you agree? If so, be ready to dream up a steady stream of new terms in 2008. I bet you'll encounter more novelty than you have since 1996. Dead language and stale clich√©s won't be sufficient to wrestle the meaning out of your unprecedented experiences. To jumpstart your receptivity to made-up words, try this one: freakomancy. It refers to the art of divining the future by noticing the most unusual and anomalous elements present in any given situation.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

One of the planet's highest active volcanoes is Mt. Cotopaxi in Ecuador. It also happens to be the site of the world's only equatorial glacier. Please visit this complex place sometime in 2008. If that's not possible, at least promise me that you will vividly imagine yourself there. Why? Because in order to bring out the best in yourself in the coming months, I think you will need to be fueled by a visceral sense of what it's like when primal opposites coexist.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

When I first learned about Jupiter in grade school, my science textbook said the planet had 12 moons. Years later, thanks to better telescopes and data returned by America's Voyager spacecrafts, we know that at least 63 moons are orbiting the solar system's largest planet. I expect an equally dramatic expansion will unfold for you in 2008, Pisces. At this time next year, your social network should be much bigger than it is now. You may even be at the center of a Jovian-style web of connections.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Ambition is a bad excuse for not having enough good sense to be lazy," my ex-girlfriend Arlene used to say. She claimed to be a Zen master whose duty it was to deprogram me out of my absurd striving to make something of myself. She believed the key to enlightenment was to do nothing as much as possible. "You're egotistically attached to your identity as a poet," she'd yell into my room as I toiled over my writing. "Come out here and show me you have the spiritual guts to sit in front of the TV and lose your grandiose self in a meaningless game show." While I did eventually emerge from our relationship with an appreciation for the value of emptiness, it was not ultimately my destiny to downplay ambition. On the contrary! Which is why I'm here to exhort you, Aries, to treat your desires as sacred rocket fuel -- in 2008, more than ever. In the coming months, in accordance with your astrological omens, I will intensify my efforts to supercharge your ambition.



This week my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES offer you a preview of some of the major themes you will be working and playing with in 2008. Then, beginning December 25, I will devote three consecutive weeks of EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES to an in-depth discussion of your long-range outlook for the coming 12 months. Tune in!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Everything absolute belongs to pathology. Joyous distrust is a sign of health." So proclaimed Friedrich Nietzsche. Note well that he used the adjective "joyous" to describe distrust, not "cynical" or "grumbling" or "sour." The key to remaining vital and strong while questioning every so-called absolute is to cultivate a cheerful, buoyant mood as you do it. That's one of your top assignments in the coming weeks, Aries: Practice joyous distrust.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This would be an excellent time for you to visit terminally ill patients in a hospice or go on a tour of a maximum security prison. To take maximum advantage of the current cosmic opportunities, you might also travel to the Slum Theme Park in Americus, Georgia, where Habitat for Humanity has built replicas of the leaky-roofed, earthen-floored, bug-infested huts that so many millions of the world's poor call home. In other words, Aries, I recommend that you give yourself firsthand exposure to people whose problems are much more demanding than yours. To do so at this juncture in your life's journey would provide a helpful shock that would inspire you to conquer the personal challenge you find most daunting.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

How much more can you hold? How much further are you willing to reach? How much bigger of a big picture can you open your mind to see? We will soon discover the answers to those questions, as well as several others that have to do with the themes of unbinding, emancipation, and the loss of inhibition. Judging from my reading of the astrological omens, I'd say the prospects are high for you to achieve a record-breaking state of relaxed and curious expansiveness.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When life gets weird, should you take refuge in decorum and tradition? Should you intensify your commitment to the humdrum? Is it wise to dress more conservatively, act more dignified, and smile more automatically? I say no. When the daily rhythm veers off track into unexpected detours, I say it's prime time to gleefully depart from The Way Things Have Always Been Done. In fact, I advise you to cultivate your rebellious questions and celebrate the unusual impulses that bubble up. They will help you harvest the epiphanies that life's weirdness is tempting you to pursue.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I love it when you forget all your troubles and get lost in thoughts about your friends' problems. I love it when you place your entire focus on the heat steaming from your cup of coffee or on the sun reflecting on a puddle or on the mysterious expression gracing the face of a stranger. In fact I love it whenever you prove how much you love being here on earth by taking your attention off yourself, and giving it to everything else. The coming week will be a perfect time to specialize in this consummate art.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Read these lines by Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai, translated by Chana Block and Stephen Mitchell: "A flock of sheep near the airport or a high voltage generator beside the orchard: these combinations open up my life like a wound, but they also heal it. That's why my feelings always come in twos." Draw inspiration from this passage. Rather than experiencing the riddles and contradictions of your life merely as painful schisms, think of them also as mysterious unifications.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A top official at the European Robotics Research Network predicts that humans will "be having sex with robots" sooner than anyone expected  -- probably within four years. I hope this little shocker will help motivate you to follow my astrological advice for the coming week, which is to flee in the opposite direction of that trend. Start by phasing out any robotic, machine-like behavior that may have crept into the way you make love. For that matter, deprogram yourself of any automatic, lifeless habits that are infecting your approach to expressing intimacy, tenderness, and togetherness.



What blessings will life bring you in the coming week? What challenges will you be invited to dive into? To explore the ripening trends further, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For all we know, in your past life you were a virgin who was thrown into a volcano to appease a fire deity. But whether or not that's an actual fact, we can say this with certainty: At some time in your current life, you made a great sacrifice in an effort to pacify a person whose anger or violence or manipulativeness you were intimidated by. Now I say unto you, Aries, that it's an excellent time to fix any distortions that were unleashed in your life because of that sacrifice. You've got the personal power and insight you need to set the healing in motion. Halloween costume suggestions: the mythical phoenix; a virgin-turned-warrior carrying the severed head of the fire deity; a fireman, firewoman, or firedancer.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In his book The Primary Colors, Alexander Theroux writes that yellow is the color of "early bruises, forbidding skies, dead leaves, dental plaque, foul curtains, speed bumps, and callused feet." And yet, he muses, yellow is also the color of "the generous sun, butter, candlelight, ripening grain, translucent amber, and spring itself." I suspect that in the coming week, Aries, you will have encounters with a situation that is as paradoxical as yellow. Whether your experience is more like wrapping yourself in foul curtains or basking in the generous sun may depend largely on whether you summon a determination to see the best in everything.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm not necessarily recommending that you read Stanely Seigel's book The Patient Who Cured His Therapist. But I do think you should regard the title as a suggestive metaphor for your immediate future. It's possible that you'll be helped by a person you've been helping, or be given gifts by person to whom you've given gifts. Could it be that you'll be healed by someone you imagine you're superior to, or taught a beautiful lesson by someone you don't understand? Meditate on the ways you might be the beneficiary of a role reversal.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Vegan Erotica is a company that sells S & M bondage gear suitable for vegans. Its whips, harnesses, collars, cuffs, and restraints are made of fake leather. So it's now possible for you to conduct puckish experiments with sexual power dynamics and yet not be responsible for harming any animals in the process. This development serves as an apt metaphor for your current astrological omens, Aries, which recommend a paradoxical blend of tenderness and force, a judicious mix of compassionate concern and playful aggressiveness, and daring attempts to pull off mischievous healings.



How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your intriguing fate, tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your first assignment is to practice feeling that everywhere you go you are standing on holy ground. Capitalize that phrase in your imagination -- "I AM STANDING ON HOLY GROUND" -- as you move through the world. Your second assignment, which may at first seem unrelated, is to kick your evil twin's ass. Do it tenderly and compassionately, with full awareness that both you and your evil twin are standing on holy ground. But don't stop kicking until you convince your evil twin to take greater responsibility for his or her personal share of the world's darkness.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the Yaghan language of Tierra del Fuego, mamihlapinatapai is a word meaning "gazing into each other's eyes, each hoping that the other will initiate something that both desire but which neither one wants to start." If I'm reading the astrological omens correctly, you've been experiencing some version of this poignant deadlock lately. It may have made sense for you to refrain from making the first move up until now, but it no longer does. Get yourself in a generous mood and provide the jumpstart you've both been hesitant to try.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Metaphorically speaking, I foresee glacier ice melting and molten rock flowing in your immediate future, Aries. I expect that hard solids will become fluid; permanent fixtures will be in flux. This is a good thing, believe me. Though it may unnerve you at first, you will have the power to change things you never thought could be changed in a hundred years. You will have the freedom to create new vessels for energy that has outgrown its old vessels.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A few years ago, the Cambodian government decided that the country's karaoke bars had become hotbeds of vice. To suppress their evil influence, the prime minister called out the army's bulldozers and demolished them. Keep that in mind as an example of how NOT to proceed in the coming week, Aries. While the astrological omens do suggest that you should phase out bad and inferior influences from your life, they also warn against resorting to overkill. As you rightfully purge the weird karma lingering in your vicinity, don't create a new batch of weird karma.

"Here's how you can tell if you have a bad psychotherapist or counselor," says my friend Laura. "She or he buys into all your BS, never questions your delusions, and builds your self-esteem even if that makes you into an a**hole." I agree with Laura's assessment, which is why I'm going to spend our short time together today calling you on your BS, prodding you to get introspective about your delusions, and not pumping up the parts of your ego that really should be melted down. Next week maybe we'll get back to gazing adoringly into each other's eyes, but right now you'll benefit from some tough love.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You've been putting out and putting out and putting out, Aries. Good work! I'm impressed with the blend of high-minded generosity and ego-boosting self-expression you've synergized. Now, however, it's time to make a transition. You need to start taking in and taking in and taking in. Your radiance needs to be fed by other radiances. Congratulate yourself for how aggressive you've been, then cultivate an equally robust receptivity.

"Dear Rob: Have your apprentices been composing your column lately? Or have you outsourced the writing to Vedic fortune-tellers in Calcutta? The horoscopes just don't sound like you. They're, I don't know, goofier or something. Have you been smoking more dope than usual? - Lonely for the Old Rob." Dear Lonely: I always write every horoscope, and I never take drugs. In fact, I think it's YOU that have changed. Many of you Aries have been so deeply immersed in mutation lately that you don't realize how much you've mutated. You assume everyone around you is different only because you don't know how different you've become.

"The face is the most erotic part of the body," says fashion designer Vivienne Westwood. Try out that perspective for a while, Aries. Your assignment in the coming week is to enjoy getting excited by faces that captivate your imagination. This isn't just about pure physical beauty, of course. You should also be alert to the titillating wisdom and arousing compassion that are revealed in their features . . . as well as the ripples of inscrutable emotions and the flows of secret knowings.

Would you like to shed your soul's baby fat without having to go on a diet? Do you want to supercharge your immune system, improve your memory for the events that really matter, and build the spiritual power of your sexual feelings? Are you interested in postponing forehead wrinkles, getting glimpses of your beautiful future, and diminishing your fascination with the media's nihilism? The secrets to pulling off these possibilities will be more available to you than ever before in the coming weeks. And what's the best way to ensure you'll gather them in? Open your heart. I mean really open your heart -- with a relentlessly tender intensity.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Writing in Poetry Flash, critic Rusty Morrison speculates that "the sublime can only be glimpsed by pressing through fear's boundary, beyond one's previous conceptions of the beautiful." That's a good theme for you to experiment with right now, Aries. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you're very close to making contact with splendor you'll remember all your life. (And I don't use that fancy word "splendor" lightly.) You'll need a lot of playful courage to make the boundary-crossing. But I know you can do it if you keep heading in the direction of what's scarily meaningful.

I think this would be a good standard for all of us to live up to: to molt our personas, or social masks, at least once a year. It's that time for you, Aries.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Here's how you damage the Aries soul, according to astrologer Steven Forrest: You bore it, you deprive it of adventure, and you starve it of chances to grow evermore courageous. I'm worried this could happen in the coming weeks. According to my reading of the omens, you may be tempted to get involved with things that are too easy for you. Here's what you can do to make sure this doesn't come to pass: Invite yourself into unpredictable situations. Give yourself assignments that will force you out of your comfort zone. Fall in love with questions that will turn your mind inside-out.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Among the Yanyuwa Aboriginal people who live along the coast of Australia's Northern Territory, the word for "fat" is nalu-ngiliny. It doesn't merely refer to the greasy stuff that grows naturally under the skin of animal bodies. It's also a metaphysical term for vitality. Anything that's rich in nalu-ngiliny is healthy. A certain landscape may be considered fat, for instance, which means that it's fertile and sacred. When acacia flowers bloom each year, it's a sign that sea turtles and the marine mammals known as dugongs, favorite foods of the Yanyuwa, are "fat" and ready to be hunted. Your assignment in the coming week is to identify the things in your life that are nalu-ngiliny, and to give them the honor, gratitude, and nurturing they deserve.

The bad news: Charlie and Sharon Reed, a couple in Dallas, had their old VW convertible stolen. The good news: By the time police recovered the car three months later, the thieves had given it a new paint job, and had fixed its cracked windshield and dented bumpers. Let's make this your metaphor of the week, Aries. I predict that you, too, will be reunited with something you lost, and it will be in better shape than it was before you were separated.

I hope that by now you're seeing how much you have to learn. This has been and will continue to be an ideal time to act like a student in every phase of your life. But I also hope you've started to realize how much you have to offer as a role model, mentor, and guide. Amazingly, this is a year when you can generate unpredictable magic as both a student and a teacher.

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2007, Gemini. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the long-term tasks you were assigned six months ago. I hope that you've been working hard to upgrade your skills in the art of relationship. Have you taken any workshops or read any books that have helped you become a better lover and collaborator? Have you meditated on cracking open the secrets of inspired and inspiring sharing? Even if you haven't done much, there's still time to accomplish miracles. Through the end of December, you'll continue to attract cosmic luck whenever you break any bad old habits that have hurt your ability to give and get the best from your intimate alliances.

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2007, Cancerian. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the long-term tasks you were assigned six months ago.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2007. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the long-term tasks you were assigned six months ago. I hope you've been capitalizing on the fact that this is the Year of Well-Earned Luck in Higher Love. It has been over a decade since your romantic evolution has been as ripe for rapid progress as it is now. Remember, for best results, keep your priorities screwed on straight: Always focus more intensely on the pleasure of giving the beautiful love you have to offer than on your hunger for the love you have always wanted to get.

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2007, Virgo. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the long-term tasks you were assigned six months ago. I hope that by now you're at least midway through a transformation of your relationship to family. That might mean you're leading a revolution to reinvent your family of origin. It might mean you're making decisions about how to shape the family of your future. It could involve you working hard to ensure that you have a close-knit group of people, not necessarily related to you biologically, to serve as a reliable source of emotional sustenance. Or all of the above.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2007, Libra. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the long-term tasks you were assigned six months ago. So let me ask you: Have you been practicing discernment as you've explored the mysteries of variety? Have you been trying a host of different alternatives, but without dissipating your focus? The danger is the opportunity; the opportunity is the danger: In the next six months, you'll either refine your intelligence or waste your intelligence as you experiment with combining things that have never before been combined. You'll either embody the archetype of the promiscuous dilettante or the archetype of the versatile master of improvisation.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2007. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the long-term tasks you were assigned six months ago. I trust that by now you're supremely composed as the changes whirl around you and within you. I mean, you will always be the zodiac's master of transformation; you'll always thrive on going through ceaseless, deep-seated shifts that would terrify most of the other signs. But if you're taking advantage of this year's cosmic opportunities, Scorpio, your eruptions of abracadabra! are being buffered by a profound grace. Your experiments in turning lead into gold and garbage into treasure are proceeding with a generous-spirited poise. Now you're ready to take it to the next level of relaxed elegance.

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2007, Sagittarius. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the long-term tasks you were assigned six months ago. I hope that by now you are cashing in on the fact that this is the Year of the Supercharged Libido and the Spiritual Orgasm. Not only do you have extraordinary reserves of physical energy available; you also have access to what amounts to a kind of metaphysical lust, whose primal power can enable you to smash long-standing mental blocks and break on through to the other side of anything you want to break on through to the other side of.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Welcome to Part Two of your outlook for the second half of 2007. We're checking up on how you're progressing with the long-term tasks you were assigned six months ago. By now you've probably figured out that it's the Year of Secrets. Truths that have long been hidden from you are emerging, and if you keep on probing, the rest will spill out between now and December. Certain feelings you have been concealing from yourself are also bubbling up into your awareness. Fuzzy understandings that have previously hindered your ability to see the big picture are finally coming into focus as well. Don't fear or resist these developments, Capricorn. They will free up a lot of blocked energy.

I hope by now you realize that this is your Year of Getting Your Career in Gear. It may or may not be a time when you'll climb to the top of the heap and score fresh privileges and new clout. But it's definitely a time when you can move closer to making a living from doing what you love.

Have you cultivated your skill at reading people's energy and understanding what motivates them? I hope so, because 2007 should be the year you generate big benefits for yourself by bringing out the best in your allies and cohorts.

So let me ask you, Gemini: Are you working hard to heal the indecisiveness that has dissipated your energy in the past? I hope so.

How well are you capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities, Cancerian? Now that we're almost halfway through 2007, let's take an inventory. I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and make the following declaration: "I can't believe I'm saying this, but this year I realized in many colorful ways that limitations are my friends. The obstructions I faced eventually forced me to become far more resourceful than I'd ever been before. The wastefulness I uncovered showed me how important it is to shed my trivial wishes and focus intensely on my top priority desires. The confusions I encountered taught me valuable secrets about how to master my emotions and dissolve my superstitious fears."

I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and say the following: "This was the year I learned how to play and have fun on a higher level. I resurrected everything I knew about playing and having fun as a child, and applied it to my life as an adult. I liberated my imagination in the bedroom and in the workplace; I gave myself permission to seek out amusement and delight as if they were the holiest motivations of all. I cavorted and joked and fooled around as if my dreams depended on it."

I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and say the following: "This was the year I came all the way home. It was a turning point when I learned to speak with my own voice instead of trying to speak with the voices of everyone who's ever been important to me. In 2007 I found my power spot, my mother lode, my sacred ground. For the first time, I have a deeply felt certainty that I belong here on this planet; I belong here in my life; I belong here in this community and this mission and this body."

Libra (September 23-October 22)

We're almost halfway through 2007. Let's take inventory of how well you're capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities. I hope you've realized by now that although you've always been a pretty good communicator, there's room for you to become even better. For instance, you can learn to be much better at saying what you really mean instead of what you think people want to hear, yet without sacrificing your natural tact. You can also become more adept at staying true to yourself while still being sensitive to other people; you can increasingly find that you don't have to lose touch with what you really feel as you empathetically tune in to what everyone else feels.

Now that we're almost halfway through 2007, it's time to assess how well you're capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities. So let me ask you a few questions. Have you been working hard to increase your value? I don't just mean economically, although it's true that this is the best time in over a decade for you to make more money and launch long-term plans for financial growth. But I hope that you're also adding to your worth in every way you can imagine, like by getting the training and new skills that will make you irresistible to future employers, lovers, and collaborators; and by purifying your motivations and clarifying your ethics and bolstering your integrity.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Now that we're almost halfway through 2007, it's time to assess how well you're capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities. So let me ask you a few pointed questions. Have you been reinventing yourself from the ground up at least once a week? Have you been shedding old shticks and learning new tricks? How relentlessly have you committed yourself to the arts of liberation? There's still a lot of time to become even more receptive and responsive to the steady stream of wake-up calls that life is sending your way. For the next six months, you'll have cosmic luck on your side whenever you actively court the fertile blessings of future shock.

We're almost halfway through 2007. Let's take inventory of how well you're capitalizing on this year's unique opportunities. Are you exorcising the ghosts that have messed with you for so long? Have you been wrapping up all unfinished business and resolving every ambiguous pain-in-the-ass that has sapped your energy? I hope so. By your next birthday, I'm rooting for you to finally graduate from the lessons you've been studying for years. Then you'll be primed and receptive for the fresh teachings that will begin flowing your way in 2008.

I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and say something like the following: "I'm pleased that this year I've met many new people and expanded my network and reached a bigger audience. I'm ecstatic that I have deepened my connections with pragmatic idealists who share my core values. And I'm proud that I have honed my message and product so well that I'm having a more profound influence than ever before."

I'm hoping that six months from now, you'll look back and say something like the following: "To my astonishment, this was the year I beat 70 percent of my fear of success and dissolved 80 percent of my tendency to sabotage my ambitions. Not only that. To my great satisfaction, I shed 70 percent of my martyr complex, lost 75 percent of my fascination for glamorous suffering, and smashed 85 percent of my perverse attraction to the victim archetype. This was one of the Best. Years. Ever."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Don't take your time, Aries. Move double fast and strategize from many angles, always thinking ten steps ahead. Please don't keep your hands clean, either. Play with the muck and roll in the mud and learn from the dirt. And don't you dare be measured and balanced. Instead, be an intense and relentless initiator of decisive actions. One last thing: Don't play nice and sweet. Be a holy troublemaker, a noisemaker who breaks the silence and keeps it broken.



Got enough clues to chew on for a while? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead. 

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Surreal hope" means having faith in a future opportunity that at first appears in an out-of-context situation. Say, for example, that you have an unsettling initial exposure to a stranger whom you will eventually realize is an important ally. Maybe when you see this person for the first time, he or she is looking dazed and disheveled on a street corner with tear stains on the cheek, having just broken up with a lover. And maybe you feel a strange attraction to this weirdo despite his or her unflattering appearance. Having surreal hope, in this instance, would mean that you'd refrain from being dismissive and judgmental, but would instead entertain the possibility that your fascination might portend an interesting link under more favorable circumstances at a later date.


What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny? For more hints, listen to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead. 

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Though one of the closest stars to our sun, Teegarden's star was unknown to astronomers until 2003. Located in the constellation of Aries, it's a red dwarf with relatively modest heat and luminosity, and moves very fast compared to other stars. Let's make Teegarden's star your metaphor of the month for June. I predict that you'll discover and engage with a major presence that has always been close to you but low-key--a quick, understated influence that has never before captivated your attention.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Chameleons use their stupendously strong tongues to reach out and capture their prey, which can be up to one-sixth their size. The equivalent for you would be if you could snag a big chicken with the muscular organ in your mouth. I'm not predicting you'll develop that skill in the coming days. But I do believe you'll have a powerful tongue in the sense that the words you shape with it will have a prodigious capacity to change your surroundings and influence everyone around you.

"The Only Three Questions That Count" is the title of a book by Ken Fisher. I'm stealing it to use as the theme of your horoscope. So your next assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to craft three essential questions that will guide your journey between now and the end of 2007. These queries should excite your natural curiosity about the life issues that matter most to you. They should be carefully and precisely formulated. And they should motivate you to keep your mind wide open and hungry as you hunt for more insight into your most bafflingly interesting mysteries.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm a big fan of facing your problems head-on and dealing forthrightly with your pain. But what if that approach isn't always best? Renowned psychologist Richard Lazarus said he wanted to "challenge the view that psychological health demands full realism." He believed that some sick people get healthy faster by refusing to admit how serious their problems are. To those in stressful situations, he recommended that they could reduce their anxiety by describing their predicament in a matter-of-fact way. "Avoiding what is painful, to a great extent, seems to serve a positive function," he concluded. Although I'm not sure this strategy is universally applicable, I do recommend it for you right now, Aries.



Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead. 

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To manufacture one penny, the U.S. Treasury spends 1.4 cents. To process petroleum for use in operating a car, the oil industry expends 20 percent more energy than the gasoline yields. These are the kinds of situations you've urgently got to avoid in the coming week, Aries. You need to get substantially more out of any project than what you put into it. So choose your fuel wisely. Be resourceful in your push for greater efficiency.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"If you hold your dreams too tightly, you'll crush their little ribs," was the message scrawled on the wall of a public restroom I visited today. I immediately recognized that as excellent advice for you. While I'm usually all in favor of cultivating a ferocious devotion towards one's goals and desires, I've noticed lately that your grasp on yours has turned into a manic clench. Please let them breathe better. Give them some slack. Maybe tell yourself a joke about how funny you look applying that death-grip.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"I was the wife of Vlajko Stojiljkovic, deceased, who was indicted at the Hague War Crimes Tribunal. First, I assure you that the indictment was politically motivated and utterly without merit. Secondly, I need to transfer our vast fortune out of the country. The funds are in excess of 64 million U.S. dollars. Can you help? Are you trustworthy? I can offer you 30 percent. Please forward your contact info to me a.s.a.p. I am grateful. -Glorja." Dear Aries, there's a good chance you'll soon get a money-related offer that's as bogus as the above communiqu√©. DO NOT TAKE IT! Much more reliable financial opportunities are on their way.

"'Don¬ít look before you leap!' is a Zen saying that contrasts with what many in the West consider wise counsel," writes Christopher Moors in his article "Magical Buddha Nature" at tinyurl.com/34swxd. "If everything is premeditated, we never have the naked brilliance of a truly new experience. Though we might be able to temper fear in this way, we live at the minimum and have no room for the divine to enter our hearts. Love is above all things the freedom of expansion." I'm passing on this advice, Aries, just in time for the most unboxed, unexpected, unprecedented phase of your astrological cycle. Rely on spontaneity to teach you all you need to know.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

On April 1, 1976, British astronomer Patrick Moore told his radio listeners that a rare configuration of Jupiter and Pluto was occurring. So dramatically would it affect Earth's gravity, he said, that they might feel lighter than usual, and perhaps even be able to float up into the air. I'm wondering if we can expect a similar phenomena this week. There's a rare grand trine in fire signs, with Jupiter in Sagittarius, Saturn in Leo, and the sun in Aries. Especially for you, the buoyancy factor will be in full play, and levels of levity will be at a maximum. If you can't actually fly, you'll probably get higher than you've been in a long time.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge if you tune in to your EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPE for the week ahead.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

 You will soon uncover evidence that a seemingly innocuous hot dog vendor is actually creating an army of cyborgs in the sewer system under the streets. You will also make a citizen's arrest of a grandmother who's embezzling money from a children's charity to support her gambling habit. And in the most shocking development of all, you'll develop the psychic power to exorcise evil spirits that are threatening to demonically possess the Internet. APRIL FOOL! Your imminent future will be interesting, but not that interesting. More importantly, it will be interesting in distinctly non-pathological, unhysterical ways. Your adventures will revolve around healing, fun, and education, not trouble, danger, and chaos.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Hundreds of years ago, the Native American tribe known as the Seneca had a rule of thumb about when to sow corn seed. You had to wait until the weather was warm enough to lie naked in the dirt without discomfort. I believe a similar principle applies to your plans to start a certain new enterprise, Aries. Hold off on the launch until you're able to take off all your clothes in a natural setting and stretch out on the ground without shivering.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Here you come dragging your exhausted but redeemed ass out of the deep dark forest of symbols. The red-eyed monkey demons fall off your back as you straggle toward the light. Your sunken eyes see wonders they were blind to before your ordeal. Your heart rages with a wild angelic love you've never tapped into before. And as you realize the magnitude of your tough miracle, you feel glimmers of gratitude for the rude tests you had to endure. Maybe you should get totally lost in limbo more often.

"Dear Rob: As an experiment, I've been trying to soften myself--to see what it's like to stand in a room and not always take the lead, not assume that no one else knows what they're doing except me. It's had an interesting effect so far: People seem more eager to play nice and offer me their good energy. But I don't know if I'm willing to give up my take-charge instincts for much longer. Do I have to resign myself to either being strong or being loved? -Assertive Aries." Dear Assertive: Could you add a little more love to your take-charge ferocity? And be more softly aggressive? And be open-hearted in your assertiveness?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You're facing a classic Aries dilemma: You can either run away from demanding responsibilities towards an illusory freedom that might allow you to cling to a false sense of pride . . . or else you can gleefully embrace interesting responsibilities that will build your self-confidence as you fight for a whole new kind of freedom. The outcome of this choice is uncertain, and won't be determined by invisible vibrations beaming down on you from the planets. Everything depends on whether you'll make use of your dormant reserves of willpower.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Have no fear of the damp and the dark and the cramped. In a place fitting that description, you can track down clues to a mystery that will inflame your curiosity and educate your soul; you can tap into a fresh surge of courage that'll render at least some of your suffering irrelevant. Expect a miracle to appear in the shadows, Aries. It could resemble a cornucopia spilling over with diamonds and potatoes, or maybe a charred fireman's helmet bedecked with sexual roses and fresh $20 bills.

"Dear Rob: Could you please tell me how I can get the men I like to remove me from the pedestals they put me on? If something doesn't change soon, I'll have to call down the lightning and obliterate their delusions. Sorry if that sounds violent. It's just that storms start building whenever I feel cramped by demands disguised as love. -Over-Idolized Aries." Dear Over-Idolized: Good news! You've entered a phase that will be favorable for shattering naive projections and unrealistic expectations. You'll also be skilled at escaping neediness that feels like a straitjacket.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Happy Valentine Daze, Aries! On this lover's holiday, let's see what we can do to purge some of your old romantic karma. With a cleaner slate, you'll be freer to create the kind of love you really want in the future. To begin, write a list of the worst sins you've committed against your ex-intimates. Include behavior that was ignorant, cruel, or unconscious. Next, think of atonements you might make for the hurtful things you did. For instance, you could send your ex an "I'm sorry for the craziness our relationship caused you" letter. Finally, Aries, forgive yourself of your errors.

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love how skilled you are at wriggling free of unproductive jams. I admire the way you change yourself into a fresh creation when you've gone as far as you can with the old model. I am delighted by how robustly you rebel against your past and fling yourself open to the unpredictable sweep of the future. There are so many other ways I adore you, my dear Aries, and here's one more: I am enchanted by how you always seem ready to build a castle in the wilderness if this world ever fails you.

P.S. Memorize the following lines, and say them to a soul friend who most appreciates extravagant expressions of affection: "I love you more than it's possible to love anyone. I love you more than love itself. I love you more than you love yourself. I love you more than God loves you. I love you more than anyone has ever loved anyone in the history of the universe. In fact, I love you *more* than I love you." (P.S. But don't, Aries, under any circumstances, say this: "I love you more than you love me.")


The preceding love notes were brought to you by my last two books, PRONOIA Is the Antidote for Paranoia: How the Whole World Is Conspiring to Shower You with Blessings and The Televisionary Oracle, and by my music CD, Give Too Much.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Happy Valentine Daze, Taurus! During this lover's holiday, I encourage you to devote yourself full-time to acting like a person who's in love. Even if you're not currently in the throes of passion for a special someone, pretend you are. Everywhere you go, exude that charismatic blend of shell-shocked contentment and blissful turmoil that comes over you when you're infatuated. Let everyone you meet soak up the delicious wisdom you exude. Dispense free blessings and extra slack like a rich saint high on natural endorphins. (I assure you that this assignment is in perfect accord with the astrological omens.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I have one little whisper of warning and one big blast of encouragement for you. First, the warning: Don't be like the ancient Roman emperor Caligula, who declared war on Neptune, god of the sea, and commanded his troops to hurl their spears into the water. Now here's the encouragement: If you heed my warning, the coming weeks will be an excellent time to go to war, metaphorically speaking. There's a 95 percent chance that your cause will be just, a 90 percent chance that you'll be able to enlist a solid fighting force, and an 85 percent chance that you'll acquit yourself with resourceful courage.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In recent years, groups of students at Yale and other Ivy League universities have pioneered a unique cultural trend: naked parties. Those in attendance at one of these invitation-only affairs agree to spend the evening in their birthday suits. "The dynamic is completely different from a clothed party," reports Yale coed Megan Crandell, quoted in The Scotsman. "People are so conscious of how they're coming across that conversations end up being more sophisticated." Your assignment, Aries--should you choose to accept it--is to bring the phenomenon of the naked party to your own locale. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you're meant to be a social catalyst who inspires people to strip away their defenses and practice the art of radical authenticity.

"When are your cats old enough to learn about Jesus?" asks The Onion, America's finest newspaper. Think about that question for a while, Aries. Then, once you've worked yourself up into a riddle-solving frame of mind, move on to these other, more pressing brain-teasers: When will you finally be old enough to figure out what you want to do when you grow up? When will it be the right time to reveal your secret super-powers to the world? How long are you going to wait before you get around to being completely committed to what you were born to do?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Let's get a few things straight, Aries. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Facts are in the eye of the beholder. Logic is the opiate of those who are afraid of their feelings. Sorry if that sounds anti-intellectual. I'm exaggerating slightly in hopes of encouraging the free flow of your naked intuition in 2007. I want to prod you into cultivating so much emotional intelligence that you'll be able to out-argue your cynically reasonable friends. I want to help you rip off the locks on your doors of perception so you can see the magic that's just below the surface everywhere you look.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"The creative person is both more primitive and more cultivated, more destructive and more constructive, a lot madder and a lot saner, than the average person." So said Dr. Frank Barron, a pioneer in the psychology of creativity. I believe that describes you pretty well right now, Taurus--even if you don't usually think of yourself as creative or artistic. The astrological omens suggest that you've got more lust for life than any other sign of the zodiac; you're in an intimate alignment with the throbbing hum of the Divine Wow. Please remember how important it is to be discerning about where you direct that much energy! Don't waste it on trivial pleasures or goals that are unworthy of you. You now have the power to change things you thought you could never change in a thousand years.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Of your many selves, the one I'm most entertained by right now is the experimentalist who wants to mix ingredients that have never before been together. Another self I really like is the frontier-dweller who's conspiring to fast-forward you into a rowdy rebirth. There's a third self--the cagey mediator--who I'm hoping will get those other two to work together intimately. If that happy collaboration occurs, the whole motley crew will live stickily ever after, or at least until May, when a mid-course correction might be necessary.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

If you're not rejected or refused at least once in early 2007, you're probably not trying hard enough. Life is dying to teach you a thing or two about not giving up no matter what. The gods of success won't hand you your purple heart, let alone your intelligence upgrade, until you prove that you can fight ferociously for your dreams even when you're a bit puzzled. Here's a formula that will serve you well during your heroic (but amusing!) ordeal: Find a way to coordinate your spiritual longing with your creative rage. Here's another tip: Learn to identify and capitalize on the fertile chaos that's all mixed up with the plain old ordinary chaos.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

One of the regulations listed in the book Rules of Golf states that if a player's ball comes to rest near a live rattlesnake, the player may move the ball without penalty. This is a good metaphor for you to keep in mind as you play the game of life this week. According to my interpretation of the omens, your progress toward your next goal may bring a close brush with the equivalent of a noxious serpent. My advice is to not summon any false bravado, and not to go into denial about the risk involved. Before continuing play, move your ball well away from the hazard--preferably with the help of a ten-foot pole or your best spiritual ally.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Normally there are about 9,300 people on the planet who could be your very best friend, even your soul mate. But in 2007, I believe that figure will rise dramatically--possibly as high as 16,000. This hot tip from me to you should clue you in to the fact that the universe will be exceptionally sympathetic to your interests in the coming months; it should motivate you to ask aggressively for what you really want, as opposed to whining and pining for what you sort of want.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Is there anything fake going on in your home? Have any delusions been allowed to thrive? Is anyone pretending to feel or be something they're not, even if it's in a seemingly good cause? If so, Libra, head in the direction of radical authenticity. Gamble on the hypothesis that uncovering the naked truth will ultimately promote domestic bliss. Scared to try that? Remember this: Love trumps fear every time.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In the past, love has on occasion had certain resemblances to a wounded three-legged wild boar from a swampy junkyard in hell. But if I'm interpreting the coming attractions correctly, love in 2007 could be more like a white dove balancing on the head of a black horse as it gallops along a beach under a full moon in summer. Does the phrase "higher love" mean anything to you, Scorpio? It's there for the plucking, if you've got the right attitude. And what's the right attitude? For starters, it means that you vow to cultivate a fierce determination to see--and keep seeing--the best in people. Secondly, it means that you deepen your understanding of the fact that you can't prosper at the expense of others. Thirdly, it means you become intensely aware that one of the best ways to nurture your mental hygiene is to enhance the well-being of the people you care about.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Cosmic forces, being primarily spiritual in nature, rarely coalesce in such a way as to actually encourage you to shop till you drop. However, this is one of those inside-out moments in eternity when tapping in to your buyological urges can become an acute meditation on the meaning of your life. Here are a few questions to guide your quest. How do your possessions control you? How do they inspire you? Do the objects you seek to own usually encourage you to be more adventurous in seeking fresh experiences, or do they tend to serve as substitutes for seeking fresh experiences? How does the way you spend money reflect your ideas about what life owes you and what you owe life?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

A Capricorn reader recently accused me of being too upbeat and utopian. He said that your tribe needs "more gristle and bone and sinew." He suggested that I travel to the Sudan or Iraq, and expose my tender perspective to scenes of blood and fire. In lieu of carrying out that proposal (which was impossible given my limited funds and time), I instead watched three war movies before composing your horoscope. Here it is: I dare you to give your highest hopes and most idealistic dreams a trial by fire that raises those hopes and dreams to a higher octave.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

No other place in America has a worse reputation than the state of New Jersey. It's called "the armpit of the nation" by some people, and is said to lead the world in strip malls per capita and terrible pollution smells. But my experience of the place has been different. I once lived in New Jersey for six years. It was a happy time. There were mountains in the north, beaches in the east, the mysterious Pine Barrens in the middle, and people I loved and enjoyed everywhere. Your challenge in the coming week is similar to mine, Aquarius: Find beauty and meaning while dwelling amidst circumstances that conventional wisdom and peer pressure might brand as boring or repellant.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Your world is teeming with talented people who are seething with frustrated intelligence. Everyone's antsy for a rescue they can't even imagine, let alone articulate. All of the half-baked solutions that are being proposed would lead only to more frustrated intelligence. That's where you come in, Pisces. You have the potential, though you may not have been fully aware of it until now, to be an understated leader who leads your tribe out of the foggy morass. Especially if you increase your self-discipline, you can conjure up the magic that will catalyze an upgrade for everyone involved.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The coming year will be a favorable time for you to prostrate yourself in prayer on mountaintops, to grunt ferocious promises into the night wind while standing on rooftops, to dance yourself into an ecstatic state and then meditate on your life's bottomless questions, and to make love with funky spiritual grace while flying on a plane. Catch my drift, Aries? Doing anything that combines heights and depths will put you in alignment with cosmic rhythms.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

It's possible you'll live for 150 years. Scientific studies on how to outwit the aging process are generating increasingly compelling data, and so is psychospiritual research into the attitudes and emotions that encourage longevity. The coming year will be prime time for you to make yourself aware of these explorations, and to adjust your lifestyle accordingly. Here are two places to start your investigation: (1) the article "I'm Going to Live Forever;" (2) the book Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever, by Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
Jargon Watch author Gareth Branwyn defines "obstacle illusion" as "something that looks like it will be a huge problem, but turns out not to be." This is your theme for early 2007, Gemini. You may imagine you'll have to face a lot of resistance to your dreams, when in fact you won't. You might even gear up for confrontations that don't actually need to take place. Ironically, though, the willpower and tenacity you summon while expecting to face difficulties could prove valuable. So maybe it's fine if at first you don't realize that the obstacles are illusions.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I predict that you won't punch out Paris Hilton in a bar in 2007. Nor will you buy your own Lear jet, train to be a Shaolin Kung Fu monk, or get a clip-on nose ring. Leather chaps? I bet you won't wear them even once, nor will you sneak into your old high school at night and spray-paint obscenities on the walls. In the coming year, you might, on the other hand, get a tattoo of the glyph for infinity. You may obtain a ceremonial sword and use it in a ritual to symbolically cut away a certain dead-end fantasy you've been clinging to even though it's no damn good for you. You could also go on a quest to satisfy your oldest curiosity, and learn a lot about how to control your emotions without repressing them.



This week and next week, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 2 and Part 3 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2007. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Year-End Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Leo (July 23-August 22)

From a metaphorical perspective, Leo, the 2006 chapter of your life story could have been titled "Asleep in the Garden." Beautiful fertility and fertile beauty have surrounded you, but you've been more aware of them in your dreams and subconscious mind than in your conscious waking life. I expect that to change in 2007. That's why I'm envisioning a new chapter that'll be called "Awake in the Garden."



This week and next week, my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES will feature Part 2 and Part 3 of my long-range, in-depth explorations of your destiny in 2007. Tune in! Start brainstorming about the adventures that could be in store for you in the coming months. (P.S. Part 1 of your Year-End Predictions, which I offered last week, is also still available.)

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Patriarch Bartholomew, the leader of the Orthodox Christian Church, has a flock of 300 million. Unlike most other religious leaders, he crusades for the preservation of the environment. "To commit a crime against the natural world is a sin," he says. "For humans to cause species to become extinct and to destroy the biological diversity of God's creation; for humans to contaminate the Earth's waters, land, air, and life with poisonous substances: These are sins." The astrological omens suggest that he'll be a good role model for you in 2007, Virgo. You'll generate lush personal dividends if you intensify your intention to live in harmony with nature and invoke a spiritual zeal as you defend your planet against its despoilers.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I predict that sometime in the coming year two rich attorneys will offer you $20,000 if you'll deliver a cursed diamond to their shaman in Brazil for exorcism. But you will demand that they not only give you the money, but also introduce you to their good friend Angelina Jolie. They'll balk at that, and the deal will fall through. But then you'll write a movie script based on your fantasy of the experience you might have had if you had actually done the deal, and you'll sell the script to a producer who gets Angelina Jolie to be one of the stars. And if that exact scenario doesn't happen as prophesied, Libra, I bet you'll have a comparable adventure or two that will revolve around the power of your imagination, your determination to hold out for exactly what you want, and a rich harvest of poetic justice.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

On the first Monday of every month, a vision of the Virgin Mary appears on the back porch of Audrey Hoff's house in Miami. Even if you usually have no interest in curiosities like this, Scorpio, I predict that in 2007 you'll be involved in a comparable phenomenon. It won't necessarily feature the Virgin Mary, but will be in alignment with your particular belief system. So if you're a Buddhist, you may have dreams of the Buddha visiting your bedroom. If you're a gay Republican, you might have vivid waking visions of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan making holy love in a log cabin. If you're a lapsed Catholic, you may have recurring dreams of Jesus giving you permission not to pray to him. If you're an atheist, you could have a series of spectacular epiphanies that prove to you with ever-more certainty that there is no God.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

If 2006 sometimes felt like the Year of Perpetual PMS (even for you men), 2007 will quickly make you forget any bloated, edgy feelings that may still linger. The coming months may in fact feel like the Year of Perpetual Ovulation (even for you men). I bet you'll often feel horny not just for sexual adventures, but for other kinds of intimate exchanges that make you smarter and wilder.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Your power animal in 2007 will be the hare, whose front legs are shorter than its back legs, allowing it to run uphill with exceptional speed. What this means, Capricorn, is that while you will have more ascents to make than usual in the coming months, you will also be well-equipped to carry them out with efficiency and power. The steep challenges you face might feel daunting to anyone else, but your heightened ability to conquer them will often inspire you to approach them with relish.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Some people imagine that the Aquarian Age, if it ever kicks in, will be an airy-fairy affair, rife with crystal healings and dolphin channeling. We'll be surrounded by neo-hippie do-gooders who spread sentimental love. But that's all wrong. The real Aquarian Age will bring a revolution in our political and economic structures, fueled by the Internet and other technologies. There'll be intelligent machines with whom we'll develop complex relationships. Sexual identities will mutate and expand, leading to at least seven distinct genders, and there'll be a host of new ways to experience erotic pleasure. Advances in anti-aging research, nanotechnology, and genetic manipulation will mutate many ideas about what it means to be human. You are by no means obligated to be on the front lines of this revolution, Aquarius. But if you do feel inclined to hang out there, 2007 will be the most adventurous year of your life so far.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"Picture the Grand Canyon," says Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield. "Every hundred years, a child comes by and throws a mustard seed into it. In the time it takes to fill the hole in the earth with mustard seeds, one mahakalpa will have passed. To perfect the virtuous heart--the joy of integrity--takes a thousand mahakalpas." If that's true, Pisces, then you've still got a lot of work to do. However, the planets are aligned in such a way as to suggest you could make unusually great progress toward the goal of perfecting the virtuous heart in 2007. For best results, meditate often on the phrase "the joy of integrity." Get very familiar with the pleasurable emotion that comes from acting with impeccability. And try out this idea from Gandhi: Integrity is the royal road to your inner freedom.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"When the first settlers arrived in the New World, they were terrified by the vast open spaces," says Peter Anastas in the film Polis Is This. "They wanted to remake this unkempt paradise into a big English garden." This is a scenario you should NOT imitate in 2007, Aries. Wander out into the unknown with a cracked grin and a wild heart. Let it work its elemental magic on you. Don't be too eager to turn the frontier into a comfy hang-out.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Though millions of other people may be flirting with glamorous badness and crafty nastiness in 2007, I bet you'll have a minimal attraction to negativity, no matter how interesting it might allegedly be. Drama kings and drama queens may try to seduce you into the crazy chaos they stir up through their addiction to pain, but you'll be pretty immune to their temptations. Seemingly reasonable people might hope you'll buy into their gloom and doom, but you'll be too smart for that. Congratulations in advance for your determination to be free of the stupid suffering that so many people love to entertain themselves with.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"Dear Rob: Did you ever hear of that monstrous experiment in which a monkey actually died from lack of touch? I often feel like that poor creature. For a while I thought I was being selfish to want more love, but now I'm sick of that idiotic intellectualized self-denial, and refuse to pretend I'm a self-sufficient saint who can go through life feeling a chronic grey bathwater haze of half-assed passion. Is there any hope? -Deprived Gemini." Dear Deprived: Good news! The possibility that you'll be inundated with love is higher in 2007 than it has been for years. Here are two tips to make it more likely that you'll be in the right places at the right times to capitalize: (1) Make yourself supremely lovable; (2) increase your capacity to give love.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I nominate you to be the zodiac's most successful complainer in 2007. According to my analysis of the omens, you could excel at formulating brisk critiques and constructive dissent. You may even have a genius for bringing the bracing intelligence of the heart to bear on situations that are paralyzed by mind games. If you manage to fulfill the potential I'm prophesying, you'll set in motion far-reaching ripples of benevolent change. More power to you, Cancerian! May your grumbles and squawks and protests be imbued with lyrical persuasiveness.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

My beautiful and talented Leo friend Alisha had a traumatic experience early in her romantic history. At age 17, she fell in love with the garbage man who hauled away her family's trash every Saturday. Through her persistent efforts, the two of them started dating, even though her parents hated his surly vulgarity, his permanently dirty fingernails, and the fact that he couldn't read. After a whirlwind affair, alas, he broke up with her. Ever since, even as Alisha has learned to make better choices, she has carried the tragicomic embarrassment of having been dumped by a mean, illiterate garbage man. But I predict that in 2007 she'll be healed: Delightful adventures in love will utterly expunge that old twinge. Moreover, I believe many of you Leos will find comparable romantic redemption.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In Kabbalah, the tree of life is the primary symbol of the universe. In Norse mythology, the World Tree links heaven to earth and shelters all living things; beneath it lies a magical well with water that confers special powers on those who drink it. The ancient Chinese spoke of a peach tree that bore a single fruit once every three millennia, and provided immortality to anyone who ate it. In the mythic tradition of modern science, trees have a crucial role in maintaining the ecological health of the planet. I mention all this, Virgo, because in 2007 you'll benefit tremendously from deepening your relationship with trees--both the actual and mythical kinds. Get to know them better. Learn from them. Plant some. Put a picture of a favorite tree on your altar. Hug one now and then.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

According to The Onion newspaper, the Catholic Church has abolished the traditional "blessed" status of the meek. The new official story is that the meek shall not inherit the earth. One Church official was quoted as saying, "Everything about the meek, from their quiet demeanors to their utter lack of can-do spirit, goes against Church philosophy." I can't confirm the accuracy of The Onion's report, but it does underscore a point I want to drive home to you in 2007: It'll be a favorable time for you to get tough with the docile, submissive aspects of your own psyche. Humility's fine; that can stay. But you should take aggressive measures to lose any tendencies you might have to be passive. Capitalize on the fact that events in the coming months will help you tap into reserves of courage that have previously been inaccessible.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In 2007, you'll need to find the power to do the half-right thing when it's impossible to do the totally right thing. To help you do that, remember this advice from Abraham Lincoln: "The true rule, in determining to embrace or reject anything, is not whether it have any evil in it; but whether it have more of evil than of good. There are few things wholly evil, or wholly good. Almost every thing is an inseparable compound of the two; so that our best judgment of the preponderance between them is continually demanded."

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Not everything you feel in 2007 will be new, but you'll have a lot more novel emotions than in a typical year.  Not everything you do will be creative and imaginative, but I suspect you'll often be improvising your way smartly through experiences that have no precedent. You may not be relentlessly reinventing yourself, but I bet you'll be imitating your old shticks and tricks less than you ever have before.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Your sins are pretty mild, Capricorn. Still, you have from time to time violated some of your own highest standards; you have on occasion failed to live with impeccable ethical integrity. That's the bad news. The good news is that in 2007 you will have the best chance ever to atone for past mistakes. If done well, your corrective actions will win you a permanent vacation from the hell that those mistakes have sometimes trapped you in.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

There are still places in China where plagues of locusts periodically descend in Biblical proportions. A few years ago, farmers in the region of Xinjiang fought back, gathering an army of 10,000 chickens in anticipation of the invading hordes. The bird soldiers were trained for two months, and when the showdown came, they acquitted themselves admirably. This vignette is an apt metaphor for a challenge you'll face in 2007. While in general the year should bring an abundant amount of sweet luck and high adventures, there will be a locust visitation or two. I urge you to assemble your own personal equivalent of a chicken army. What might that mean, practically speaking? Here are some possibilities: (1) Be well-prepared for natural anomalies. (2) Ally yourself with the enemy of your adversary. (3) Get others to help you fight your battles.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You're not wearing a chastity belt right now, right? You don't have on shoes that are so tight that they constrict your sense of adventure? And please tell me you're not lugging around toxic beliefs about the impossibility of experiencing authentic joy in this "sick, twisted, miserable world we live in." But if by chance you have victimized yourself with any of the debilitations I just named--or any other form of self-torture for the matter--please take this opportunity to unburden yourself. The time has come for you to explore the mysteries of pleasure, happiness, and outright euphoria. I hope that in 2007, you will fully exploit the new title I now anoint you with: Bliss Warrior.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Happy Holy Daze, Aries! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gifts for you. What might inspire you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2007? Here's my answer: a plane ticket to an exotic playground where your mind will get blown and your emotions aired out and your instincts educated. Another gift I'd love you to have would be a pilgrimage to a spot where you lived once upon a time. There you could take advantage of Nelson Mandela's counsel: "There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered."



This week my  EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES offer you a preview of the major themes you'll be working and playing with in 2007. Beginning December 26, I'll begin a three-part, three-week series in which I'll talk in-depth about your long-range forecast in the EXPANDED AUDIO HOROSCOPES. Tune in!


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Listen! I will be honest with you. I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes." Walt Whitman wrote that in his poem "Song of the Open Road," and now I'm saying it to you. If you expect the events of 2007 to bring you old smooth prizes, you'll be disappointed. But if you can figure out how to change your attitude in such a way as to actually yearn for rough new prizes, you will be rewarded beyond anything you can imagine. The first hint of how true this is will arrive soon.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In the ancient Hebrew text known as the Second Book of Enoch, the author describes his trip through the ten heavens and a meeting with God. He's surprised to find that hell is here, located in the northern regions of the third heaven. Why is this relevant to you? Because I believe it might help you understand an apparent anomaly that will soon appear. While you'll be having expansive adventures in circumstances that resemble paradise, there'll also be a diabolical area nestled right in the midst of the beauty. It won't be a big deal or terrible annoyance as long as you recognize it early and plot a course around it.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom," wrote Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard. That's vividly true for you right now, Aries. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you'll thrive on the whirling gaga that overwhelms you as you play in vast, open spaces. Your best decisions will arise as your mind is boggled and wobbled by liberating dramas. So let's celebrate the disorientation you're feeling, and do everything we can to make sure that more is on its way.

I think this would be a good standard for all of us to live up to: to molt our personas, or social masks, at least once a year. It's that time for you, Aries.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I suspect you'll be a genius of awkwardness in the coming week, Aries. What that means is that you'll have a knack for doing the half-right thing at the half-right time--and yet that's exactly what'll be necessary in order to bring about unexpected outcomes that are in everyone's best interests. In the short run you may make a perfect mess, but I bet that will ultimately add more beauty and intrigue to the big picture.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
Recently uncovered evidence seems to confirm the argument that Christopher Columbus was a cruel, stupid tyrant who paved the way for the genocide of Native Americans. But that's not the part of his story I want to bring to your attention right now, Aries. Rather, I'd like you to meditate on the wisdom of the bumper sticker I just saw: "Columbus did not know where he was going. When he got back, he didn't know where he had been. But he had a great adventure. And he did it all on borrowed money. There's hope for all of us." Given your current astrological omens, there's substantial hope for you to pull off a feat comparable to the one the bumper sticker describes.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When George W. Bush replaced Bill Clinton as U.S. president, Bush's advisor Karl Rove decided to take extraordinary measures in cleansing the White House of the previous occupants' energy. Rove was especially obsessed with banishing the "evil spirits" in Hillary Clinton's office, which is why he summoned three Catholic priests to perform an exorcism. I urge you to do something equally vivid in order to purge the lingering vibes of people and things that you know are no good for you, Aries. Remember, though, that this has nothing to do with perpetrating revenge or harm. It's all about cleansing and reprogramming those parts of you that are still emotionally entangled with the bad influences.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When I was in my twenties, I refused to work for a living because I wanted to live for a living. As a result, I got an extended opportunity to perfect the art of cheerful poverty. One winter, while staying in a ramshackle cottage in North Carolina, my cash reserves got so low that I had to leap to a new level. For meals, I exuberantly retrieved discarded food from dumpsters behind grocery stores. For heat, I gleefully smashed up my wooden furniture with a hammer and threw it in my wood stove. I was the happiest person alive, with lots of leisure time to meditate, read books, write poetry, take long walks, and make love with my girlfriends. Be inspired by my example, Aries. Identify some aspect of your life you tend to regard as inadequate or insufficient, and redefine it to be an asset.

Nineteenth-century English poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti wrote a series of sensual sonnets inspired by his relationship with his wife Elizabeth. Before he could publish them, Elizabeth died. He was so distraught he placed the only copy of his manuscript in the grave with her. Years later, though, he decided the love poems were too good to consign forever to the oblivion of the dirt. He had the coffin disinterred and recovered his work. I suggest you draw inspiration from this story, Aries. Reclaim riches that you once abandoned or left for dead. Halloween costume suggestions: grave-digger, archaeologist, miner, psychic medium who communes with the spirits of the departed.

"Do you know what insomniac dyslexic philosophers do?" asked one of the 20th century's great thinkers, Terence McKenna. "They stay up all night wondering if dog really exists." That just happens to be your assignment, Aries--whether or not you're an insomniac dyslexic philosopher. It's time, in other words, for you to intensify your exploration of life's deepest questions--even as you remember to do so with sparkling good humor and the intention not to take yourself too damn seriously.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to the Midwest Book Review, David Foster Wallace's 1,088-page book Infinite Jest is "perhaps the most innovative novel in the English language since James Joyce's Ulysses." The Review of Contemporary Fiction calls Infinite Jest a vast comic epic, adding that it's "so brilliant you need sunglasses to read it." On the other hand, critic Dan Schneider (Cosmoetica.com) believes *Infinite Jest* "might be the worst novel ever written." I expect that there will be a similar diversity of opinion about you and your efforts in the coming week, Aries. My advice? Ignore everyone's assessment but your own and that of the person who knows you best.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Dear Rob: When my wife got pregnant, she was warned that one side effect might be that her feet would grow a bit. She's now a few months along, and while her feet remain a dainty size 7, my own feet have expanded from size 12 to 13! I've heard husbands sometimes have sensations that parallel their pregnant wives' symptoms, but this is crazy, don't you think? -Vicarious Aries." Dear Vicarious: You Rams are in a phase when your ability to share the feelings and experiences of others is at a peak. I suggest you take advantage of this opening to supercharge your empathy and get closer to your loved ones than you've ever dared.


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Love isn't as simple as you wish it would be. On the other hand, it's nowhere near as complicated as you fear it is. My advice to you is to extinguish any itch you might have to compel love to serve any agenda at whatsoever. Instead, bow down before it with all the innocence you can muster, and declare yourself ready to be its humble student and servant. Celebrate through surrender.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Go against the flow. Buck the system. Push the river. Entertain the possibility that everything you know is at least half-wrong. Do you catch my drift, Aries? What I'm trying to tell you is, champion the underdog. Ignore the obvious. Disprove the conventional wisdom. Bet on the dark horse. Be a devil's advocate. Shall I continue my rant until you have absolutely no doubt what your mission is? Buy a new goldfish and name it "Jaws." Figure out a way to lick your own elbow. Eat with your non-dominant hand. Say prayers while you're having sex. Acquire a pet mosquito. Watch TV while standing on your head. 



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the week ahead. 

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to the theory known as Ducharme's Precept, "Opportunity always knocks at the least opportune moment." I bet you'll soon be living proof of that, Aries. An offer or invitation will come your way in a maddeningly inconvenient way. You'll be tempted to invoke excuses about why you cannot possibly take advantage of it right now. But I hope that instead you leap at the chance with a full and even greedy heart. As annoying as the circumstances might seem, they're exactly what you need in order to bring out the best in you.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Five years ago, I began making daily bike rides all over creation, through neighborhoods and wild spaces alike. Early on, I realized I'd regularly have to deal with loose dogs running toward me with the intent to bite. For protection, I armed myself with pepper spray and yummy treats. In all that time, I'm happy to report, I've squirted just one dog in the face. On the other hand, I've doled out hundreds of dollars' worth of canine snacks. Here's how this relates to your imminent future, Aries: When a beastly influence shows up, you may think you should bring out your equivalent of pepper spray. But I bet that offering treats will serve you better.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Many critics consider Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) to be one of the 20th century's best composers. He is most famous for "Bolero," an orchestral piece that was originally written as the accompaniment for a ballet. The stimulus that served as Ravel's major inspiration for "Bolero" was a visit to a cacophonous steel mill. He's your role model for the coming week, Taurus. I foresee you drawing creative excitement from events that are rife with noise and commotion. May your messy encounters lead you to produce great work, interesting surprises, or both.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

This week I highly recommend that you NOT sit on a photocopier to create images of your buttocks. For reasons too complex to go into here, doing so would put you out of alignment with the cosmic flow. However, now is an excellent time for you to make other strong statements that involve your backside, at least metaphorically. For instance, you will attract fate's favors whenever you get your ass in gear to get to the bottom of things. Luck will also flow your way in direct proportion to how earnestly and rigorously you kick your own butt.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the week ahead. 

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Some studies report that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol regularly is good for your heart. Other research says that's not true at all. Similarly, the frequent use of cell phones either raises the risk for brain cancer or it doesn't; prayer done on behalf of sick people either helps them or it doesn't. Different scientists have come to opposite conclusions on both issues. In fact, contradictory opinions about a wide range of health concerns are now routine. That's just one of several good reasons why you should tune out experts as you tune into your own body, Cancerian. Go in quest of insights about how to promote your physical well-being by trusting your still, small inner voice, not loud, confident authorities.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

You may soon have a dream of beating up the person you were five years ago. This would be a good omen. It means you're ready to wean yourself completely from a stale old self-image. If you dream of feeding caviar and champagne to a donkey, it's also a positive sign. It means you're beginning to recognize that the hard-working beast in you needs to be treated more luxuriously. And if you dream of yelling at a bunch of kids to go clean up their messy bedrooms, Leo, that's an auspicious portent as well. It signifies your readiness to discipline the irresponsible habits and organize the unruly impulses of your inner child.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"People rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing," said motivational author Dale Carnegie. Those should be your words to live by for the rest of 2006. It's time for you to become almost ruthless in your intention to enjoy yourself as you carry out your life's work. I'm tempted to go so far as to say that you should disentangle yourself from any commitment in which duty overshadows pleasure. Your drive to do good deeds and be of use to people will ultimately fall short unless you love what you do.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

You've slipped into the Anything-Goes Zone. It has resemblances to a duty-free store in an international airport, a speakeasy during the Prohibition Era, and the more benign areas of the Twilight Zone. There you may very well experience events that seem to happen off the record and days that take place outside of time. You could feel like you're in a buffer zone or waiting room--a nerve-wracking sanctuary where you're safe and yet filled with doubts and pregnant questions. At least half the cards will be wild. Exceptions to the rules will be the rule. My advice? Experiment ingeniously.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Recently, less than five percent of the world's astronomers voted to demote Pluto from a planet to a "dwarf planet." Some Scorpios were alarmed, since Pluto is the heavenly body that traditionally rules your sign. My opinion? Don't worry. I agree with mythologist Roxanna Bikadoroff, who says there's poetic justice in calling Pluto a dwarf planet. In fairy tales, dwarves are often magicians who possess hidden storehouses of riches and act as agents of creative transformation. They typically live beneath bridges, which are symbols of transitional thresholds, and are masters of in-between states. They bestow blessings on anyone who is able to pass their demanding tests. This is an apt symbolic description of you at your most potent, which I expect you to be during the coming weeks.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

An adventurer named Brian Walker has plans to climb aboard a homemade missile and launch himself 20 miles into the sky using a giant crossbow. According to Wired magazine, he has figured out all the angles, including how to descend, and will probably pull off the feat without killing himself. It so happens that you also have the potential to propel yourself higher, farther, and faster than maybe you've ever gone, though in a safer and more metaphorical way. What's the closest symbolic analogue you have to a giant crossbow?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Help! Pluto's not a planet any more! Won't that disastrously tweak astrological theory? Actually, no. Nothing whatsoever has changed about Pluto in its role as a revealer of cosmic portents. All that has shifted are the ideas about Pluto that reside in the minds of 424 astronomers who were at the International Astronomical Union's conference in Prague. ("I'm embarrassed for astronomy," said Alan Stearn, science chief of NASA's mission to Pluto. "Less than 5 percent of the world's astronomers voted on the change.") Still, it's important to note how many millions of people take this tiny group's delusions seriously. Let this be a reminder for you to be very discriminating about whose definitions you choose to believe. Use it as a prod to be more aggressive in giving your own names and frames to life's mysteries.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

You don't need any special climbing skills to reach the top of Tanzania's Mt. Kilimanjaro. It's the highest walkable mountain in the world. That doesn't mean it's an easy conquest. You've got to be in good physical shape. To avoid altitude sickness, you must ascend gradually enough to acclimatize yourself to steadily decreasing levels of oxygen. This happens to be an apt metaphor for the current state of your fate, Aquarius. You have a chance to begin a project that could lead you to a summit with inspiring vistas.  You don't need to master any exotic new skills to do it, and can pull it off as long as you're patient, take good care of yourself, and are willing to both respect your limits and push yourself harder than usual.

"There is nothing worse than a brilliant image of a fuzzy concept," said photographer Ansel Adams. That advice should be uppermost in your mind as you follow your bliss to the next fork in the road. Although you've got good intuitions about the hopeful scenario that's fueling you, the fantasy still needs to be fleshed out a lot more. Unless you make it more specific and detailed, it will eventually fizzle. Here's your assignment: By the equinox, create a vivid image of a well-crafted, intricately imagined goal.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Weekly World News suggests that we celebrate a new holiday this week, National Hate Day. For 24 hours, it would be socially acceptable to drain off the rancid opinions, bitter spleen, and sickening ideas we've been hoarding. While every sign of the zodiac can profit from this massive purge of psychic pus, no one has as much need or would experience more healthful benefits than you Aries. For best results, add a touch of humor to your howls, and don't you dare actually hurt anyone. Screaming gibberish into a lavender-scented pillow is especially recommended.

"In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts," wrote American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson. "They come back to us with a certain alienated majesty." The first part of your assignment, Taurus, is to identify other people's brilliant creations that remind you of good ideas of your own that you've failed to develop. The second part of your assignment is to do something--anything!--to correct for your neglect. Get started on your own masterpiece.

In 1957, when Melba Pattillo Beals was 15 years old, she and eight other students volunteered to be the first African Americans to integrate all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. For months, she and her cohorts were spat upon, beat up, and threatened with death by bigots. Her grandmother stayed awake all night holding a loaded shotgun, guarding the family home against assaults. Years later Beals wrote Warriors Don't Cry, a memoir of that traumatic time. I have a psychotherapist friend in Seattle who gives copies of this book to certain clients who are inclined to inflate their own suffering. "Read about Beals' ordeal," she tells them, "and you'll feel less overwhelmed by your own problems." That's your assignment, Gemini. Study people whose lot in life is far worse than yours. Get some perspective.

Praising actor Jim Carrey at the MTV Movie Awards, Will Ferrell proclaimed "This man's versatility makes Thomas Jefferson look like a big fat idiot." That's rather hyperbolic, considering that Jefferson was not only President of the United States, but also an architect, author, musician, horticulturist, lawyer, archaeologist, inventor, surveyor, and mathematician. Let's say, to be more accurate, that Carrey is maybe five percent as versatile as Jefferson. That will help you get a realistic understanding of my meaning when I tell you that though you may not make Jim Carrey look like a big fat idiot in the coming weeks, you'll have the potential to match his multifaceted, adaptable, puttylike resourcefulness.

When offered a choice between dueling interpretations, you should opt for elegant and generous stories over vulgar, boring, and unimaginative tales. While the no-nonsense, just-the-facts approach may seem to explain everything just fine, I assure you that there will always be catalytic enigmas lurking beneath the surface. This is one time when poet John Keats' rule will be in full effect: "If something is not beautiful, it is probably not true." Transcend the obvious, please. Rebel against the ravaging numbness of plain old everyday ugliness.

Editors at the prestigious UK medical journal Lancet have called for the legalization of LSD and other psychedelic drugs. They're not envisioning a thousand totally buzzed freaks dancing deliriously at an outdoor festival, however. Rather, they want to make it possible for researchers to carefully explore the therapeutic benefits of altering consciousness. "The blanket ban on psychedelic drugs continues to hinder safe and controlled investigation of their potential benefits," they said. Be inspired by their example, Virgo. What taboo is it high time for you to break in a discerning way? What inhibition no longer serves you, even though at one time it might have kept you safe and sane? What conventional wisdom based on fear has infected you, preventing you from experimenting with exciting possibilities?

I really encourage you to have a celebration. The planets are urging you to revel and rejoice, too. I wouldn't be surprised if God Herself is rooting for you to whip up festivities worthy of a jubilee. So what are you waiting for? What? You say you don't have anything to celebrate? I beg to differ. How about extolling the end of your addiction to a time-wasting delusion? Or maybe the loss of a "privilege" that encouraged you to be lazy, or the end of a false hope that kept you stuck in the past? How about if you throw a party to express your gratitude at finally being forced to embrace a creative limitation that will ultimately set you free?

What happens to buttered toast when it accidentally falls off a table? According to folk wisdom, it's more likely to land buttered face down, and hence create a bigger mess than if it had fallen dry side down. In a research paper published in the European Journal of Physics, Robert A. J. Matthews scientifically verified that this folk wisdom is accurate. Or at least it is when conditions are normal. But conditions are far from normal for you, Scorpio. Cosmic assistance and good luck are flowing your way in such abundance that they're rendering some laws of nature temporarily irrelevant. If you knock your toast off the table each morning for the next 15 days (and it's quite possible you will, given how excitable you are), it's not likely to ever fall butter-side down.

"If you want to upset the law that all crows are black," wrote William James, "you mustn't show that no crows are; it is enough if you prove one single crow to be white." Philosopher Jonathan Zap applies this idea to his ruminations about telepathy. He says that if there is even one irrefutable case in which two minds have communicated with each other at a distance and without the aid of technology, then telepathy must be a fundamental human capacity. I believe this is an important line of thought for you to consider, Sagittarius. Why? Because you've entered the Season of the White Crow.

If you were at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert right now, you might be racing your souped-up tricycle through a miniature golf course-style maze while dressed in a superhero costume, after which you'd enjoy a sushi dinner served on the naked belly of a good-looking clown. Or maybe you'd be exploring the benefits of a short duration marriage to a temporary soulmate selected for you by a seven-year-old girl deity sitting on a neon green plastic throne surrounded by a circle of flame. Since you're probably not at Burning Man, however, you've got to find other ways to carry out your astrological mandate, which is to enjoy semi-crazy acts of liberation you'd normally never try.

"Why just ask the donkey in me to speak to the donkey in you when I have so many other beautiful animals and brilliant colored birds inside that are all longing to say something wonderful and exciting to your heart?" That's the question Daniel Ladinsky asks in his translation of a poem by the Persian mystic poet Hafiz. I'd like you to ponder it, Aquarius. You're in a phase when you have an exceptional ability to bring out the best and brightest in your allies. Uncoincidentally, doing that will result in your allies having a magical ability to bring out the best and brightest in you.

If you're alert, people whose magic you had become deadened to will reveal stirring secrets. Places you've visited a thousand times may seem to have undergone an overnight transformation, exposing you to a series of mini-awakenings that ultimately add up to a full-blown aha. You may find yourself penetrating to the heart of mysteries that you previously didn't even realize were mysteries. By week's end, if you're brave enough to keep welcoming the surprises, you will be ripped free from an especially sneaky illusion and reunited with a lost fragment of your soul.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Baksheesh" is a term derived from the Persian term for "gift." Among travelers in the Third World, it has several meanings, among which are these: (1) bribes paid to authorities to get them to stop hassling you; (2) tips given to strangers who insist on being of assistance by, say, opening a door for you even if you don't want them to. I believe baksheesh will soon serve as an apt metaphor for you, Aries. Be ready to offer compensation to people in order to get them to both stop bothering you and stop "helping" you. (P.S.: The compensation you give may not necessarily be in the form of cash. It could be flattery, presents, or useful information.)

The biggest food fight on the planet will soon take place. More than 20,000 lunatic combatants will gather in the Spanish town of Bu√±ol to hurl 45 tons of overripe tomatoes and other veggies at each other. Maybe you should book a flight there, Taurus. You'd do yourself a big favor by indulging in senseless but harmless mayhem that allows you to lose control in the name of fun. Nothing would be more healing than a big dose of maniacal fervor.

Russ Kick searches for messy facts that lie half-hidden beneath the official versions of reality. In his two volumes entitled 50 Things You're Not Supposed to Know, he reveals, for example, that most corporations don't pay federal income taxes, George Washington embezzled government money, a third of all American homeless men are military veterans, and Shakespeare filled his plays with sexual references. Russ Kick is your role model, Gemini. May he inspire you to find out about at least three things you're not "supposed" to know. May you adopt his brazen approach as you breeze in to off-limits areas to get the scoop on tantalizing truths that have been missing in action.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Throughout history there have been secret schools that don't advertise their existence. To enroll, students must either be invited or else stumble on them by chance. In post-Renaissance Europe, for example, Rosicrucian mystery schools taught an esoteric form of Christianity at odds with the Church. Seventeenth-century English poet Andrew Marvell and his cohorts had their underground School of the Night, and ancient Greek poet Sappho stealthily gathered young women at her Moisopholon, "House of the Muses." In recent years the Sexy Bratty Genius School has periodically convened classes at 3 a.m. under a highway overpass in San Francisco. According to my reading of the current omens, Cancerian, you're close to making contact with a similar source of teaching. Whether you end up actually matriculating depends on how you answer the question, "Do you want to learn about things you've considered impossible?"

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Psychologists Ed Diener and Martin E.P. Seligman cite 150 studies that suggest economic factors have little to do with happiness levels. For example, the Masai of Kenya, whose per capita income is under $300 a year, are as satisfied with their lives as the 400 wealthiest plutocrats in America. People living in the slums of Calcutta are slightly less filled with well-being, but not much. Your assignment, Leo, is to explore the personal implications of this. Can you get to the point where you truly feel that your ability to enjoy life has little to with how much money you have?

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Philosopher George Gurdjieff declared that most of us are essentially asleep, even as we walk around in broad daylight. We're ignorant about the higher levels of awareness we're capable of; we're blind to the continuous flow of life's miraculous blessings. He said that in order to wake up and stay awake we need regular shocks. Some of these are uncomfortable, forcing us to face our own stupidity. But other shocks are delightful. They're doses of sacred medicine that entice us to shake off our sleepiness and come to attention in pleasurable ways. I believe that in the coming weeks you'll be offered a steady supply of the latter.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

At the BFD concert near San Francisco in June, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' lead singer Karen O screamed for two minutes and 17 seconds straight. (I timed it.) I recommend that you set aside some quality time in the next two weeks to experiment with big outbreaks of self-expression that resemble hers. It's the Purge and Purify Season for you--a time when you should indulge in high-spirited activities that exorcise your demons, wash your brain, and incite toe-curling, sweat-inducing, soul-animating catharses.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

An artist in Santa Fe, New Mexico built a replica of England's famous Stonehenge. But instead of using huge slabs of rock to mimic the original, Adam Horowitz erected his spectacular monument with 200 old refrigerators. Hence its name: Stonefridge. This would be a perfect time for you to draw inspiration from his efforts, Scorpio. Create your own personal imitation of a resource you love--a beautifully funky, playfully accessible substitute for a marvel that is impossible for you to own or control.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

As I contemplate your week ahead, I can't help but think of the Butthole Surfers' song "Pepper": "They were drinking from a fountain / that was pouring like an avalanche / coming down the mountain." Are you ready for much, much more of everything that interests and stimulates you, Sagittarius? Can you imagine what you'd have to do to expand your capacity for big emotions and provocative sensations? Of course not: No one can be fully prepared for an avalanche. But do the wildest best you can, and your lust for life will provide you with all the intuitions you need.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

It's Fake Smile Week. On the one hand, that means you should be on guard for people who are pretending to feel better than they actually do. I urge you to forgive them for their deception, but don't get derailed by it. On the other hand, you yourself should put on a happy face as a disguise when you're not sure what exactly is going on. In other words, it's best to act agreeable until you gather all the information necessary to make a sound decision. Is the advice I'm offering hypocritical? Only if you use it to serve your narrow self-interests. But if you're intent on doing what's best for all concerned, my counsel is ethically impeccable.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

At the Coachella music festival, I found myself next to a guy sporting a rainbow mohawk and wearing a red, white, and blue speedo, black socks, golf shoes, a striped necktie, angel wings, a red clown nose, and a battered hard hat with a sticker that read "Martinis and brown rice." At one point he turned to me and said, "You know what I like most about being an Aquarius? It's a never-ending opportunity to send out mixed messages in a friendly, non-manipulative way." That got me to thinking about how most of us are addicted to thinking in simplistic categories and obsessed with making sense. Sending out mixed messages, therefore, can be valuable if it's done in a spirit of compassionate play, because it subverts those bad habits. Of all the signs in the zodiac, you Aquarians do this best. I hope you ply your specialty lavishly in the coming weeks. People in your life have an acute need to get their certainties scrambled.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You've entered the Intimacy Intensification Season. Are you ready to dive deeper into the mysteries of togetherness? If so, you'll meet provocative candidates for future alliances, and people you already know and love will become more available. As you can imagine, it'll be crucial for you to study the truths of your own heart with ruthless honesty. There'll be no excuse for getting tangled up with so-called "pleasures" that don't really activate your most fervent zeal. Exercise extreme discrimination, please, even as you seek out thrills that make you brilliantly crazy.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I was at an airport bookstore. A businessman near me plucked Chuck Palahniuk's Haunted from the shelf and said to his companion, "I've heard this book makes some people actually vomit. Listen to this passage." He read it aloud. It was about a guy who eats ten freeze-dried turkey dinners, and dies when his stomach literally explodes. Moments after reciting this gruesome tale, the businessman collapsed and went into convulsions. I knelt down and cradled his head. A saleswoman called paramedics, and 15 minutes later he was fine. "That never happened to me before," he said. "I don't have epilepsy. It must have been a reaction to what I read." The moral of the story, Aries: Words will have potent effects on you in the coming days. You should therefore surround yourself not with Palahniuk-type curses but with good news and uplifting stories and people who dispense articulate blessings.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

I heard a guy on the radio tell the following story. He and his wife stopped to enjoy a sunset. After a few minutes, they noticed that its breathtaking beauty remained static; the scene wasn't evolving. Upon further investigation, they registered the embarrassing fact that they had actually been admiring an image on a billboard. Make sure a similar event doesn't happen to you, Taurus. Avoid getting hooked on substitutes, stand-ins, or simulacrums. Insist on the real thing.

In her song "Deeper Well," Emmylou Harris says she's "looking for the water from a deeper well." Make that your assignment, Gemini. And if you're feeling brave, extend your search to an even more challenging quest: what Harris refers to as searching for a "holier grail." According to my reading of the omens, your biggest, brightest dream isn't as big and bright as it could be. Raise your standards.

The omens suggest that you're most likely to be happy and healthy in the coming weeks if you treat the whole world as your classroom. Thank God, then, that you won't suffer anytime soon from sophophobia (a fear of learning) or optophobia (fear of opening one's eyes). It's my duty to inform you, however, that you could experience politicophobia (fear of politicians) or myxophobia (fear of slime). Ironically, that would be quite lucky, because it's crucial that you avoid manipulative power-brokers and mud-slinging know-it-alls who might confuse you about the educational experiences you need to pursue.

"Raising kids is like making pancakes," muses Brian Copeland in his show Not a Genuine Black Man. "You always mess up the first one." A similar idea might apply to a certain multi-pronged project you've been working on, Leo. I'm not saying you should abandon or throw away your initial effort. On the contrary, like rookie parents whose inexperience has slightly tweaked their first-born, you should be thorough in trying to undo your mistakes. But I also suggest that you immediately get started on the next creation in the series, being sure you've learned all you can from the consequences of your earlier ignorance.

My old philosophy professor Norman O. Brown would periodically interrupt his lectures, tilt his head upward as if tuning into the whisper of some heavenly voice, and announce in a mischievous tone, "It's time for your irregular reminder: We're already living after the end of the world. No need to fret anymore." The implication was that the worst had already happened. We had already lost most of the cultural riches that had given humans meaning for centuries. All that was going to be taken from us had already been taken. On the bright side, that meant we were utterly free to reinvent ourselves. Living amidst the emptiness, we had nowhere to go but up. What remained was alienating, but it was also fresh. Use these ideas as seeds for your meditations, Virgo. You can apply them to both your personal life and the world at large.

Novelist Jeanette Winterson told a TV interviewer about her mother's strongest belief: "You can be happy, or else you can be like normal people." This idea applies to you right now, Libra--maybe more than you realize. From what I can tell, you're at a crossroads in your relationship with happiness. You could go either way, and it's mostly up to you: Will you tame your urges for wild joy, repress your instincts to follow your lyrically crazy heart, and surrender to the dull insanity of the maddening crowd? Or would you prefer the scarier, more eccentric and action-packed route that will constantly push you to enlarge your capacity to feel good?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Sculptor Luis Jimenez was renowned for making large pieces with political themes that incited controversy. In "The Barfly," created during the Vietnam War, he depicted the Statue of Liberty as a drunken floozy. "Vaquero" shows a Mexican cowboy riding a bucking stallion and waving a gun. It not only satirizes the pretentious statues of military leaders on horses that are often found in parks; it's also a reminder that the original cowboys of the American West were Mexicans. "It's not my job to censor myself," Jimenez said. "An artist's job is to constantly test the boundaries." Whether or not you're an artist yourself, Scorpio, your next assignment is aligned with Jimenez's approach: Don't censor yourself as you test the boundaries.

There are now as many people working at Wal-Mart stores as there are high-school teachers. Can anything be done to change this depressing state of affairs? Well, it so happens that the time is ripe for you Sagittarians to cultivate your skill at sharing what you know. It's also an excellent phase to cultivate your ability to inspire and energize your fellow humans. So if just one percent of you use this pregnant moment as a springboard to launch careers as high-school educators, Wal-Mart employees would no longer outnumber you and your heroic colleagues. And even if you personally decide not to go in that direction, I hope you at least think more about what you have to teach the world, and take steps to give your gifts more aggressively.

Philosopher Robert Anton Wilson said that "the universe acts like a chess game in which the player on the other side remains invisible to us. By analyzing the moves, we can form an image of the intellect behind them." The coming weeks will be an excellent time for you to gain insights into that other chess player, Capricorn. You will have an extraordinary capacity for setting aside your own subjective mind-chatter and seeing the objective truth. You'll also be more skilled than usual at understanding what's going on in the shadows and darkness. The hidden world is whispering secrets in codes you can crack.

It's time for you to fall in love, Aquarius--though not necessarily with a person. You could swoon with infatuation for a place where your heart feels free, for example. You could dive into new music that liberates you from your past, or give yourself with abandon to a fascinating task that brings out the best in you. You might lose your heart to a mind-expanding mentor, a mysterious animal, or a thrilling fight for justice. It really doesn't matter exactly how or what you fall in love with, Aquarius, as long as it incites you to break open the doors of perception.

Last week's symbol was a boot kicking with futility at a closed door that was locked in response to your kicking; it bespoke a frustrated strength that provoked even greater resistance. This week's symbol will be dramatically different: bare feet climbing a rope ladder to a dance floor on a roof where a telescope is trained on the planet Jupiter. In this new phase, there will still be obstacles for you to overcome. But the emphasis will be on craft and agility rather than force and instinct. And this time around the most grounded part of you will find lots of luck and slack.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In 1986, an accident at the Chernobyl power plant in the Ukraine caused a nuclear meltdown. Radioactive waste spewed into the air, making the area uninhabitable. Twenty years later, humans are still absent, but wildlife is thriving. Native populations of badgers, wild boars, and deer have multiplied, and species that had disappeared before the disaster, like the lynx and eagle owl, have returned in abundance. Birds are even nesting in the steel and concrete "sarcophagus" built over the exploded reactor. This is not to say that everything's peachy. There are many problems lingering from the original devastation. I propose to you, Aries, that the situation in Chernobyl is a metaphor for something in your personal life. A place within you that endured a trauma has rebounded surprisingly, though it's still wounded. Take inventory, then raise the ante on the healing process.

The UK is populated by hordes of "overweight, alco-pop-swilling, sex-and-celebrity-obsessed television addicts," according to the travel book Rough Guide to England. I recommend, therefore, that you avoid traveling to that part of the world if you're a sensitive person who's susceptible to taking on the attitudes of the people around you. The astrological omens suggest that you should take stringent measures to exorcise any impulses you might have to indulge in excessive consumption of bad food, numbing intoxicants, superficial sex, dumbed-down entertainment, and mindless gossip about famous lightweights. For that matter, you should be ruthless in sealing yourself off from influences that tend to bring out the worst and the mediocre parts of you.

Your assignment is to expand the variety and explore the frontiers of your familiar pleasures.

A reader named Amanda Jarosz has offered an alternative to the traditional name for our astrological sign: Canswer, a blend of "can" and "answer." It's not a viable long-term solution, but it would make a lot of sense in the immediate future. Here's why. According to my analysis of the omens, you'll be able to get a useful answer to just about any question as long as you craft it with thoughtful precision. So for example, "How can I get more love?" is a sloppy formulation that won't yield fruitful insights, whereas "What long-term plan can I set in motion that will help me earn more of the care and blessings I deserve from doing what I'm good at?" will be a gem.

A few weeks ago, eight-year-old Harrison Vonderau was playing golf with his dad on a course in Cleveland when he shot a hole-in-one. Father and son experienced an even more shocking delight 20 minutes later when the boy scored yet another hole-in-one. It was an almost unbelievable accomplishment for anyone, let alone a kid. Harrison is your role model for the coming week, Leo. I predict that a young part of you--either your inner child or your inner teenager--will score an unlikely and spectacular coup, the equivalent of two holes-in-one.

Of all the times in your life when you have been in captivity, this has to be one of the least arduous and frustrating ever. I'll go so far as to say that I have rarely seen a more beautiful prisoner than you; for a drudge in bondage, you're ravishing. As hard as it may be to contemplate, however, it's almost time to escape. Your dark though sexy night of the soul will soon come to an end. Don't you dare linger any longer than you have to.

USA Today did a profile on business guru Doug Hall, who's famous for his unconventional approaches to stimulating creativity. One of his techniques is "left brain, right brain storming." Transcending plain old everyday brainstorming, it's done with a team that blends people who specialize in rational, linear thought (left brain) and those who are skilled at letting their imaginations go a little crazy (right brain). May I suggest you try it out? The coming week is a perfect time to undo your attraction to what has always worked before, and start heading in the direction of the unknown future.

Physicists at Washington University in St. Louis have found that introducing disorder into certain messy situations may actually spawn order. It happened as they worked with a network of interconnected pendulums that were all waving around chaotically. When they brought random forces to bear on the tumult, the pendulums locked into sync. The physicists' results may not necessarily imply a universal law you should invoke in every circumstance, but it does happen to be applicable to you right now. The more unpredictable, effervescent, and even unruly you are--especially in the face of confusing circumstances--the better chance you will have of generating elegant success, and maybe even some beauty, truth, and love as well.

In Britain's last census, 390,000 people declared themselves to be members of the Jedi faith--a fictional religion depicted in the Star Wars movies. That was heartening to those of us who lobby for a wider array of belief systems. My ultimate hope, however, is for there to be 6.5 billion different religions--a singular form of worship for each person on the planet. It happens to be a perfect astrological phase for you to advance that cause, Sagittarius: to break out of the pack and fashion your own unique spiritual path. It's also an excellent time to dream up a new political party that intimately reflects every one of your idiosyncratic views, and to identify yourself as a member of a brand new racial or ethnic group that has never before been defined. Whip up your own niches!

Recently my nine-year-old bike has developed an unfortunate glitch. When I ride up hills, and only when I ride up hills, the chain periodically gets lodged in the transmission mechanism. If I act quickly, taking action the instant I hear the incipient grinding noise, there's something I can do to fix the problem and keep from lurching to a halt: I have to temporarily pedal backwards; doing that frees the chain from its stuck place. So picture this scene: As I ascend, I'm able to push forward for long stretches, but now and then have to pedal in reverse, slipping backward a few feet. From what I can tell, Capricorn, this is similar to the rhythm your life has right now. It's OK to bitch about it, as I do during my travail, but you should also feel grateful for the way it's building your strength and character. P.S. I predict you will reach the top by September.

The often-inebriated Calamity Jane character on HBO's TV show Deadwood uttered words that are important for you to take to heart. I'll paraphrase her observation in order to streamline her drunken syntax: "Every day you have to figure out how to live all over again." Of course this is always true, Aquarius, but it's even more intensely apt for you right now. The good news is that you'll be unusually skilled at deciphering the ever-changing rules of the master game, and you're also likely to have maximum fun while doing so.

"Anger or bitterness toward those who have hurt you will block your path to higher ground," said inspirational author Vernon Howard. "You can have anger toward people or you can have freedom from people, but you can't have both." I suggest you make that one of your guiding thoughts in the coming week, Pisces. An undreamed-of burst of liberation is now possible for you if you compel yourself to experiment with radical generosity on the wild frontiers of forgiveness.

Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, columnist Jon Carroll told the story of educational activist Diane Mintz. When she began tutoring elementary school kids in the Bay Area's poorest neighborhoods, she was shocked to realize how thoroughly poverty had shrunken their horizons. Many had never glimpsed the Golden Gate Bridge, a wonder of the world that's a few miles from their homes. Some didn't even know this marvel existed. "Their mental map of their larger community was pinched and drab," wrote Carroll. On occasion, those of us who aren't so destitute suffer from a similar diminishment. For example, I suspect that many of you Tauruses are in danger of letting your vistas dwindle right now. As a pre-emptive antidote, I suggest you make pilgrimages to beautiful people and intriguing sights and exhilarating places that blow your mind in the best ways.

Ocean Dome is a huge indoor beach and water park on an island in Japan. Fabricated to create the ideal seaside conditions, it features artificial white sand and machine-generated waves that are high enough to surf. Air and water temperatures never waver from a comfortable range. There's an amusing irony about the place, though: Less than 1,000 feet away from its metal facade, there's an actual ocean and beach. Does this remind you of any situation in your own life, Gemini? It should. In my opinion, you'd get more enjoyment out of the real thing than the synthetic substitute.

The number of people turning to this column for guidance and amusement continues to climb. My Google ranking among astrology sites on the Web is holding steady at sixth in the world. Recently I also received the coveted Nostradamus Lifetime Achievement Award for Prophecy and Divination. Should I therefore ask for more money from everyone who publishes my column? I've decided against that because--surprise!--I'm quite happy with how everything's going. You, on the other hand, should think about raising your rates. Those of us who are born under the sign of Cancer the Crab are in a phase when it makes sense to acknowledge our accomplishments and make sure we're being compensated properly for them.

"Sometimes it's not how good you are but how bad you want it," read the t-shirt of a guy buying a lottery ticket at the convenience store. While I don't think he was making the best use of that philosophy--playing a game of chance heavily weighted against his success--I do think it's a principle worth meditating on, especially for you right now, Leo. Your skill and understanding are certainly not irrelevant as you push to the next level of your quest, but they are less important than the intensity of your longing.

"If you are going through hell, keep going," said Winston Churchill. Let that advice be your inspiration in the coming week, Virgo. But wait: Before you jump to conclusions about what I'm saying, know this: Your tests and trials will be far, far less hellish than the ordeals Churchill faced as he led England through World War II. It's true that you may feel a bit tortured in the heat of the moment, though. So don't you dare slow down to feel sorry for yourself or scream at the chaos-makers. Keep plodding forward, secure in my assurance that you'll cross the border and exit out of the infernal regions well before you're exhausted.

But the governor vetoed the bill, declaring that schools need the revenue from nutrient-free chips, sodas, and candy bars to finance their sports programs. Besides, he said, kids would much rather snack on junk food than the healthful fare. If you're faced with a similar choice this week--whether to do what's good for you or else indulge your vices and seek out meaningless experiences that provide no fulfillment--please go for the former option. The astrological omens suggest that this is a turning point, for better or worse, in your relationship with your bad habits.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the week ahead. 

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In 1993, my American friend Mark started playing music on the streets of Copenhagen. His parents regarded it as a tragedy. "This is what you do with the fine education we bought you?" they mourned. "What a waste!" grumbled his siblings and college friends. Mark was hurt, but didn't shrink from his mission, eventually expanding his open-air performances to Ireland and Holland. Thirteen years later, Mark has accumulated so much wealth from his gig that he has been able to buy homes in Ireland and Hawaii. Though he still busks part-time, he spends nine months of the year writing books. He's your patron saint in the coming weeks, Sagittarius. May he inspire you to follow your dreams no matter how much that bothers the people who think they own you.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Are you a force of nature right now, or are you a freak of nature? I think the truth is that you're a freaky force of nature. You're just about as anomalous as it's possible for a Capricorn to get, and yet you've also got the equivalent of a thunderstorm's energy at your command. The funny thing is, the two factors are related. Your eccentricity is feeding your power, and vice versa. My advice is to refrain from questioning and worrying about this unusual state of affairs, and instead just capitalize on the odd advantages you have at your disposal.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

This is a favorable time for you to conjure up an imaginary friend who also happens to be a muse. You can pretend that he or she is perfectly real, just invisible. Or you can fantasize that he or she is a mostly buried part of you that you rarely express, or maybe your ideal of what a friend should be. I urge you to give this ally a name. Visualize his or her vivid personality and appearance in detail. See the world through his or her eyes. Have dialogues, exchange confidential information, hold hands, and soak up the balm of your tender communion.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Some of the most gorgeous animals on the planet are also the most toxic to eat, writes Carol Kaesuk Yoon in The New York Times. Iridescent butterflies and fluorescent frogs are among the beauties that fit this description. Many are downright poisonous, and others are just plain foul-tasting. Keep that in mind as a helpful metaphor during the coming weeks, Pisces. Attractive people and enticing invitations may not always be what they seem. Sometimes they may be exactly what they seem, however, which is why it's so important for you to be exceedingly discriminating. Enjoy the view for a while and get a sense of what's beneath the surface before you taste them.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"The honest man must be a perpetual renegade," said French essayist Charles P√©guy. The honest woman must be one, too, I would add. While that's always a good rule to keep in mind, it will be especially apropos for you in the coming weeks, Aries. If you hope to remain true to yourself and in alignment with your highest integrity, you will have to maintain a rebellious vigilance. By the way, that does not mean you should constantly be agitated, fuming, and off-kilter. On the contrary, the healthiest insurrectionary fervor you can muster will be full of exuberance and joie de vivre.

"One morning I came upon a small demonstration on a street corner," wrote Sparrow in The Sun. "Several men were holding signs that said BRING BACK DUSK, and shouting, 'Dusk! Give us dusk!' 'But dusk will come again this evening,' I pointed out to one of them. 'We don¬ít care,' he replied, with a wild look. 'We want it now!'" If and when you become impatient in the coming week, Taurus, remember Sparrow's story. Progress will proceed at its own pace, not yours. The peaches will ripen when they are ready, not necessarily when you are.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

In their article "Most Popular Myths in Science", editors at LiveScience.com analyzed ideas that are dear to conventional wisdom. They debunked the notions that lightning never strikes twice in the same place, that humans only use ten percent of their brains, and that it's safe to eat food that has been on the floor for less than five seconds. But they affirmed certain other "myths." A falling cat does pretty much always land on its feet, they found. Yawning is indeed contagious. Eating two poppy seed bagels can produce a positive result for opiates on a drug test. I bring this up, Gemini, as a prod to get you to take inventory of your own opinions, assumptions, and storylines. This is a perfect moment to not just question your beliefs, but to give them the third degree.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The dreams you have in the coming nights may be disturbing. Eagles may be dive-bombing warm and fuzzy little sheep. Lions may be pouncing on gentle deer and big bullies may be stealing the lunch money of cute little kids on the playground. You should not, however, view these dreams as bad omens. If you respond to them correctly, they will not turn out to be prophecies about literal developments in your waking life. And what is the correct response? Toughen up the part of you whose feelings are too easily hurt. Strengthen the protection that surrounds your vulnerabilities. Stand up for yourself with a courage that is graceful, not macho.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Travel writer Bruce Chatwin walked around Australia as he researched and meditated on the indigenous people's beliefs about what the land was like in the ancient past. He wrote: "Aboriginal creation myths tell of the legendary totemic beings who wandered over the continent in the Dreamtime, singing out the name of everything that crossed their path--birds, animals, plants, rocks, waterholes--and so singing the world into existence." Given the fact that you're now primed to create a new domain or two, Leo, may I suggest the aborigines' approach? You'll infuse everything with extra beauty if you play around with singing it into existence.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Once upon a time, you asked a certain someone for a blessing. Instead, he or she blasted you with a curse. The debilitating blow of that bad magic hit you right smack in the place that was ripe for the blessing you requested. What a tragedy! Now, at last, you're wise and strong enough to defeat the power of that old curse. Here's the first step: Understand that the seed of the blessing you once needed (and still need) is hidden within and obscured by the curse. Figure out what that blessing is, and it will reveal to you what to do next. (P.S.: The French word for "wound" is blessure. It suggests that blessing can come from wounding.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I foresee the possibility of a Jerry Springer kind of week ahead for some of you Libras. You might seek romantic relationships with incarcerated criminals, or embark on a diet that requires you to eat three pints of ice cream per day, or try to take out your frustrations by spitting in the faces of unhinged teenage boys in mosh pits at punk concerts. On the other hand, there is also the possibility that many of you Libras will be pursuing unusual departures from the routine that would be more appreciated by the Dalai Lama than Jerry Springer. For instance, you might teach your skills to a class in a penitentiary, or go on a juice fast to purify yourself in preparation for a confrontation with abusive authorities, or express your righteous indignation at injustice by volunteering at a battered women's shelter. Whether you go more in the direction of Jerry Springer or the Dalai Lama will all depend on how craftily you wield your free will.

Many people regard Evangeline Lilly, star of TV's Lost, as an exceptionally attractive woman. When she was younger, that was a problem for her. "I spent many nights crying myself to sleep," she has said, "wishing I was ugly because of the way men leered at and disrespected me." In my studies of human nature, I've found that most of us, like Lilly, have had a tormented relationship with our most extravagant assets. Fortunately for you, Scorpio, you now have an enhanced capacity to be at peace with and thoroughly enjoy the potent effects your beauty and power have on the world.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Philosopher Robert Anton Wilson wrote an article called "How to Live Eleven Days in 24 Hours." I'm borrowing the title to serve as your theme in the coming days. Your instinct for smart risks is finely tuned, and your ability to cram adroit intensity into every one of your experiences is high--so much so that you could probably harvest eleven days' worth of sexy lessons in several different 24-hour periods just ahead.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Hundreds of articles in medical journals claiming to be written by academics or doctors have been penned by ghostwriters in the pay of drug companies," according to The Observer. Is this one more sign of corruption in the pharmaceutical industry? Yes. And further evidence that you should be very skeptical of all authorities everywhere? Sure. But it's also a metaphor that could prove useful to keep in mind as you navigate your way through the riddles you'll soon encounter. Be alert for the possibility that what you see is not what you're actually getting. There may be manipulative powers behind the throne . . . stand-ins pretending to be the real thing . . . mouthpieces that hide the true source of their message.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

This week should be pretty CRUNCHALICIOUS, Aquarius. You know, crisp and delectable, chewy and pleasing to your inner four-year-old--like a breakfast cereal with three different sweet tastes packed into puff balls that softly explode in your mouth. The only potential problem is that you could keep wolfing down the treats without any regard for how the experience might make you feel later. I suggest that you enjoy the feast slowly, pausing every now and then to monitor whether you're close to being excessively stimulated or over-satiated.

Some observers have expressed derisive opinions about Guy Boos, a Wisconsin man who hurled his washing machine down a flight of stairs and pumped it full of bullets with his .25-caliber gun. I, on the other hand, admire those who take out their frustration and rage on inanimate objects rather than on animals or other human beings. That's why I advise you to consider Boos' methodology if you find yourself on the verge of boiling over, Pisces. Don't repress your negative feelings, but find a way to express them that doesn't cost you anything more than a little money.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of a new chapter in your own personal soap opera. It could include any of the following plot twists: midnight confessions, madcap sex farces, thumb-sucking saints, an invitation to play leapfrog with a unicorn, work turning into play and vice versa, a showdown between the reptile brain and mammalian brain, a chance to bob for lollipops in a fountain, a thunderstorm coming just in time to douse a raging fire, samurais wearing pajamas, a supernatural ham sandwich, and opportunities to tinker with your "Me Against the World" attitude.

Has a baby ever been born with two umbilical cords? If so, he or she would be a good symbol for you in the coming weeks. Why? Because you should be extremely aggressive about getting the nurturing you need--even to the point of double-dipping from a primal source. In my astrological opinion, it's your responsibility to make sure you're flooded with blessings. Trust your unprecedented hunger.

Kathleen Raine (1908-2003) was a brilliant Cambridge-educated scholar and poet who won numerous awards for her poetry in the U.K. and France. Many of her colleagues were towering intellectuals, but she herself wanted "to get away from the Sherlock Holmes misconception that everything has a rational explanation." She gravitated instead toward "the sacred springs of life, which are the imagination and the heart." She's your role model right now, Gemini. I hope she'll inspire you to apply all of your high-powered ingenuity to an exploration of soul-awakening mysteries that can't be encapsulated with neat analyses. It's a perfect moment for you to celebrate the indescribable bounty of fertile chaos.

Are there influences that render you numb or even dumb? What experiences tend to shut you down? When you're gliding along in your natural rhythm, are you sometimes interrupted by blips that make you feel lost and unresponsive? According to my reading of the astrological omens, Cancerian, you now have extra power to fight back against these little outbreaks of black magic. It's a perfect moment to get the upper hand on anything that closes you off from the world or locks you away from your own intuition.

The Hebrew word "shalom" is both a hello infused with a goodbye and a goodbye leavened with a hello. That's why it would be wise and fun for you to make it your word of power in the coming days. You'll be spinning through a transitional zone in which it won't always be clear which direction is up. You'll be coming and going simultaneously, embarking on new journeys and ending old ones. Whenever you say "shalom," whether it's a greeting to someone else or a mantra uttered in solitude, you'll remind yourself that the threshold you're in is pregnant with a thousand possibilities.

Some scientists believe our brains are in a continual state of war. Writing in LiveScience.com, Bjorn Carey reports that our grey matter is a battleground where competing thoughts and impulses struggle for supremacy, brawling and jousting for our undivided attention. I have reason to believe that this ruckus will be far more pronounced than usual for you in the coming weeks, Virgo. All of your pairs of opposites will intensify their conflict, with each side clamoring and maneuvering to be declared winner. What I recommend may surprise you. I think you should just sit back with amused tolerance and let them fight it out. There really is no pressing need for you to be anything other than a radiant bundle of fascinating contradictions.

I'm not a big fan of excessive decorum. That's why I'm opposed to the efforts by some professional tennis officials to stop the spread of grunting among female tennis players. The great Monica Seles started the trend some years ago, emitting war cries as she struck the ball, and since then many other players have made it a part of their game. This is a favorable time for you to experiment with what they have discovered: that making loud mouth noises loosens your inhibitions, boosts your confidence, and lubricates your power. Liberate your GRUNT, Libra!

In preparation for my public readings and performances, I often ask my hosts to make sure that there are pussy willows and pomegranates placed near the podium, along with a pint of absinthe, a jump rope woven from hemp for use in my interactive rituals, and a box of slave-free, non-GMO, organic vegan chocolates. What about you, Scorpio? What items would you demand in your rider if you were asked to speak about your philosophy of life to a curious audience? It's an ideal time to meditate on this matter. According to my astrological analysis, you will soon be in the spotlight, will be encouraged to spread your influence more forcefully, and will have openings to ask for what you want with aggressive clarity.

Austin artist Scott Wade likes to let layers of dust collect on the rear window of his car. That allows him to express his specialty: detailed "paintings" carved out of the dust with his fingers and paintbrushes. The most exquisite of his temporary masterpieces was a black-and-white reproduction of one of the famous "Dogs Playing Poker" paintings. I recommend you make Wade your role model, Sagittarius. Create unexpected wonders and exuberant curiosities out of stuff that's used in a different way than it's "supposed" to be.

I recently found out there's a famous guy out there with a name similar to mine. Rob Brzezinski is an administrator for pro football's Minnesota Vikings. He's regarded as a "cap guru," meaning he's highly skilled at manipulating the National Football League's Byzantine "cap" system of rules about how much money a team can spend on its players. That's pretty funny given the fact that I've been working really hard in the last few months to become a "Cappy guru," by which I mean someone who understands Capricorns really well. I mention this because it's prime time for you to seek out and learn from people who are to you what Rob Brzezinski is to me: your counterpart, soul twin, shadow, doppelganger, or other half.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Imagine asking fundamentalist nutcase Jerry Falwell to evaluate a book about evolution by a renowned science writer like Richard Dawkins. Imagine handing poet Allen Ginsberg's masterwork Howl to a janitor in Bangladesh and paying him to write his opinions about it. The effect would be similar to an event that actually occurred recently. The New York Times invited ex-Marine sniper Anthony Swofford, author of the Gulf War memoir Jarhead, to review a subversive metaphysical experiment penned by visionary philosopher Daniel Pinchbeck. As you might expect, Swofford's screed was 85 percent hallucination. Let the Times' gaffe serve as a warning beacon, Aquarius. It's now crucial for you to gather a range of discriminating opinions about yourself and the possibilities you're considering. Don't rely on people who have no familiarity with, understanding of, or respect for the issues you want feedback about.

Neurologist Oliver Sacks writes books in which he describes the ingenious adaptations some of his patients have made when faced with limitations that other people might have found debilitating. One example is an artist whose car accident caused him to lose his ability to see any other colors besides black and white. In response, he became a specialist in creating black and white paintings, and ultimately developed a mastery that won him acclaim. Later, when offered a chance to undergo treatment to restore the full spectrum of vision, he declined. Take heart from his story, Pisces. The coming weeks will be an excellent time for you, too, to capitalize on one of your seeming liabilities or inadequacies.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Yawning often occurs during the time we're transitioning from a passive state to a more active one, like when we're waking up in the morning or when we've decided to stop watching TV, get up off the couch, and head out for a jog. Psychology professor Robert Provine, an expert on the subject, says that concert pianists and Olympic athletes typically yawn as they gear up for their moments in the limelight. Judging from these facts, Aries, I imagine you'll soon be indulging in more yawns than usual. You're about to go from a phase of relative inertness to one of mind-jiggling adventure.

Three years before Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code came out, my book The Televisionary Oracle was published. In it, I riffed extensively on Mary Magdalene's role as Jesus's consort, collaborator, and co-creator of Christianity--similar in ways to Brown's themes. Sales of my tome are approaching 10,000, while Brown's have topped 61 million. Why the contrast? His work is a linear detective story, while mine is an experimental blend of magical realism, prophetic philosophy, and oracular poetry. His characterizations and plot hew to established conventions of mainstream fiction, while mine spring from my muse and real life. The difference between our approaches is comparable to the choice you have ahead of you, Aries. You can opt for greater popularity and loyalty to convention, or you can choose to be more of a secret as you rigorously follow the promptings of your inner voice.

A Malaysian woman survived a showdown with a tiger. Kaliyama was working as a rubber tapper when the big cat slinked up behind her and wrapped its jaws around her leg. "Amma! Amma!" she cried out, invoking the name of the mother goddess. The tiger let go, backed off a step, and glared at her. Summoning her courage, she gazed back at it. After a few minutes of this staring match, the tiger departed, leaving Kaliyama in peace. I advise you to use a similar approach in your engagement with a beastly influence, Aries. Ask for the goddess's help, then let your essence beam out through the windows to your soul.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

During America's Civil War, John Bell Hood was a top general for the Confederacy. Though initially impressive, he grew increasingly ineffectual as his ferocious courage devolved into maniacal force devoid of strategy. His superior officer Robert E. Lee said that Hood was "all lion and no fox." I mention this, Aries, in the hope that it will serve as a kick in the butt. You're not as unbalanced as Hood--your ratio is about 90 percent lion, 10 percent fox--but if you want to navigate your way successfully through the coming weeks, you'll have to work harder on cultivating your inner fox.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

According to a study done by sociologist Werner Habermehl at the Hamburg Medical Research Institute, sex makes you smarter. His test subjects showed greater skill at performing certain mental tasks after they made love. Habermehl attributes the results to the increased levels of adrenaline and cortisol that are released in the body. I encourage you to do some experiments of your own, Taurus. The coming weeks will be an excellent time for you to engage in all manner of experiences that might boost your intelligence, including (though not limited to) regular erotic adventures.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Using your common sense, you might assume you could swim faster through water than through syrup. But research published by Professor Edward Cussler has shown that's not true. In his paper "Will Humans Swim Faster or Slower in Syrup?", he proved that the breaststroke can be done with equal speed in both mediums. Keep that in mind, Gemini. Your surroundings may sometimes feel dense in the coming weeks--more like syrup than water. But as long as you don't buy into the fear that life will be more difficult and slow-going, you'll be able to glide along with just as much grace as you've enjoyed recently.

Since it's my birthday this week, I decided to take a break from business as usual. That's why I outsourced the writing of our Cancerian horoscope to an astrologer in Bangladesh, Farhana Rasel. Here's what she came up with: It is an auspicious time to use the good will you have accumulated through your generous deeds. You should ask for favors from people who have enjoyed your favors, and coast along on the currents of the good karma you have set in motion. Luck will be on your side if you permit yourself an excursion into the naughty mysteries of enlightened narcissism. You will be given more slack than usual, especially if you have the nerve to demand it.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"Prescribed Burn Season Begins" read a headline in a Colorado newspaper that publishes my column. The report said that forestry officials planned to intentionally set easily-controllable fires on parcels of bone-dry woods. By reducing the density of potential fuel, they would dramatically reduce the threat of massive forest fires in the future. The burns would also make habitats more livable for wildlife. I suggest you make this your metaphor, Leo. If you burn a little now, you'll prevent a bigger burn later.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Futurologist David Brin talks to a diverse range of scientists. Over the years, he has noticed that many of them have become "much livelier, more open-minded, and more interested in fields outside their own" than they were when he first met them. Physicists are more interested in biology, biologists in astronomy, and engineers in cybernetics. According to my reading of the astrological omens, Virgo, this is a perfect moment for you to have this kind of fun. You will attract unexpected benefits into your life if you wander outside your areas of specialty and check out the action in other genres. It's high time for exuberant cross-pollination.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

If you think you need to be fixed, toned down, made over, or recreated from scratch, you're reading the wrong horoscope column. Likewise, if you imagine that you're a wounded animal in desperate need of rescue or a helpless victim cowering in your closet, I'm not the proper consultant for you. But if you long to be fiercely understood, shaken awake, and dared to discover your higher calling, you've come to the right place. Now let's get started on the next phase of my pet project, which is to inspire you to deal with what philosopher Alan Watts called "the taboo against knowing who you are." There are secrets that your unconscious mind has been longing to reveal to your conscious mind, and conditions are now favorable for that shocking yet pleasurable communication to unfold.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In the course of my life, I've known five people whom I consider feral. They weren't raised by wolves in the wild, but they have qualities that make it seem as if they could have been. They regularly get wild glints in their eyes, and are given to sudden expulsions of anomalous noises that express manic amusement mixed with inscrutable emotions. They can survive while traveling in foreign lands despite having little money, and even when they're home they're prone to taking long rambles in the middle of the night. They couldn't care less what anyone thinks of them, and rarely do what anyone expects them to do. These feral folks are disruptive but not dangerous, and they confound my beliefs about human nature in the most entertaining ways. Even if you don't fit this description, Scorpio, you'd be wise to flirt with your own brand of feral behavior in the coming weeks. It's time to untame yourself.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

The successful Czech composer Vaclav Halek has an unusual muse: the mushroom kingdom. No, he doesn't ingest the psychedelic varieties and write music while high. Rather, he wanders out into the forest, lies down next to fungal colonies, and tunes in to their vibrations. "I simply record music that the mushrooms sing to me," he told The Sydney Morning Herald. Trees and rocks also produce melodies, he reports, but the toadstools' compositions are the finest. Given the fact that you're in a phase when becoming a better listener would improve your life dramatically, Sagittarius, I encourage you to be open-minded about Halek's approach to his creativity. Just imagine that you have the power to eavesdrop on all of creation.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"What the heart knows today the head will understand tomorrow," wrote Irish storyteller James Stephens. It's lucky for you that this is true, Capricorn--or at least it will be lucky if you're smart enough to trust your heart, which has already figured out a certain truth that your head is still days away from registering. This is not merely a pretty metaphor, by the way. Despite what you may have been led to believe about the nature of the heart, it is actually an organ of intelligence that is capable of deep thought.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

During an outdoor concert, '80s pop star Cyndi Lauper experienced a rare event that every singer dreads. As she belted out a long, booming note, a bird flying overhead dispensed a blob that zoomed into her wide-open mouth. Lauper's grandmother later assured her that this was a stroke of good luck, and the singer herself referred to it as "God's little joke." I predict you will soon enjoy a metaphorically similar visitation.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you're about to turn into a creative powerhouse--and will remain so for at least a few weeks. That means you'll be at the peak of your ability to conjure up artistic masterpieces. But more than that: You will also have uncanny skill at whipping up fresh, crisp solutions to conundrums that have stymied you and your tribe for a long time. It will almost be as if you have found a way to tap into the future, where you can learn novel ways of seeing that are impossible to access in the present.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You will have valid reasons for unleashing vigorous critiques in the coming week. For best results, however, I suggest that you dress them up in fine language. Your complaints will be more likely to have a cathartic effect if you make them witty and even a bit florid. To get in the right mood, spend some time with the Random Shakespeare Insult Generator. Here are a few, all lifted from the work of The Bard. (1) "Thou jarring motley-minded pignut!" (2) "Thou cockered beef-witted measle!" (3) "Thou unmuzzled dismal-dreaming scut!"



How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your intriguing fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. 

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Is the planet running out of oil? Some experts say yes, others say no. Secretly, part of me hopes we are. If forced to use less of the tragically magic fuel, we'd get at least some relief from the ongoing catastrophe of global warming. But the whole discussion may become irrelevant in light of the existence of oil shale. It's a rock that when heated releases the abundant oil hidden within it. Though expensive to access, two trillion barrels of the stuff lie untapped beneath the surface of America's Rocky Mountains. "That's more than all the proven oil reserves of crude oil in the world," reports The Denver Post. This is an apt metaphor for your life, Aries. You may seem to be running out of a resource that has energized you for a long time. The truth is, there's more to be had, but you'll have to work harder to get it.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In all my years of evaluating your astrological omens, I have rarely seen a time so favorably disposed to the value and pleasure of variety. I'm tempted to conclude that the cosmos is conspiring for you to try all 32 flavors, 46 positions, and 64 loopholes. For a limited time only, you really should be determined to sample a little of a lot rather than a lot of a little. Grazing and browsing are not only fine, they're preferable. You have a poetic license to be mercurial, spontaneous, and inscrutable.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Donald Rumsfeld never listens to anything except the voices inside his own head," wrote San Francisco Chronicle columnist Jon Carroll. While this is an unfortunate situation, given the fact that the U.S. Secretary of Defense has so much power over others, it is not all that uncommon. Many people rarely consult any opinions besides those that originate in their own imaginations. And from time to time, all of us get temporarily hypnotized by the rants of the little voices in our heads. You're especially at risk for that to happen in the near future, Aries. There are two things you can do to ensure it doesn't. First, cultivate an ironic distance toward those inner voices. Evaluate what they say with rigorous objectivity. Second, listen really hard to people who are both thoughtful and humble.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the week ahead. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The general consensus is that Americans are getting dumber. A recent study, for instance, reported that more people can name the characters in The Simpsons TV show than know the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. Yet an article by Malcolm Gladwell in The New Yorker notes that Americans' I.Q. scores have been steadily rising for a long time--so much so that a person whose I.Q. placed her in the top ten percent of the population in 1920 would be in the bottom third today. One possible explanation: Our "growing stupidity" may better be described as a difficulty keeping up with the ever-growing mass of facts, whereas we're actually becoming better at solving problems. That's a key issue in my advice to you, Aries. You're in a phase that's favorable for upgrading your intelligence--by which I mean improving your problem-solving skills, not accumulating more facts.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I did something today that's an apt metaphor for the task you have ahead of you. While driving my 1997 Honda Accord on the streets of San Francisco, I had to drive very slowly and gradually while ascending a steep hill. I kept my foot on the gas pedal just hard enough to keep the vehicle from sliding backward as I inched upward at two miles per hour. It was an exercise in supreme concentration: I had to be delicate and focused while prodding a one and a half ton beast. Just as I pulled off this feat, Aries, I believe you'll be able to accomplish a comparable version of it.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Any idiot can face a crisis," said Russian writer Anton Chekhov. "It is the day-to-day living that wears you out." Your main assignment in the coming weeks, Aries, will be to use your ingenuity to keep from being burned out by the subtle and minor trials of the daily grind. It won't be as dramatic a challenge as some of the epic travails you dealt with in March, but in my opinion it will be just as heroic. 



Where do you want to go in the coming week? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the week ahead. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Let's put your salary in perspective. If you earn more than $2,182 per year, you're wealthier than 85 percent of the world's population. That's according to www.GlobalRichList.com. Even though you're pretty well-off, however, I'm going to dare you to ask for more. It's the perfect astrological phase to do so. The omens suggest that you will attract benefactors and drum up cosmic support if you make even a half-assed attempt to get richer quicker. Homework: Write down three things you could do to raise your income.



Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the week ahead. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"When the only tool you have is a hammer," said psychologist Abraham Maslow, "you tend to treat everything as if it were a nail." Since it will be crucial for you not to regard everything as if it were a nail in the coming weeks, Aries, I suggest you make sure your toolbox is filled with screwdrivers, wrenches, drills, crowbars, and chisels, as well as hammers. If you want to nudge your craftsmanship even further outside of the box, you might also want to expand your definition of what a tool is. Remember that old TV show MacGyver? The hero used a paper clip to short-circuit the launch of a missile and a candy bar to plug up a leak of corrosive acid.



What blessings will life bring you in the coming week? What challenges will you be invited to dive into? To explore the ripening trends further, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the week ahead. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When I was a kid, I read Highlights magazine. My favorite feature was the section that asked Zen-like questions like "Can you laugh and cry at the same time?" or "If you were a talking parrot, what words would you want to learn?" For this week's horoscope, I've borrowed the spirit of that old source of inspiration. May the following passage incite your raw wonder and feral innocence. What's more beautiful, the smell of an orange or the sight of a green hill in spring? Under what circumstances might you eat dessert before the main course? Have you ever seen a statue wink? Is it possible to fall up instead of down? Describe how you'd catch a dragonfly without hurting it. Tell a story that's half-true and half-lies. Can you grow brain cells just by thinking you want to?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you live to be 90 years old, you will have spent a total of eight months sitting in your car stopped at red lights. In addition, you will have wasted ten months standing in lines at stores, banks, and government agencies, and you will have lost almost two years killing time while hoping that a certain phone call, letter, or email will arrive. That's the bad news, Aries. The good news is that few of those agonizing pauses will be racked up in the near future. This is one time when "no waiting" is the rule. You could make three months' progress in 15 days.



Want more help in exploring the Great Mystery that is your life? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the week ahead. 


Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It would be a great time to launch several new ventures all at once, even if it means abandoning an old project you've been working on for months. APRIL FOOL! Don't you dare do what I just suggested. The future won't thrive unless you lavish the past with the gift of your careful attention. Please please please put the finishing touches on a labor of love you've been working on for months--and then start new projects.

Seventh grader Michael Kawa's poem is about the official face he shows the world. "My mask helps me when I am scared and when I am embarrassed," he writes. "My mask tells me to act like someone else when I want to act like myself. My mask tells me I should go on the Big Dipper roller coaster when I really want to go on the little rides. My mask hides me from girls and fights. My mask hides my mad mind." Now I invite you to write about your own mask, Aries. It's the perfect time to take inventory of your persona--the official face you show the world--and to make changes to get it into closer alignment with the person you actually are in your depths.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The Season of Dreams begins now. While you're sleeping, you'll be working harder than usual as you dive deeper into your subconscious mind in quest of mythic stories that can transform your waking life. Here's a list of some of the dream themes you might encounter, along with possible interpretations. Dreams of the circus coming to town mean that maybe you should indulge a barely acknowledged need to do something that seems out of character. Dreams of having a picnic in a tree house may mean you'd benefit from not having your feet planted so firmly on the ground.  Dreams of doing something unethical that makes everyone mad mean that you should explore ethical, constructive ways to express your rebellious urges. Dreams of fighting a king or queen who stole money from you might mean you should fight back against an authority that ripped you off.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

If you're doing work you love, Gemini, your prestige will rise in the next six months. If you're doing work you merely tolerate, you'll experience a sharp increase in inspirations about how to remedy the situation. In the event that you actually hate your current form of employment, I believe you'll face a crisis that will force you to either quit or negotiate significant changes. But whether your gig suits you pretty well or not so much, I encourage you to start whipping up some magic that will move you closer to your dream job.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Many of us who were born under the sign of Cancer have always felt trepidation about the fact that we're stuck with the same name as a disease. A while back I asked my readers to suggest alternate possibilities. One of the best ideas came from amateur astronomer Michael Bird. He said that within the constellation of Cancer the Crab there is a batch of 350 close-knit stars that are collectively known as the Beehive Cluster, and also as Praesepe, which is the Latin word for "manger." Either "Beehive" or "Manger" would serve our tribe well in the coming weeks. The astrological omens say it's time to give birth to and nurture a new brainchild, preferably with the support of an organized hive of our busy, buzzing allies.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Even if you don't literally take a journey to a distant place in the coming weeks, you will nevertheless be like a stranger in a strange land. I suggest that you adopt an attitude similar to that of an explorer. Here's a list of traveling instructions from Patrick Harpur, author of The Philosophers' Secret Fire: A History of the Imagination. "Don't believe everything you have been told, either for good or ill. Observe local customs; respect local gods. Talk less than you listen. Don't expect the inhabitants to speak your language; rather, try and speak theirs. Try to see as well as sightsee. Be polite but firm; take advice but do not be gullible. If in doubt, smile. Do not laugh at the natives, but do not be afraid to laugh. Do not be superior or aloof, but don't try to dress like a native. Don't join in the dancing unless you have learned the steps."

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The paradoxes are coming! The paradoxes are coming! It won't be enough merely to solve a few amusing brainteasers. You'll have to find a way to feel perfectly fine as you get squeezed by industrial-strength contradictions that might make a less intelligent person feel crazy. Can you do it? Is it possible for you to remain poised and magnanimous in the face of the pressure to think impossible thoughts and feel indescribable feelings? Can you see how all three sides of every story are equally valid? The potential rewards are substantial: a crispy epiphany, a funky treasure, and the equivalent of a "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

If you own a Jaguar luxury automobile, it's an excellent time to redo the leather interior. If you live in a trailer park on the other side of the railroad tracks, the moment is right to cover up the faux wood paneling with fancy wallpaper. And if you don't fall into either of those categories, meditate on how you might redecorate the inside of your world, from the physical environments you frequent to the interior walls of your imagination.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

I wear my hair long, like Benjamin Franklin, Isaac Newton, Jesus Christ, and the majority of the men who have lived in the Western world during the last two millennia. So even though I'm at odds with the cultural trends of the last 100 years, I'm right in alignment with more enduring ideas about masculine fashion. Try something similar, Scorpio: Meditate on how it might benefit you to get out of sync with prevailing attitudes about what's right and good and true and cool, and instead be in style with more timeless and abiding modes.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"Neoteny" is a biological term that means the retention of juvenile characteristics into adulthood. For instance, certain small dogs with big eyes and shortened muzzles have a resemblance to puppies even after they're full-grown. Most of us humans have personality characteristics that are for all intents and purposes neotenous. They're throwbacks that may make us appear cute and cuddly, but that on the other hand keep us in a state of arrested development. It's prime time to ask yourself if you have qualities like that, Sagittarius. If so, do you really want to keep cultivating them?

It's the Introspection Season, Capricorn. I encourage you to write copiously in a journal. Here are several themes that would be fruitful to explore: (1) Your most amazing qualities and your worst qualities. (2) The hundred things you want to accomplish in the next 30 years. (3) Your bitter complaints, horrendous pain, and lost dreams. (4) Everything you love and everything that's beautiful and everything that works.  In addition to writing your heart out and your ass off, paste in cut-out pictures from magazines, draw pictures, and ask friends to write messages to you.

Once the software and brain implants are developed, we'll all be able to benefit from the kind of instant education that was at the disposal of the dissident heroes of the three films collectively known as The Matrix. Want to learn how to pilot a helicopter? The entire skill set will be downloaded into you in a few minutes. Planning a journey to Tanzania? You'll become a fluent speaker of Swahili in time for your departure. The technology is still years away, Aquarius, but in the coming weeks you'll be able to enjoy the closest current approximation to it. You've entered the super-learning season.

"I don't know why we are here," wrote philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, "but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves." His feelings contrast sharply with that of the poet Robert Bly, who edited a book of sacred poems entitled The Soul Is Here for Its Own Joy. Which of these two approaches are you inclined to follow, Pisces? I believe you're at a crossroads: The direction you choose to endorse and emphasize now will shape your destiny for a long time.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your horoscope this week comes to you courtesy of the ancient Chinese book of oracles, the I Ching, translated by Richard Wilhelm. The title of your reading is "Liberation." Here's the heart of it: "In times of standstill it will happen that inferior people attach themselves to you and even seem to grow indispensable. But when the time of deliverance draws near, with its call to action, you must free yourself from such chance acquaintances with whom you have no inner connections. For otherwise the friends who share your views, on whom you could rely and together with whom you could accomplish great things, mistrust you and stay away."

Sorry the column was posted so late this week. I've been having technical difficulties with my website.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

I predict that animals will be especially attracted to you in the coming days. The light of the sun will seem to possess an uncanny fluidity and sparkle. You may experience vivid fantasies like seeing a talking cat in a tree or hearing advice coming from a soap dispenser. Strangers may gaze at you for no apparent reason, and even your friends will have unusual feelings for you. You may be reunited with precious memories that have been lost to you for a long time. In the consciousness industry, we call this natural magic time.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"I am a fugitive from the law of averages," writes Sage Price, one of my Gemini readers. "I swore a long time ago that I would never be taken alive by anything that was average, commonplace, standard, or ordinary." His attitude is especially recommended for you right now. In order to harvest the potential rewards the cosmos has prepared for you, you've got to push to excel; you've got to cultivate a lust to be unique; you've even got to be willing to risk making other people envious of you. One of the worst sins you could commit would be half-assed mediocrity.

Siam's King Mongut had a harem of 9,000 women. On his deathbed, however, before succumbing to the ravages of syphilis, he confessed that he was truly in love with only 700 of his lovers--less than eight percent of the total. Why he didn't concentrate on that eight percent and forget the rest we'll never know. Don't make a similar mistake in the coming months, Cancerian. You will have the chance to indulge in a great variety of pleasurable adventures, but only a fraction will have the potential of nourishing your soul.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

What's the best way to defeat a dragon? Some fairy tales propose the use of brute force, while others suggest that the protection of a magical amulet is preferable. Still other myths say the optimum strategy is to use stealth to avoid the dragon completely, though that usually means living in constant fear of the beast. From what I can tell, Leo, your future happiness will be best served if you use none of the above, but instead employ one of the two little-known methods of dragon-taming: either ask it sly riddles to confuse it or else pacify it through the entertaining power of your songs and dances.

"We have art so that we may not die of reality," said Friedrich Nietzsche. While I'm sure you won't literally be killed off by reality this week, it could bore you half to death--unless you aggressively subject yourself to massive amounts of really fine art. I'm not just talking about listening to formulaic pop music or getting a glimpse of the Mona Lisa on an ad for the upcoming film The Da Vinci Code. I'm referring to intensive exposure to inspired painting, sculpture, music, architecture, dance, and literature--sublime forms of creative expression that you may have to work hard to find.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

To be of real service to you, I have to do more than be simplistically optimistic. It's important for me to be your cheerleader, counterbalancing the negative reinforcement that so often comes your way, but it would be irresponsible of me to inflate you with false hopes. This week, for instance, I have to report that there's a 65 percent chance of you achieving a major breakthrough in at least one of your relationships, but only if you lose every ounce of self-pity and refuse to blame anyone for your sorrows. I also foresee the possibility of you healing 55 percent of one of your old wounds, but only if you stretch yourself to learn a new lesson from the original trauma.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

A few years ago, executives at a major record company signed my band to their label. They loved us. We were the next big thing. Or at least that's what they told us up until the moment when they demanded that we change the titles and lyrics to some of our songs. They were afraid that the cigarette company Philip Morris would sue us for our song "Marlboro Man Jr." and that Kmart would sue us for our song "Kmart Tribal Ballet." We agreed to make the changes only because we had no choice: If we refused, our music would have never been heard. The company owned the rights to it. Let this serve as an example of what not to do in the coming weeks, Scorpio. Do all the research and strategic long-range thinking necessary to avoid getting into a position where people you don't know very well control your fate.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

It's a good time to reconnect with your childhood memories--especially the good ones that made your heart sing. You will derive great practical benefits from remembering specific scenes that embodied the essence of who you were back in the beginning. Was there a time you read an exciting book under the covers with a flashlight way past your bedtime? Or waded in the creek searching for a fantastic treasure some big kid told you about? I hope you give yourself the rare pleasure of reliving those events, trusting that they'll provide you with the exact emotional lift you need.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

This would be an excellent week to tilt all the paintings on the walls of your home so they're hanging a bit crooked, refer to yourself as the "Wizard of Desserts," and stand in a mud puddle up to your ankles. I suggest that you further take advantage of the astrological opportunities by using a felt-tip pen to draw tattoos of magic symbols on your body, making love with grocery bags over your heads, and reciting dirty limericks in front of people who think you're too serious. It's high time for you to lose your cool.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Metaphorically speaking, you will duck at just the right time to miss the cream pie that's headed toward your face. At least that's what I predict, Aquarius. In addition to your good timing and skill at protecting yourself, you will also have a knack for avoiding messy complications, which is lucky given the fact that people around you may act as if messy complications are fun and interesting. Here's further good news: You will have an instinct for detecting the slivers of truth that are embedded in wads of total BS. That will allow you to act with lucid efficiency while others are out fighting non-existent demons.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

One day 17 years ago I was lying alone on my acupuncturist's table, floating in that hypnogogic state you sometimes slip into when your ears, wrists, feet, and forehead are pierced with needles. At one point she came in to check on me. Patting me on the upper arm, she murmured, "You will live a long life." I received it as a prophecy, as a gift from her intuition to mine.  In the days and months that followed, it stripped away the habitual anxiety I carried around with me and freed me to live with more courage and abandon. It gave me license to believe more wildly in my own potential. Now I'm offering you the same gift, Pisces. If you're reading this horoscope today, you will live a long life.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Dung beetles were considered sacred and lucky by the ancient Egyptians. In fact, the seemingly lowly insect, also known as a scarab, was worshiped as a symbol of transformation and resurrection, in part because it derives its nourishment from the waste matter of other animals. Since it also pushes balls of dung to its nest, it was thought to resemble the god Ra rolling the sun through the heavens. During the coming week, Aries, the scarab will be your power animal. May it inspire you to turn crap into treasure as you're reborn from the deadness of the past.

It took an English woman named Venida Crabtree 33 years to learn how to drive. She failed her first driving test at age 17, but never gave up trying. Last year she finally succeeded, getting her first license at the age of 50. She's your role model, Taurus. There's a good chance that like her, you will soon be able to master a task or reach a goal that you've been plugging away at forever.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I'm here at San Francisco's Samovar Tea Lounge to meditate on your horoscope. I've decided that the beverage most likely to put me in the right mood is "Monkey-Picked Iron Goddess of Mercy" tea. That's because my analysis of your astrological omens reveals that there'll be something both steely and soft about your immediate future, both willful and delicate. "Iron Goddess of Mercy" is an apt metaphor for the influences you should seek. Furthermore, I suspect you'll need the intervention of an agile and vibrant animal energy, which is suggested by the "Monkey-Picked" aspect of the tea. Using the Samovar menu as a divinatory tool for generating even more oracular information, I've come up with three additional phrases to capture the quality of your life in the coming days: velvety nuances of roasted chestnuts and eucalyptus; tastes that are zealously smoky yet gossamer and satiny; and not for the sinless.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

As a Cancerian, you're sometimes prone to indulging in pathological levels of self-sufficiency. You can get into the bad habit of making it hard for people to give you emotional support, constructive feedback, and plain old ordinary gifts. That's why I hesitate to say anything that might encourage you to get into a woe-is-me, I-have-to-do-everything-myself mode of heroic martyrdom. Nevertheless, I've decided to take that risk. To achieve the breakthrough that's now available, you may have to take what Ernest Hemingway described as the path to greatness: Push yourself "far out past where you can go, out to where no one can help you."

Leo (July 23-August 22)

This would be an excellent time for you to create your own personal religion, complete with rituals, prayers, and divinities that fit your precise needs. Feel free to borrow extensively from various spiritual traditions, of course, but make sure you give each belief or practice your own unique twist. And please include a few idiosyncratic touches that have never before been a part of any organized faith, like a holy day commemorating your first sexual experience or a sacred object obtained from a toy store or pawn shop or a rousing hymn adopted from an old Nirvana song.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The ancient Greeks had words for love that transcend our usual notions, writes Lindsay Swope in her review of Richard Idemon's book Through the Looking Glass. Epithemia is the basic need to touch and be touched. Our closest approximation is "horniness," though epithemia is not so much a sexual feeling as a sensual one. Philia is friendship. It includes the need to admire and respect your friends as a reflection of yourself--like in high school, where you want to hang out with the cool kids because that means you're cool too. Eros isn't sexual in the way we usually think, but is more about the emotional gratification that comes from merging souls. Agape is a mature, utterly free expression of love that has no possessiveness. It means wanting the best for another person even if it doesn't advance one's self-interest. The phase you're currently in, Virgo, is providing you with opportunities to explore the frontiers of at least three of these kinds of love.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

America's finest news source, the newspaper and website known as The Onion (www.TheOnion.com), reported recently that President George W. Bush has hidden the nation's report card in his sock drawer. Having received a D in international relations, a D in economics, and an F in military history, the Commander in Chief was too embarrassed to share the evaluation with anyone. I implore you to *not* be like him in the coming week, Libra. It may be hard to imagine, but you will generate good luck and healthy relationships if you freely admit your mistakes and shortcomings. This is one time when power can come from revealing your vulnerabilities.

At its best, a study of astrology illuminates your choices and leaves the choosing up to you. It helps you understand that your fate is never set in stone, but is always susceptible to the command of your free will. In that spirit, I've got a quiz for you to take. Here are four pairs of equally possible outcomes. Meditate on each pair, and decide which you'd prefer to induce in the coming week: (1) simmering happiness versus crazed longing; (2) love packed with chewy riddles versus infatuation that only temporarily frees you; (3) practical enthusiasm versus dizzying highs; (4) slow, epic bursts of subtle progress versus out-of-this-world fantasies.

On March 11 a Malaysian snake charmer will attempt to break the world record for kissing a poisonous serpent. Shahimi Abdul Hamid has in the past managed to survive while smooching a huge cobra 21 times, but this time he hopes to go further, exceeding the previous all-time high of 30. I don't know his astrological sign, but if he's a Sagittarius he has the best chance of succeeding. You Centaurs are at the peak of your ability to mix tenderness and intimacy with high adventure.

A reader named Christy McMunn wrote to tell me that she'll be running for president of the U.S. in 2016. She promises that she will ruthlessly express the raw, naked facts, whatever the consequences may be. Her motto: "If you cannot handle the truth, be careful of what you ask." I urge you to make that your modus operandi in the coming weeks, Capricorn. Be a greedy hunter in quest of the genuine story, the inside dope, and the piercing revelation. In preparation, strip yourself of any belief that might interfere with your receptivity to and enjoyment of the raw, naked facts.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

After taking inventory of the astrological factors coming to bear on you the past eight years, I've decided you're ready to leap to the next octave of your evolution. Therefore, I'll tell you a truth that was articulated by the powerful activist Mahatma Gandhi. It was instrumental in his success at leading millions of Indians to overthrow British oppression. I hope that his demanding, controversial advice will play a central role in shaping your destiny for the next eight years. But beware: It will only work if you're a brave rebel who relentlessly resists the conventional wisdom. Gandhi: "Every moment of your life is infinitely creative and the universe is endlessly bountiful. Just put forth a clear enough request, and everything your heart desires must come to you."

I've been present during the births of two children, Jasmine and Zoe. Both experiences were daunting, explosive, and ecstatic. Nothing else that has ever happened to me has rivaled the role they played in awakening my reverence for life. The gratitude and love that overflowed in me then will always remain a source of inspiration. If you choose to respond to the invitations the cosmos is now making available to you, Pisces, you will soon be visited by events that evoke comparable feelings.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

After viewing Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1662, diarist Samuel Pepys called it "the most stupid, ridiculous play I ever saw in my life." French philosopher Voltaire had an equally dim view of Shakespeare's Hamlet. "One would imagine this piece to be the work of a drunken savage," he wrote in 1768. Pepys' and Voltaire's opinions of the Bard ultimately became a minority view, of course. Many modern analysts regard his work as among the best in English literature. In the coming months, I predict there will be a similar evolution in the consensus about certain events of your own past. Both you and others will come to think highly of things once considered worthless or aberrant. Redemption begins now.

To celebrate this royal phase of your astrological cycle, I would love to create a "Master of the Universe" crown for you to wear, at least in your imagination. Since I'd like it to conform to your exact needs and specifications, I'm soliciting your input. Please visualize in great detail the kind of regal headpiece you want, then communicate a vision of it to me telepathically. When it's done, I will set it on your head in a dream, and ask you to not take it off for five days and five nights.

On the other hand, I do recommend that you engage in actions like the following: giving theater tickets to a homeless vagabond; doing a day-long impersonation of the person you want to become; tapping into your talent for healing mischief as you comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable; buying yourself a gift that will compel you to stretch your capacities; doing a storytelling performance for the people at an old folks' home; climbing a tree and singing songs that inspire you to move more rapidly toward the future.

It's official. The National Climatic Data Center has confirmed that the weather went crazy in the U.S. last year. From Fresno's 21 consecutive days of 100-degree temperatures to record rainfall in Las Vegas, Wichita, and Pensacola, extreme conditions became commonplace. For you, Cancerian, the coming weeks will have a certain metaphorical resemblance to last year's profusion of weather anomalies. For instance, you can expect events that are akin to hailstorms from sunny skies and triple rainbows at dawn. But that won't be a problem as long as you vow to be intrigued and entertained, not thrown off course, by the interesting outbreaks of wild phenomena.

Once you know, take a pledge to put that desire at the center of your life.

It will be a rather animalistic week, Virgo--or at least it should be. I suggest that you learn to feel more trust in your primal instincts; find out more about the part of you that doesn't use words. If you've got the luxury to experiment, see what it's like when you give your inner beast permission to express all of its creativity. The coming days will also be prime time to befriend lone wolves, horse around with wise old owls, welcome back lost sheep, play possum with jackasses, and flirt with sacred cows.

Indian director T. Rajeevnath is in the early stages of planning his 11th film. It will be a story about Nobel Peace Prize-winner Mother Teresa. Among the small group of actresses he's considering to play the title role is none other than the American celebrity Paris Hilton. Apparently Rajeevnath can sense something in Hilton that is invisible to many of the rest of us. I urge you to be like him in the coming days. Be on the lookout to find value in things that no one else esteems. Find the hidden beauty that everybody has missed. Hunt for riches in the least likely places.

I swear the strange woman standing near me at L.A.'s Getty Museum was having an erotic experience as she gazed upon van Gogh's Irises. She wasn't touching herself, nor was anyone else. But she was apparently experiencing waves of convulsive delight, as suggested by her rapid breathing, shivering muscles, fluttering eyelids, and sweaty forehead. Fifteen minutes later, I saw her again in front of Jean-Honor√© Fragonard's The Fountain of Love. She was only slightly more composed. In a friendly voice, I said, "This stuff really moves you, doesn't it?" "Oh, yeah," she replied, "I've not only learned how to make love with actual flowers and clouds and fountains, I can even make love with paintings of them." Your assignment in the coming weeks, Scorpio, is to take a page from this woman's Kama Sutra: Figure out how to achieve rapturous communion with absolutely everything.

"But we say a thing is holy if it makes you laugh." Let this be a seed thought as you re-evaluate and take inventory of what constitutes holiness for you, Sagittarius. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you will thrive if you spend quality time in sacred space seeking out uncanny experiences that kindle feelings of adoration and awe and amusement.

You will soon experience an upsurge in brainpower--perhaps as much as a 10-point increase in your IQ. I believe the events that heighten your intelligence will involve you doing something brave and resourceful. It's possible, for instance, that you'll dive into a frigid river to save a drowning child or race into a burning building to rescue a beloved animal. Or perhaps your courage will be more subtly expressed: You will offer forgiveness to someone who has wronged or you will speak the difficult but necessary words that everyone has been afraid to articulate.

I'm not necessarily advising you to vent your frustrations by going out after midnight and filling up random strangers' mailboxes with ice cream. Nor do I suggest that you express any of your itchy, inarticulate emotions by using felt-tip markers to scrawl "The people in this place eat kittens" on the wall of an institution that messed with you. Both of those actions might get you arrested, and the proper way to channel your angst is not to do something that sabotages you but rather that elevates and enlightens you. So please figure out an ingenious, constructive way to get your dark yayas out.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Of all the arguments made in favor of getting regular exercise, I rarely hear the one that's most important to me: Do it because it strengthens and tones the power of your will. When you get used to rousing yourself out of your physical inertia, the habit carries over into the mental and spiritual sphere. You find it easier to force yourself out of your comfort zones and push toward the next frontier. You're less likely to procrastinate and accept mediocrity, and you actually enjoy challenging yourself with worthy goals that require strenuous effort. It's now the will-building season for you, Pisces. You know what to do.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"The supple willow tree does not contend against the storm." So says the Shaolin monk advising his young pupil in the old TV show, Kung Fu. Let that be your watchword, Aries. There will be other times when your best interests will be served by digging in, steeling your will, and launching a fierce counteroffensive. But this is not one of those occasions. If you're as supple as the willow, no harm will come to you. In fact, you'll probably end up feeling like you've gotten a very deep, long massage.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The greatest gift you can give right now might be the gift that you yourself were never given. The most valuable service you have to offer your fellow humans may be the service you have always wished were performed for you. An experience that wounded you could and should move you to help people who've been similarly wounded. You now have the power to heal yourself by healing others.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Welcome to your crash course at Happiness School, Gemini. To begin your first lesson, say the following aloud: "In the next 20 days, I will rigorously test the hypothesis that it's possible for me to become far more skilled at creating happiness for myself. During that time, I will do everything within my power to make myself feel good." Now take a piece of paper and write a list of ten familiar experiences that you really enjoy and ten untried experiences that would fill you with well-being if you summoned the courage and initiative to actually attempt them. Finally, Gemini, do at least one of those 20 experiences every day for the next 20 days.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

As of this week, I have written 1,500 astrology columns. Some have been better-written and more useful than others, but I've given my utmost effort to every single one. My style has mutated over the years; the horoscopes I penned in, say, 1994, are so unlike those I write now that they almost seem to be the product of a different author. But then I myself have transformed radically since then, so it makes sense that my work has, too. In fact, my personal development has been fueled by my growth as a writer. I urge you to do what I've just done, fellow Cancerian. Take an inventory of the big tasks you've been doing for years. Evaluate the way they've evolved and how they've shaped your destiny. It's time for an expansive look at the labors of love that have made you who you are.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Japanese farmers have perfected a way to grow square watermelons. At the market the fruit can be stacked with more ease and efficiency, and at home it fits better in the refrigerator. I suggest that you make the square watermelon your metaphor of the week, Leo. What can you do to retrain nature so that it better serves your practical goals? How might you engineer your unruly instinctual urges so as to further your civilized needs?

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In her book Gender Shock, Phyllis Burke notes that as recently as 70 years ago, pink was regarded as a strong, masculine color, and blue as delicate and feminine. This is one of many pieces of evidence she cites to support her argument that definitions of gender arise more from transitory cultural biases rather than biological axioms. If you'd like to align yourself with cosmic rhythms, Virgo, you'll experiment with her hypothesis. Are there ways you've cut yourself off from potential powers because you wrongly assume they're a specialty of the other gender? For instance, if you're a woman, have you been timid about developing your will? If you're a man, have you crippled your ability to be receptive?

Libra (September 23-October 22)

If you have been experiencing some form of injustice, it's an excellent time to stage a protest, strike, or boycott. The astrological omens don't necessarily guarantee you'll get all your demands met, but they do make it likely you'll be able to harness your anger with maximum lucidity. For best results, don't just fight for your own rights, but for the rights of others as well. You should also make sure that in fighting the disrespect you've suffered that you yourself don't disrespect anyone.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"You can't wait for inspiration," proclaimed writer Jack London. "You have to go after it with a club." That sounds too violent to me, though I agree in principle that aggressiveness is the best policy in one's relationship with inspiration--especially for you in the coming weeks. Here's my modified version of London's advice: "Don't wait for inspiration. Go after it with a butterfly net, fishing rod, specimen jars, petri dishes, leashes, sweet treats, juicy bait, persuasive arguments, and sincere flattery." And whatever you do, Scorpio, don't fall into the trap of thinking that inspiration is a rare stroke of luck you're powerless to summon.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"Earth is a school and daily life is our classroom," asserts Dan Millman in his book Living on Purpose. Our teachers aren't always experts and authorities, he says, but often appear in the guise of strangers, acquaintances, children, animals, and unexpected circumstances. The lessons we're asked to master come to us first as simple, straightforward challenges. If we refuse to work at solving them, they take on progressively more difficult and painful forms. Among the most basic of our assignments is the mandate to take good care of our bodies. In my opinion, Sagittarius, that's the most important homework you have in the coming weeks. I hope you'll make dramatic strides in your understanding of what helps your body thrive.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The language we use has a tremendous power to shape our experience. This is especially true for you right now. The words you choose to describe your feelings and adventures will tip the balance of your energy toward delight and vigor or else toward discouragement and apathy. The fewer negative perspectives you formulate, the better your health will be. To spur yourself in the right direction, make frequent use of beautiful words like the following (or create your own list): mellifluous, thrive, melody, luminous, undulate, freshening, reverence, primordial, shimmer.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

There was an indignant uproar after revelations that James Frey's bestselling memoir A Million Little Pieces contains fabrications. Hearing about it prompted me to ruminate on whether there's any such thing as a completely accurate account of any person's life. My conclusion: no. In every autobiography and biography ever written, the author imaginatively strings together selectively chosen details to conjure up artificially coherent narratives rather than depict the crazy-quilt ambiguity that actually characterizes everyone's journey. If you and nine writers set out to tell your life story, you'd produce ten wildly different tales, each rife with subjective interpretation, misplaced emphasis, unintentional distortions, and exorbitant extrapolations from insufficient data. Your assignment this week, Aquarius, is to celebrate the malleability of reality. Regale listeners with stories about the time you worked as a pirate in the Indian Ocean, or rode the rails through Kansas as a hobo, or gave Donald Trump sage advice in an elevator.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Biologist Rupert Sheldrake regularly riles up the scientific establishment with his theories about telepathy and other taboo subjects. After he published his book A New Science of Life, the editor of the prestigious British journal Nature denounced it, saying "This infuriating tract is the best candidate for burning there has been for many years." The same editor later attacked Sheldrake for "heresy," advocating that he be "condemned in exactly the same language that the Pope used to condemn Galileo." I propose that if you're doing your job correctly in the coming weeks, Pisces, you will attract similar protests from the status quo. Fulfilling your mission will require you to wander into territory that's regarded as off-limits by the guardians of the way things have always been done.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In his book And They All Sang, Studs Terkel interviewed jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. "When people say, 'I don't understand your music,'" reported Gillespie, "I say, 'Don't try to understand it, just try to feel it.'" That's excellent advice to keep in mind as you weave your way through the complicated, uncanny, revelatory weeks ahead. Full comprehension of the meaning of this era may not be available until later. But that won't be a problem if you live your life as if it were a song you love.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Dear Dr. Brezsny: I dreamed that an angel who looked like Angelina Jolie was teaching me how to gather energy high in the sky and release it in the form of lightning bolts. It required great upper arm strength because I had to make broad sweeping motions with my arms that gathered the necessary electricity into a vortex that would serve as my launching area. I was exhilarated, though nervous about how much force I had at my disposal. What does my dream mean? -Taurus with Goose Bumps." Dear Taurus: Your dream is a symbol of the situation many Bulls are facing right now. You have enormous energy at your disposal. Here's my advice: Don't use your lightning bolts to intimidate people and institutions that have offended you. Instead, put on a demonstration of strength, impressing everyone--adversaries and allies alike--with your ability to command great power responsibly.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Last Christmas Day, I had dinner at a sushi restaurant in downtown San Rafael, CA. The place was deserted except for a drunk at the bar, me and my two companions, and the table next to us, which was occupied by actors Sean Penn and Robin Wright and their daughter. I thought of going over to compliment Robin on her work in various films and to tell Sean how much I loved his articles in the San Francisco Chronicle about his travels in Iraq, but I decided against it. Don't follow my example in the coming week, Gemini. Express your appreciation to those whose work has inspired you, even at the risk of appearing foolish. It's a perfect moment to explore the emotions of admiration and respect, and to pay homage to your influences.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The mayor of Las Vegas has suggested a novel idea for discouraging graffiti on his city's highway walls. Oscar Goodman envisions televised spectacles in which the vandals' thumbs are cut off. His proposed punishment goes too far for my tastes, but I'm wondering if you might approve of it. Lately you've been having bouts of overreaction, entertaining extreme fantasies in response to circumstances that don't necessarily warrant them. I'm not saying your intense emotions are completely unjustified, Cancerian, nor do I recommend that you repress them. I'm simply asking you to let some time pass before you take action on your feelings.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

An executive at the UK's biggest pharmaceutical company admitted that most prescription medicines aren't very effective. "The vast majority of drugs only work in 30 or 50 per cent of the people," said Allen Roses of GlaxoSmithKline. His explanation: Many patients have idiosyncratic genes that prevent the medicines from functioning as they were designed to. In my opinion, Leo, there's a similar principle at work regarding just about everything that conventional wisdom says is good for you. That's always important to keep in mind, of course, but especially for you right now. More than ever, you'll benefit profoundly from not only questioning authorities and experts, but giving them the third degree.

The elegant, shimmering fabric known as silk is obtained from the cocoon of a worm larva. Typically the cocoon is dunked in boiling water to kill the pupa inside before it can chew its way out. Another precious material with gross origins is ambergris. It's a foul-smelling excrement that sperm whales vomit. After years of exposure to the sun while floating on the ocean, it transforms into an aromatic, waxy substance that's used as a major ingredient in perfume. Silk and ambergris are your personal power symbols in the coming weeks, Virgo. I predict that you'll turn crap into treasure.

"Mirrors should think longer before they reflect," said French filmmaker Jean Cocteau. That's especially true for you this week, Libra. You shouldn't automatically believe every bit of feedback about yourself that comes your way, either from mirrors or any other source. Be skeptical of every image that people have of you, and don't sit there passively while they barrage you with their expectations. In order to further upgrade your integrity (a project I hope you're in the midst of), you may have to make yourself immune, at least temporarily, to what everyone thinks of you.

Imagine that you're a circus acrobat whose specialty is working high in the air. You're skilled at swinging from one trapeze to another. You have utmost confidence in your timing and concentration and grip, so that when you let go of one bar and are flying toward the next, there's no doubt you'll make it. I believe that your life has now brought you to a transition that's metaphorically similar to the moment of being in between trapezes. Don't think too hard as you soar across the abyss; trust your instincts.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Sagittarian Shirley Chisholm was the first black woman elected to Congress. While serving seven terms, she was an outspoken warrior who fought tirelessly for the rights of women, minorities, and the poor. "My greatest political asset, which professional politicians fear," she said, "is my mouth, out of which comes all kinds of things one shouldn't always discuss for reasons of political expediency." Yet one of Chisholm's most famous exploits was her visit to segregationist politician George Wallace in the hospital after he was shot. Her supporters complained that she was consorting with the enemy, but years later it paid off. Wallace helped her win the votes of southern congressmen when she sponsored legislation to give domestic workers a minimum wage. Be like Chisholm this week, Sagittarius: Even as you open your big mouth to articulate controversial truths, reach out to those who disagree with you.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Readers sometimes ask me about Ophiuchus, the supposed 13th constellation. They've heard that it should be included in astrological thinking, and that it messes up the whole zodiacal system. Here's the truth: The proponents of Ophiuchus are self-described debunkers who hate astrology. Furthermore, they haven't actually taken the trouble to educate themselves about the ancient art. If they did even a smattering of honest investigation, they'd see how irrelevant their theory is. Let this serve as a cautionary tale, Capricorn. Right now it's crucial that you get your facts straight before critiquing anyone. Make sure that those who want to analyze you do the same. And beware of red herrings, straw men, and fool's gold.

The more it stretches your capacity and forces you to dig deeper into yourself for stamina and willpower and resourcefulness, the happier you'll be--and the more successful, too.

Life is stark at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, even for the people who aren't imprisoned there. Newsday reports that there are 23 men for every woman among the 2,800 free Americans. Raccoon-sized rats are fixtures in the local wildlife. The border between the base and the rest of Cuba is littered with underground mines. In recent months, however, a few luxuries have begun to arrive. There's now a Starbucks, Pizza Hut, and miniature golf course. I don't want to make light of the situation, but I do want these new developments to serve as a metaphor for you. What's the most desolate, forbidding area of your psyche? Build the equivalent of a miniature golf course there.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Happy Valentine Daze, Aries! As I meditated on what advice would be most likely to energize your love life, I thought of what Clarissa Pinkola Estes said in her book Women Who Run With the Wolves. "The desire to force love to live only in its most positive form," she wrote, "is what causes love ultimately to fall over dead." She obviously doesn't mean you should seek negativity on purpose. Rather, you should freely acknowledge that even the most sublime intimacy has a dark side. As long as you welcome love's difficulties, it will remain vital.

Happy Valentine Daze, Taurus! After extensive meditation about what advice would be most useful for your love life in 2006, I rejected this observation by The Simpsons' creator Matt Groening: "Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come." Do not, under any circumstances, make those your words to live by. Instead, consider the following counsel from Norman Mailer: "Love asks us that we be a little braver than is comfortable, a little more generous, a little more flexible. It means living on the edge more than we care to."

Happy Valentine Daze, Gemini! After strenuous meditation about what advice would be most likely to energize your love life, I decided on some wisdom from journalist Mignon McLaughlin. "The hardest-learned lesson," she wrote, "is that people have only their kind of love to give, not our kind." I hope her perspective liberates you to enjoy what love actually is, rather than to always be pining for what it could or should be.

"Love at first sight may be a matter of instinctively recognizing someone who will allow you to continue in comfortingly familiar--and often destructive--patterns learned in childhood." So said Salon.com's Lisa Zeidner in her review of Maggie Scarf's book Intimate Partners. Make that idea your watchword in the coming weeks. Let it be the beacon that guides you away from the sentimental illusions about romance that you may still be drawn to. After all, there are few things that undermine authentic love more than infantile wishes and naive fantasies. Happy Valentine Daze, Cancerian!

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Welcome to Free Will Astrology's annual "Swimsuit Issue." We do it differently than other publications. Sports Illustrated, for instance, fills its pages with photos of barely-clothed female models, whereas we provide verbal stimuli to help you get your fantasy life tuned up for the season of naked fun, which begins any minute for you Leos. The first image we'd like to evoke in your mind's eye is of you lounging in a swimsuit on an otherwise deserted tropical beach with an attractive member of your favorite gender (or three of them if you're in an expansive mood). Visualize him or her or them engaging in some behavior that simultaneously rouses your lust, your tenderness, and your compassion. See them carrying out a series of acts that not only thrills you sensually but also moves you to happy tears and causes you to overflow with spiritual contentment. Keep fantasizing for at least 15 minutes. Happy Valentine's Day, Leo!

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Happy Valentine Daze, Virgo! To begin our meditation on romance, let's consider psychologist Carl Jung's words: "People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own soul." Do you fit that description? Have you ever employed tortured logic to explain to yourself why you're not following your heart's promptings? In the past year, did you take a detour that has led you further and further away from your true home? Are you engaging in evasive measures in order to keep yourself from seeing the open secret about love that's right in front of you? I'm just asking, Virgo, not accusing. Only you know the correct answers.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Happy Valentine Daze, Libra! After an extensive search for the wisdom that would be most likely to energize your love life, I found the perfect advice. It comes to you courtesy of psychologist James Hillman: "For a relationship to stay alive, love alone is not enough. Without imagination, love stales into sentiment, duty, boredom. Relationships fail not because we have stopped loving but because we first stopped imagining." How will you act on this excellent counsel? Maybe you could take you and your closest ally to a sanctuary you've never dreamed you'd go to in a thousand years. Or do an exercise in which you ask each other questions you've never broached before. Or devise an experiment in which the two of you get to face an unfamiliar challenge together.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Happy Valentine Daze, Scorpio! To begin our meditation on love, let's turn our attention to Abhishek Parikh, an Indian man who claims to be the reincarnation of a very special woman. In his present life as well as in his last one, he believes he has served as the wife of the snake god Naagraaj. To perform his wifely duties, he sometimes transforms into a female snake himself, though he always returns to his male human form. I bring this up, Scorpio, because I think that you yourself have the potential of getting intimate with a snake god or snake goddess in the coming weeks. My gut instinct tells me so, and so does my analysis of the astrological omens. You don't have to become the deity's full-time wife or husband; being a part-time companion or apprentice will be just fine.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Happy Valentine Daze, Sagittarius! The more animal noises you make during the season of love, the better you're going to feel and the more successful you're likely to be. The astrological omens indicate that cosmic rhythms will tend to align in your favor if you express a whole range of primal feelings with moans, growls, cackling, and other non-verbal sounds. P.S. If you don't pursue this agenda with conscious intent, beastly behavior might possess you at inappropriate times, such as lion-like super-yawns in the middle of a meeting or uncontrollable yapping when you're suddenly overcome by territorial instincts.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Happy Valentine Daze, Capricorn! To begin our meditation on love, let's turn our attention to your appearance. I think you owe a huge debt of gratitude to the fact that you don't have the face and body of a dazzling supermodel or gorgeous hunk. The temptation to rely on your physical attractiveness at the expense of developing your character would be virtually irresistible. In the coming days, this fact will bring you a fresh batch of benefits, including a subtle breakthrough in your romantic life. Here's your quote of the week, from Katharine Hepburn: "It is the plain women who know about love. The beautiful women are too busy being fascinating."

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Happy Valentine Daze, Aquarius! The English novelist Julia Pardoe expressed an idea that would be useful for you to integrate into your thoughts about love in 2006. "In each human heart are a tiger, a pig, a donkey, and a nightingale," she wrote. "Diversity of character is due to their unequal activity." Why is this important for you to contemplate? In the coming weeks, I believe, you will have an unprecedented chance to bring the tiger and nightingale aspects to the forefront of both your own heart and the hearts of those whose affections mean most to you.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Happy Valentine Daze, Pisces! Borrowing the words of poet Pablo Neruda, I've prepared a love note for you to use as your own. Feel free to give these words to the person whose destiny needs to be woven more closely together with yours. I love you between shadow and soul. I love you as the plant that hasn't bloomed yet, and carries hidden within itself the light of flowers. I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. Because of you, the dense fragrance that rises from the earth lives in my body, rioting with hunger for the eternity of our victorious kisses.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

My friend Rose comes from a large extended family that does not include a single millionaire. There's no chance she will inherit a windfall from a dead relative. On the other hand, many religious devotees, humanitarians, and do-gooders have graced both sides of her family line. She regards her own idealistic aspirations as being a result of the legacy they left her; she thinks of herself as having received an inheritance composed of spiritual wealth. What about you, Aries? What are the special gifts of your heritage? What talents and capacities have you been blessed with by your ancestors? It's time to intensify your efforts to make use of them.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Do you have a forbidden fantasy? Is there some adventure you wish you could let yourself have, but you lack the money or spunk to attempt it? Have you been nursing an impossible dream that is no closer to fulfillment now than it was when you first conjured it up years ago? If so, Taurus, the time has come to resolve your relationship with it. Either renounce it and forget it forever, or else take a bold, practical step toward making it come true. P.S. You have more courage than you realize.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Fashion designer Rick Owens toiled in relative obscurity for years while perfecting his "glunge" look, which mixes glamour with grunge. Now he has his own acclaimed clothing line in Paris. Recently an interviewer asked him, "What is the most important lesson you've learned?" His reply: "We're all freaks." I'd like you to take that idea to heart, Gemini. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you'll benefit from fully acknowledging how odd, idiosyncratic, irregular, and mysterious you really are--and learning to love that fact. This week's second assignment is also spurred by Owens. "What's your definition of beauty?" he was asked. "With fitness, grooming and an open heart," he said, "absolutely anyone can be wildly attractive." Work on that, too. Revel in your wildly attractive freakiness.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

After torrential rains caused flooding in the small town where I live, the Thai restaurant was one of the few downtown businesses that was spared catastrophic damage. The maitre d' explained to me why as I ordered my to-go dinner tonight. "We've always hated our tile floor. It makes the place feel sterile, and it's slippery. People lose their footing if there's even a little wet spot. But when the three feet of floodwater poured in, our tile floor held up. All the stores around us had wooden floors that were destroyed." This is your metaphor of the week, Cancerian. Something in your life that you have regarded as a problem will become a saving grace.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

You may not realize how significant a role that architecture plays in shaping your moods, ideas, and decisions. I'm here to remind you that it does. The quality of the indoor space you regularly inhabit deeply influences what goes on inside your mind and body. It's not just the structure of the buildings I'm talking about, of course, but also the decor, the furniture, the carpets, and the colors. In 2006, it will be important for you to become more aware of this fact, and to be aggressive about putting yourself into environments that bring out the best in you. As a gift to yourself, spend some time inside the most uplifting building you know.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I decided to work on your horoscope while out in nature today. Armed with my notebook of astrology data, I found a fallen tree to use as a chair on the muddy bank of Ross Creek. As I gazed into the rain-swollen torrent and thought about you, a little voice in my head said I should give you the following message: To invoke the awareness that will help you formulate this week's most important questions, spend quality time watching water flow through the earth, watching clouds stream through the sky, and watching thoughts glide across your mind's eye.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Though the human body is born complete in one moment, the birth of the human heart is an ongoing process," writes John O'Donohue in his book Anam Cara. In other words, your capacity for love is forever on the brink of expanding. Your potential to be transformed by compassionate intimacy is inexhaustible. Your emotional intelligence is always ready to awaken more thoroughly, to ripen more brilliantly. Of course you can resist the ongoing pressure to give birth to more heart wisdom. Shrinking back from the relentless upheaval, you can reject the demanding bliss you're offered and retreat into safe numbness. Which way will you choose, Libra? This week will be a turning point.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

This isn't always the case, Scorpio, but right now you have a certain resemblance to that type of wild iris known as blue-eyed grass. Its stem isn't hardy enough to hold up more than one flower blossom at a time; before a new bloom sprouts, therefore, the old one has to wither. Similarly, you can't and shouldn't try to work on more than a single labor of love, at least for the next week. Devote all your concentration and care to it, ignoring the other possibilities. And don't worry: This narrowing of your focus is a good thing.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

The American Dialect Society has chosen the best new words of 2005. Winning in the "most creative" category was "whale tail," which refers to the top of a thong showing above the waistband of pants or a skirt. But the fresh coinage that's most meaningful to you right now, Sagittarius, is "truthiness." It's the quality people embody when they assert concepts that they wish to be true instead of sticking to the facts. In his TV show on Comedy Central, Stephen Colbert articulated a perfect example: "Who's Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was finished in 1914? If I want to say it happened in 1941, that's my right. I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart." It's always important for you to avoid truthiness yourself and protest it when it spills from others. But it's especially crucial now. Arm yourself with factiness.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Good news, Capricorn. Right now your financial prospects look almost as bright as those of the oil industry, whose earnings grew 42 percent in the last three months of 2005. There is a caveat, however. If, like the companies that sell gasoline, you attempt to capitalize on bad news and profit at the expense of the collective well-being, your money situation will suffer. To gather all of the good economic fortune that's available, you've got to redouble your efforts to maintain high levels of integrity.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Several of my friends have given names to their cars, and I know many other people who have bestowed appellations on their homes, their vacuum cleaners, their favorite trees, and their genitals. In Norse mythology, the god Thor affectionately called his magic golden hammer by the name Mjollnir. It so happens that this would be a ripe time for you to experiment with this approach, Aquarius. I think you'll find that as you name your home and car as well as every plant, toaster, traffic light, crow, and cloud, that the whole world will become more alive and friendly and helpful.

"We are what we pretend to be," wrote author Kurt Vonnegut, "so we must be careful about what we pretend to be." This is excellent advice to keep at the forefront of your awareness during the coming weeks, Pisces. Here's how I interpret his statement: There's not necessarily anything wrong with playing a role if that role is in alignment with your highest values. In fact, to make believe that you are the person you want to be is an excellent strategy for actually becoming the person you want to be.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I don't take drugs or alcohol, but I love to get high. Astrologer Caroline Casey states my belief perfectly when she says that we all need regular doses of vastness. So how do I crack open the doors of perception? Engaging in extreme horseplay is one way. Recently, for instance, three friends and I radically altered our consciousness in the middle of a cold night on the sidewalks of New York City's Chelsea district. Oblivious to the taxis roaring by, we drove ourselves cheerfully insane as we did Appalachian square dances, channeled slapstick imitations of dead comedians Lenny Bruce and Bill Hicks, and taught each other chaotic meditation techniques we'd learned from various fake shamans. I urge you to be inspired by this example, Aries. You're overdue for a dose of vastness that's unleashed by raucous fun.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Taurus philosopher Bertrand Russell gave this testimony about what motivated him: "Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and an unbearable pity for the suffering of humanity." To be in maximum alignment with cosmic rhythms, Taurus, I suggest that you boil down your desires to a slightly altered version of Russell's: a longing to both give and receive love, a hunger for knowledge, and a yearning to alleviate the suffering of your fellow humans.

Only about 20 percent of the population is capable of deriving the full benefit of my horoscopes. That's because most people don't speak the language of metaphor, which is a staple of my writing. Luckily, you're among the minority that appreciates the symbolic approach to communication, and so you'll be able to use the following oracle: You can't possibly defeat or outmaneuver the ogre who's monopolizing the treasure you covet. If you're smart, you'll realize that you should transfer your longing to a different treasure.

He can also dip his fingers into vats of molten lead and lie sandwiched between two beds of nails without incurring injury. There's no magic involved, he says. He relies solely on his understanding of science. Metaphorically speaking, these are the kinds of feats you'll be able to pull off in the coming week, Cancerian. Like Willey, you shouldn't depend on guesswork or luck. Do as he has done, which is research the laws of nature and use them to accomplish seemingly impossible tricks.

The federal government of the United States has been dominated by rightwingers for years. But an opposite trend is now sweeping through the other America. Leftist leaders have recently come into power in Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and Uruguay. This bears a certain resemblance to an adjustment that will soon be taking place in your life. Wherever you have become too one-sided, the other side will begin exerting a strong counterpoint. If any of your beliefs have become too dogmatic or unilateral, evidence will pour in to shake up your certainty. Don't worry: This is a good and healthy thing. You'll feel more flexible and free when the revolution comes.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)
The New York Times' Deborah Solomon interviewed Peter Watson, author of Ideas: A History of Thought and Invention, from Fire to Freud. "What is the single worst idea in history?" she asked him. "Without question, ethical monotheism," he replied. "The idea of one true god. The idea that our life and ethical conduct on earth determines how we will go in the next world. This has been responsible for most of the wars and bigotry in history." Personally, I disagree with his curious assessment. I think history's most terrible idea is the theory that some groups of people are smarter and better and deserve more rights than others. The coming week is a good time for you to meditate on these themes, Virgo. Which ideas do you consider bad ones, both those on a global scale and those that have at one time or another infected your belief system? (P.S. It's also a perfect moment to fight those bad ideas.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I was meditating on your horoscope as I rode my bike up a trail to the top of a hill. "Give me a sign," I asked the great mysterious intelligence known as nature. "Bless me with a symbol that will illuminate Libra's imminent future." My request was soon answered. I came upon a bare oak tree in whose low-hanging branches was nestled a radio-controlled toy airplane. Why was it there? Its flight path had obviously gone astray, but it didn't seem damaged. There was no one in sight. Why had its operator abandoned it? Here's how I interpreted the omen's meaning for you and your life, Libra: You experienced a minor glitch while engaged in some amusing activity, and that caused you to give up on the fun prematurely. It's time to go back and solve the problem, then resume your enjoyment.

"At the innermost core of all loneliness is a deep and powerful yearning for union with one's lost self," wrote Irish playwright Brendan Francis Behan. Let these words serve as your guiding light in the coming weeks, Scorpio. They should inspire you to be brave enough to confront the feelings of isolation that fester in your depths. That will in turn motivate you to reconnect with the parts of your psyche you were cut off from during times of trauma and unconsciousness in the past.

Professor Robert Crease asked physicists to name the ten most beautiful experiments of all time. The winners were elegant and simple. They required minimal apparatus, few or no assistants, and little computational power. One was Galileo's legendary proof of the nature of gravity, in which he dropped two objects of different weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Another was the brainchild of Isaac Newton, who used a prism to decompose sunlight into a spectrum of hues. I invite you to be inspired by the spirit of these beautiful experiments, Sagittarius. Come up with a lucid, ingenious hypothesis that will help you gather useful data about a question that's crucial for you to explore.

Right before Christmas, the U.S. Senate passed a bill that slashed funding for student loans, child care, and health benefits for the elderly and poor. Vice-President Dick Cheney aborted his trip abroad in order to race home and cast the tie-breaking vote. I suggest that you regard the 51 Scrooges who committed this sin as your anti-role models in the coming days, Capricorn. You can't afford to be anything but generous to the deprived and disadvantaged--including the underprivileged parts of your own psyche that you sometimes neglect.

Marie and Pierre Curie discovered radium. Chemist John Walker invented the match. Physicist Wilhelm Roentgen was the first person to find out about X-rays. What do these great minds have in common? They all refused to take out any patents in connection with their innovations, believing that they shouldn't make any profit on something that rightfully belongs to everyone. They're your role models right now, Aquarius. Let them inspire you to give away your brilliance for free. (P.S. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but there'll be a big reward for you if you do what I suggest.)

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You've entered the most shadowy and enigmatic phase of your astrological cycle, which is why I think you're about to have a lot of interesting fun. You should look forward to your travels in the abyss with exuberant anticipation. Here are some guidelines to help you get the most out of the coming days. (1) Do the things that are hardest to do, but do them gladly and with grace, as if they were a great privilege. (2) Stay in intimate connection with your dark side, but don't let that turn into an endorsement of your dark side's fantasies. (3) Brainstorm about how to disarm and neutralize your adversaries without fighting them.

The New York Times' Deborah Solomon interviewed Peter Watson, author of Ideas: A History of Thought and Invention, from Fire to Freud. "What is the single worst idea in history?" she asked him. "Without question, ethical monotheism," he replied. "The idea of one true god. The idea that our life and ethical conduct on earth determines how we will go in the next world. This has been responsible for most of the wars and bigotry in history." Personally, I disagree with his curious assessment. I think history's most terrible idea is the theory that some groups of people are smarter and better and deserve more rights than others. The coming week is a good time for you to meditate on these themes, Virgo. Which ideas do you consider bad ones, both those on a global scale and those that have at one time or another infected your belief system? (P.S. It's also a perfect moment to fight those bad ideas.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I was meditating on your horoscope as I rode my bike up a trail to the top of a hill. "Give me a sign," I asked the great mysterious intelligence known as nature. "Bless me with a symbol that will illuminate Libra's imminent future." My request was soon answered. I came upon a bare oak tree in whose low-hanging branches was nestled a radio-controlled toy airplane. Why was it there? Its flight path had obviously gone astray, but it didn't seem damaged. There was no one in sight. Why had its operator abandoned it? Here's how I interpreted the omen's meaning for you and your life, Libra: You experienced a minor glitch while engaged in some amusing activity, and that caused you to give up on the fun prematurely. It's time to go back and solve the problem, then resume your enjoyment.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"At the innermost core of all loneliness is a deep and powerful yearning for union with one's lost self," wrote Irish playwright Brendan Francis Behan. Let these words serve as your guiding light in the coming weeks, Scorpio. They should inspire you to be brave enough to confront the feelings of isolation that fester in your depths. That will in turn motivate you to reconnect with the parts of your psyche you were cut off from during times of trauma and unconsciousness in the past.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Professor Robert Crease asked physicists to name the ten most beautiful experiments of all time. The winners were elegant and simple. They required minimal apparatus, few or no assistants, and little computational power. One was Galileo's legendary proof of the nature of gravity, in which he dropped two objects of different weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Another was the brainchild of Isaac Newton, who used a prism to decompose sunlight into a spectrum of hues. I invite you to be inspired by the spirit of these beautiful experiments, Sagittarius. Come up with a lucid, ingenious hypothesis that will help you gather useful data about a question that's crucial for you to explore.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Right before Christmas, the U.S. Senate passed a bill that slashed funding for student loans, child care, and health benefits for the elderly and poor. Vice-President Dick Cheney aborted his trip abroad in order to race home and cast the tie-breaking vote. I suggest that you regard the 51 Scrooges who committed this sin as your anti-role models in the coming days, Capricorn. You can't afford to be anything but generous to the deprived and disadvantaged--including the underprivileged parts of your own psyche that you sometimes neglect.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Marie and Pierre Curie discovered radium. Chemist John Walker invented the match. Physicist Wilhelm Roentgen was the first person to find out about X-rays. What do these great minds have in common? They all refused to take out any patents in connection with their innovations, believing that they shouldn't make any profit on something that rightfully belongs to everyone. They're your role models right now, Aquarius. Let them inspire you to give away your brilliance for free. (P.S. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but there'll be a big reward for you if you do what I suggest.)

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You've entered the most shadowy and enigmatic phase of your astrological cycle, which is why I think you're about to have a lot of interesting fun. You should look forward to your travels in the abyss with exuberant anticipation. Here are some guidelines to help you get the most out of the coming days. (1) Do the things that are hardest to do, but do them gladly and with grace, as if they were a great privilege. (2) Stay in intimate connection with your dark side, but don't let that turn into an endorsement of your dark side's fantasies. (3) Brainstorm about how to disarm and neutralize your adversaries without fighting them.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In my book Pronoia Is the Antidote for Paranoia, there's a 1500-word piece extolling a few of the many ways in which I feel that living on this planet is a glorious privilege. You're in a phase of your astrological cycle when it makes perfect sense for you to write something similar. To be in maximum alignment with cosmic luck, therefore, you should sit down and compose a list of everything that works well for you, delights you, and helps you feel at home in the world. Call it your "Joy Manifesto."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

For the last nine years the daffodils in my yard have blossomed in mid-February. This time around, however, their yellow blooms sprouted in the first week of January. Another sign of global warming? I don't know. So far the flowers' early arrival hasn't been a problem. They're still going strong, showing a hardy resistance to sporadic bursts of cold and rain. According to my astrological analysis, Taurus, you have also ripened a bit prematurely. Ahead of schedule, you've accomplished your upgrade and are ready to try your hand at a spicier challenge. Like the daffodils, you will probably do fine. Just one piece of advice, though: Don't scrimp on your efforts to protect and nurture yourself.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Having ridden my mountain bike through Marin County's hills for years, I've watched Mt. Tamalpais go through endless changes. Depending on the weather, the season, and the time of day, it has been a different mountain on each occasion I've seen it. When the low-slung sun illuminates the thin layer of mist covering it late on a winter afternoon, for example, I can't believe it's the same mountain that lies beneath a full moon beaming down on it through a hole in the streaming clouds on a summer night. The poet in me says I'd be justified in giving it a new name on each of the thousands of times I've been in its presence. If you're honest, Gemini, you know that my relationship with Mt. Tamalpais is very much like your experience of the people you see every day. They're always fresh, always different from who they were last time. This is an ideal time to acknowledge and celebrate that mystery.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Two people in Evansville, Indiana were exploring an office building they wanted to buy. To the surprise of the owner, they discovered the structure had a second story that had been closed up for decades. The three of them gained access to the hidden area and found business papers that had last touched human hands in 1931. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, Cancerian, you will soon make a similar find. Sealed-off parts of your world you didn't know existed will become available for your inspection.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

The Galactic Question Center at Galquest.blogspot.com asks you to imagine the following scenario: Upon awakening one morning, you find that you are lying on top of a mile-high pole that is 24 feet in diameter. Next to you is a can of unopened chicken soup, a tube of strong glue, a half-mile long rope, and a German shepherd dog. Can you come up with a way to get yourself back down to the ground? I don't think you will face this exact predicament in the coming week, Leo, but it has a metaphorical resemblance to a knotty riddle you'll be presented with. Fortunately, you have the brain power to solve it.

Burton Butler is Northern California's top Skunk Whisperer. Because he has developed a special rapport with skunks, he's often called on by spooked suburbanites to safely remove the critters when they take up residence in basements and garages. I believe you will have an analogous talent in the coming weeks, Virgo. Due to your smart, unsentimental brand of sensitivity, you will be able to defuse potentially smelly problems with little or no damage to either the stinker or stinkees.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

In the science fiction film Contact, Jodie Foster plays a scientist who's chosen as an astronaut for a solo trip to an alien world far from our solar system. As she careens through a staggering array of sublime celestial phenomena, she muses aloud to herself, half crying, "It's so beautiful . . . so beautiful . . . They should have sent a poet." To properly understand and appreciate the experiences that lie ahead for you, Libra, adopt her advice: Awaken the poet within you, and let him or her lead the way as you go on your adventures. You say you don't have an inner poet? I disagree. We all have one. It's the part of you that thinks like the moon, dreams like the sun, and loves like the earth.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In her San Francisco Chronicle column, Leah Garchik reported that a woman shopping at a local Safeway grocery store had heard "Blitzkrieg Bop," a snarling anthem by the Ramones, playing over the loudspeaker. Was it an unfortunate development that besmirched the integrity of the seminal punk band, or a welcome sign that what was once raw rebel squawk is infiltrating the mainstream? You're ready to entertain an analogous question that pertains to your own personal quest for authenticity, Scorpio. Should you compromise a little so as to inject your influence into a setting where it's desperately needed? Or should you remain aloof and pure, content to affect mostly just those who already agree with you?

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

This should not be a race-down-an-eight-lane-superhighway kind of week, Sagittarius. From what I can tell, it's got to be an exploratory-meander-down-a-bunch-of-dirt-roads kind of week. In order to be exposed to what's important for you to learn, you'll have to take the scenic route through back country. Please don't be in a hurry. Regard the muddy patches and potholes as your allies. It's high time to slow down and smell the cow manure, which might be more accurately referred to as fertilizer.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

A psychologist in the U.K. believes that January 24 is the "most depressing day of the year," at least in the Northern Hemisphere. Cliff Arnall, whose specialty is seasonal disorders, says this day is typically a low point, when glum feelings generated by overcast weather, debt from the holidays, and broken New Year's resolutions reach a crescendo. While this might hold true for the other signs of the zodiac, Capricorn, it doesn't apply to you. The astrological omens reveal you're at the peak of your cycle, when you can triumph over challenges and accomplish breakthroughs that might normally be impossible. I suggest you proceed as if long-standing limitations have become irrelevant.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

A guy I met in a bar in New York's Lower East Side discoursed at length on the psycho-spiritual meaning of The Wizard of Oz. "The Wicked Witch of the West was Dorothy's greatest teacher," he told me. "The witch's animosity compelled her to learn new tricks, master her circumstances, and ultimately find her way home." I hope that lately you have been benefiting from your own personal version of the Wicked Witch, Aquarius, and I trust that you will soon graduate from your need for the lessons he or she has provided.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Krakow, Poland hasn't had a full-time rabbi on duty since the events of World War II decimated the once-thriving Jewish population. Recently that changed with the arrival of Rabbi Avraham Flaks from Israel. He has promised to help build solidarity in the small Jewish community that has arisen since the fall of Communism and the end of the Polish government's unofficial policy of anti-Semitism. I foresee a comparable development in your own life, Pisces. You are poised to experience a reawakening of spiritual impulses that have been dormant for some time. If you follow the clues you'll be given, it's quite possible that a teacher, leader, or other inspirational influence will come to catalyze further excitement.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

At New York's Museum of Modern Art, I brought my face to within a few inches of Vincent van Gogh's painting, "The Starry Night." It looked delicious. I wanted to kiss it. Its stars were throbbing and voluptuous. The night sky shimmered with currents of spiraling energy. In the foreground, the cypress tree flared like a shadowy flame. I could also see that the artist had been less than thorough in applying his paint. Especially on the edges, but also in the middle of the painting, slivers of untouched canvas showed through. Fierce, innocent, nourishing, reckless, unfinished, this priceless work drank my attention for a long time, constantly refreshing my eyes with what seemed to be its ceaseless movement. It was exactly what I wish you to be like in the coming week, Aries.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Hundreds of years ago, the Roman Catholic Church conjured up the concept of "Limbo." It was supposedly a murky realm between heaven and hell that housed the souls of babies who died before they were baptized and righteous people who lived before the time of Christ. Later "limbo" also came to have a non-religious meaning, referring to the state of uncertainty experienced by a person who is waiting for a resolution or decision. Last November, the Church formally retired the concept of Limbo, declaring it to be an outmoded hypothesis that should be hereafter ignored. In the coming weeks, Taurus, you will have an excellent opportunity to escape your own personal version of limbo. It's time to declare yourself a master of the torturous lessons you were called on to learn while stranded there.

I intoned a Hindu prayer and did a sacred Sufi dance as I stood inside a Native American medicine wheel and carried out parts of a Buddhist ritual while holding a Wiccan wand and Christian cross. My intention was to seek divine favor in helping you open to the possibility that you can expand your spiritual life considerably in the coming months, especially if you go exploring for inspiration outside of the beliefs and rituals that have nourished you up until now.

The British government recently legalized civil partnerships for gay couples, giving them the same rights and privileges as married heterosexuals. I suggest you regard this breakthrough as a vitalizing symbol for what you yourself can accomplish in the coming weeks. Unions that you never thought possible will be within your power to create. Previously unimaginable connections will become normal and natural. You will have the potential to be a catalyst, mediator, and lubricant for a host of fresh combinations.

On behalf of Saturn, the Lord of Karma, I hereby invite you to take advantage of a very ripe opportunity to make substantial reductions in your debt--your karmic debt, that is, not your financial debt. (Though I have it on good authority that lowering your karmic IOU will have a ripple effect that will ultimately alleviate the struggles with money you might be suffering from.) But to return to the main point: This is one of the best times ever for fixing the mistakes you made in the past, atoning for the pain you have caused, and correcting the imbalances that resulted from your careless behavior.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I've discovered a new way to stimulate my psychic powers. I simply eat large amounts of wasabi, the bracing horseradish-like paste that's traditionally served with sushi. Its astringent potency seems to crack open an inter-dimensional wormhole in my brain through which news of the future pours in. After meditating on the astrological factors coming to bear on you, I ingested the stuff to give my divinations some extra oomph. Here's what I came up with: You need the equivalent of the wasabi approach right now--some gentle shock, self-administered, that will extend the range of your normal perceptions.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

While riding my mountain bike out in the wilds, I passed an oak tree growing on a hillside. On the slope below it, one of the tree's thick roots poked up through the ground for about three feet, then re-entered the earth. I immediately thought of you and your imminent future, Libra. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, your roots will soon be exposed, giving you a vivid glimpse at what has been going on below the surface all this time. The foundations of your life, which are normally hidden from view, will be at least partially open to your exploration and study.

Balding, five feet tall, and heavy set, 61-year-old Scorpio actor Danny Devito is not renowned as an embodiment of male beauty. That's what helped make his appearance on an episode of the old TV show "Friends" so amusing. He played a striptease artist dressed as a cop who came to entertain Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe. The spectacle of him dancing provocatively as he removed his clothes was appalling, fascinating, funny, and ultimately harmless. I predict you will have at least two experiences that fit this description in the coming week.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In an interview with The New York Times, the Dalai Lama spoke of how he deals with sexual feelings. As a monk who has taken a vow of celibacy, he said he'd prefer not to experience that appetite at all. "If you itch, it's nice to scratch it," he mused, quoting the Buddhist teacher Nagarjuna. "But it's better to have no itch at all." This counsel applies to a wide variety of situations, including one that will be especially important for you in the coming months. I suggest that you take an inventory of your needs and urges and compulsions, and try to dissolve those that have little meaning or purpose for you in the big picture of your destiny.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The San Francisco 49ers football team recently endured one of its worst seasons ever. But as the losses piled up, head coach Mike Nolan continued to profess an optimism that seemed deluded to most observers. After an especially galling defeat in the team's 13th game, however, he finally confessed he was a little down. In response, San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Ray Ratto exulted, "At least Mike Nolan isn't calling a chemical fire the Aurora Borealis anymore." I bring this up, Capricorn, because in recent months you have now and then suffered from the reverse problem: It's like you've been gazing at the Aurora Borealis and theorizing it's a chemical fire. But this glitch in your attitude is now becoming untenable. Your pretty good luck is evolving into damn fine blessings. It's time to acknowledge the beautiful truths in all of their glory.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

German scientist Juergen Zulley specializes in research about the hours we spend unconscious lying in our beds every night. He has come to the conclusion that a lack of sleep can make you stupid, fat, and sick. It weakens your memory, decreases a hormone that helps control your cravings for food, and undermines the healthy function of your heart, digestive system, and circulation. I would add that sleep deprivation reduces the time you spend dreaming, which compromises your mental hygiene. All of these consequences would be major problems for you in the next two weeks, Aquarius. If anything, you need to sleep more than usual. I implore you to get at least eight hours a night. More would be better.

Officials in the California coastal city of Malibu recently updated their manual on emergency preparedness. In the event of a tsunami, they advised the public, surfers should not try to ride the tidal waves, but should flee inland. While that might be good counsel from a literal perspective, Pisces, on a metaphorical level I think you should do the opposite in the coming week. As the tidal wave of opportunities flows toward you, don't run away. Instead, do your best to surf it as far and as long as you can.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm hoping that in 2006 you will work your ass off with great ingenuity--not just at your job, but in every area of your life. Do you have it in you to break all your previous records for brilliant diligence? Are you willing to summon fierce discipline and crafty willpower not only to pump up your career ambitions but also to refine your approach to intimacy and increase your command over your own emotions? Are you finally ready to master all the excruciating but crucial details you've always avoided? If so, you could generate years' worth of blessings.



Normally my Expanded Audio Horoscopes cover just a week at a time. But the past two weeks and this week, I am offering explorations of the entire year ahead. To hear part three of my IN-DEPTH, LONG-TERM FORECAST FOR YOUR LIFE IN 2006, check out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. You can also listen to part one from two weeks ago and part two from last week.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Some religious traditions preach the doctrine that desire is a major obstacle to enlightenment. To escape from the predicament of your suffering, they insist, you must overcome all of your yearning. But Tantric scholar Daniel Odier believes this dogma is a delusion. In his book Desire: The Tantric Path to Awakening, he says desire should be at the heart of spiritual practice. Not all longings are equally sacred, of course: Fantasies about winning the lottery or seeing an adversary punished are not on a par with wanting to expand your capacity to bestow blessings and give love. In 2006, Taurus, consider the possibility that Odier is right. Try out the hypothesis that the most spiritual thing you can do is cultivate high-minded yearnings.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"The Simpsons" TV show has made the leap to the Arab world. Broadcast by satellite from Dubai, it reaches a big audience in the Middle East. A few transformations were necessary, however. In accordance with Islamic law, the man of the house doesn't drink beer or eat pork. Instead, he enjoys soda and beef sausages. His name is Omar instead of Homer, and he doesn't frequent squalid bars or befriend scruffy derelicts as he does in the American version of the show. On the other hand, son Bart (now called Badr) is still a brat. Omar is as lazy as Homer, and, like the original, works at a nuclear power facility. I mention this, Gemini, because it's a good analogue for your possible future. In 2006, you will have the power and opportunity to translate something you're good at into a brand new sphere.

There's no delicate way to say this, so please stop reading and come back next week if you're offended by graphic references to pleasure. According to my analysis of the long-term astrological omens, you're on tap to experience more orgasms in 2006 than you have in any previous year. On average, your climaxes are also likely to be longer and more intense. Other varieties of bliss, rapture, and joy will probably occur at record levels, as well. Think you can handle it?

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Recently someone asked me, "What do you look for in an ally, Rob?" Here's what I said: "I favor people who take responsibility for their unripe qualities and don't spew their undigested angst on me when they're feeling low." I think this approach should become a priority for you, Leo. In 2006, you will have striking opportunities to upgrade your relationship to relationships. One of the best ways to do that is to give special preference to connections with emotionally intelligent people who work hard to transmute their own darkness.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In 2006, you will have greatest success if you approach every experience as a student. Your ability to experience happiness will expand if you re-ignite your love of learning and become perpetually ablaze with curiosity. You know that old expression, "When the student is ready, the teacher will appear"? I suggest you make yourself ready, because a crucial teacher is or will soon be in your vicinity. Here's another key piece of advice, courtesy of J. Bronowski: "It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin, barefoot irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known, but to question it."

Libra (September 23-October 22)

In a few weeks, economist Benjamin Bernanke will begin serving as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, becoming the most important person in setting America's monetary policy. Though news reports typically describe him as cautious and scholarly, he has promised to prevent deflation by any means necessary--even by printing lots of extra money and throwing it out of helicopters. If that occurs in the coming months, members of your sign will no doubt be in the right places at the right times to gather up disproportionately large shares of those dollars floating down from above. The astrological omens suggest that 2006 will be a time of financial luck for Librans of every nationality. If you're ever going to benefit from a windfall, it'll be this year.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In my homeland of Northern California, four of the most overused terms are "juicy," "sacred," "radical," and "wild." I haven't made a scientific study, but I'd guess that maybe 30 percent of all workshops and self-help books originating in this part of the world have at least one of those words in their titles. As a connoisseur of language, I naturally try to avoid them myself. Nevertheless, your long-term astrological omens demand that I invoke them to describe your destiny. In fact, I'm duty-bound to predict that 2006 will be the Year of Juicy Sacred Radical Wildness for you Scorpios. Do your best, please, to express the primal potency of these words.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

A few weeks ago a group of people in the Netherlands reserved a large hall in hopes of breaking the world record for falling dominoes. Their goal was to set up and then topple 4,321,000 of the rectangular black tiles. While they were working, a sparrow flew in an open window and accidentally knocked over 23,000 pieces. It was only a temporary setback, however. The record-seekers restored the prematurely fallen pieces and ultimately achieved their goal. I predict that this vignette will have a metaphorical similarity to your destiny in 2006. If you assign yourself an epic yet fun goal (which I hope you will), you'll probably experience an unforeseen interruption, but will prevail in the end. (P.S. Don't do anything like what the Dutch people did, which was shoot the bird.)

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Stage magician David Copperfield made an intriguing announcement recently. He told the German magazine Galore that in his next show, he will use magic to make a woman pregnant--without touching her. That's similar to the kind of mojo you will possess in 2006, Capricorn. It's true that your success in the past has usually come from your pragmatic intelligence, organizational ability, and thoroughness. But in the coming months you will also have a talent for conjuring beautiful illusions that ultimately become very real.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Every person you know has a different idea about who you are, and none of those notions is exactly the same as the image you have of yourself. In other words, there are hundreds of unauthorized versions of you in addition to the one you believe in. Usually you don't have much power to control this, but that could change in 2006. More than at any other previous time, you'll have a knack for bringing public opinion into alignment with your own picture of yourself. Your reputation may even come to closely resemble the person you really are.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I encourage you to climb trees in 2006, Pisces. I also suggest that you regularly look down at the world from mountaintops and skyscrapers and flying dreams. Get above it all, in other words. Give yourself the pleasure of gazing from vistas that inspire you to meditate on the really big picture. You might also consider expanding your consciousness now and then if you do so in a disciplined, careful, and responsible way. (Getting high on a mix of street meth with strangers at 3 a.m. is not what I mean.) Your magical symbol for the year is a golden ladder.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Thai coffee salesman Prayoon Thongjon owns a pet crocodile. So thoroughly has he tamed the creature that he lets it sleeps in his bed with him, even resting his head on it as if it were a pillow. I predict that you will make a comparable conquest in 2006, Aries. Some dragonish influence that would be risky for most people to harbor will become your ally. Congratulations in advance on both your courage and the ingenuity you will summon to wrestle that beast into submission.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"We live in a world with too much music," writes Joe Nickell at Missoulian.com. He's bothered by the fact that everywhere he goes, there are tunes pouring from cell phones and mp3 players and TVs and radios and live bands. As far as you're concerned, though, Nickell is utterly off-base. In 2006, you should take advantage of the profusion; you should immerse yourself in music more than you ever have before. To do so will be instrumental in helping you accomplish your top assignment in the coming months, which is to feel deep, rich, interesting emotions as often as possible.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Many Geminis fit the description of a class of people that Wired magazine calls "yeppies," or "young experimenting perfection seekers." Overwhelmed by a profusion of conflicting opportunities, they are restless and insatiable. They treat life "as an exercise in comparison shopping, refusing to commit for fear of missing a better offer." While this approach is pretty normal for your tribe, I suspect it won't work as well in 2006 as it has for you in the past. That's why I urge you to try out some very different attitudes: a tolerance for imperfection, a respect for limits, an appreciation for the value of peace of mind, and a willingness to concentrate on just two or three possibilities instead of 17.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The coming months will not be a time for less talk and more action, my fellow Cancerian, but for more talk and more action. Here are other prescriptions to help you get the most out of 2006: Go on wilder adventures and entertain fewer superstitions. Indulge in fewer mood swings and invest in an experience that will serve as the best anchor you've ever had. Explore your secrets more aggressively, but keep fewer secrets. Work harder to know the difference between true intuitions and fearful delusions. Feel less remorse and more forgiveness. Cultivate wetter love and dryer humor. Commit yourself to faster promise-keeping and slower fault-finding.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I know people who love the feeling of family but who don't have much contact with their parents and siblings and haven't started their own broods. Instead, they quench their longing for an intimate network by hooking up with a spiritual family--a tribe of like-minded people who share their values. The coming months will be prime time for you to either find a group like that or, if you already have one, to deepen and expand your web of connections. You don't have to sacrifice your relations with your biological kin to do so. The more family you have, the better your mental health will be.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In her book Women Who Run With the Wolves, Clarissa Pinkola Estes talks a lot about fairy tales. As a psychotherapist, she recognizes that the conditions they depict are similar to how the deepest part of the psyche works. A central theme of fairy tale justice, she says, is that it's always a good idea to be kind to people who don't seem important or beautiful or cool. Characters who honor that principle are invariably rewarded, while those who spurn it are punished. This will be a key idea for you in 2006, Virgo. You can't afford to dismiss those you consider your inferiors, nor should you demonize the less attractive aspects of your own nature. Your success will hinge on the care you take with underdogs.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I have selected a quote by Irish playwright Brendan Behan to serve as your motto in 2006. I suggest that you write it out on a piece of red paper and place it in a prominent place like your bathroom mirror or computer monitor. "If you have a talent, use it in every which way possible," said Behan. "Don't hoard it. Don't dole it out like a miser. Spend it lavishly like a millionaire intent on going broke."

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Widely regarded as a top military historian, Martin van Creveld has written books that have been influential in shaping modern theories of warfare. The U.S. Army makes his work required reading for its officers. That's why it was so remarkable when he described America's invasion of Iraq in 2003 as "the most foolish war since Emperor Augustus in 9 BC sent his legions into Germany and lost them." I urge you to regularly imitate Creveld's example in 2006, Scorpio: Speak out in dramatic fashion against the follies that your expertise gives you the right to critique. Drawing on your special experience and knowledge, make rigorous evaluations of the authorities and institutions whose decisions affect your life.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"Dear Rob: I'm a very analytical person, with a doctorate in nuclear physics and a high-tech job. All my training and business savvy tell me that your astrology column is superstitious bullshit, yet every time I've faced a crisis in the last ten years, your horoscopes have provided accurate wisdom and counsel when things seemed darkest. On the one hand this makes no sense, and on the other hand I don't care that it doesn't make any sense. Somehow I'm able to draw sustenance from something whose power I don't understand or even believe in. In any case, thank you! -Humble Sagittarian Genius." Dear Sagittarius: In 2006, you Sagittarians will have the chance to benefit from many phenomena that fit the description you applied to my column. Open yourself wide to mystery.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Germany and the Soviet Union failed to sign a peace treaty after the global hostilities of the mid-20th century. Technically, then, World War II never officially ended. This lack of closure doesn't seem to have had any lingering repercussions, though, so I won't worry about it. On the other hand, there are unresolved situations from your past that are still causing you problems. In my astrological opinion, 2006 is an ideal time to finally wrap up all the unfinished business that has been subtly draining you. It's a perfect opportunity for the ultimate karmic cleansing, preferably carried out with grace, gratitude, and generosity.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In 1503, wealthy silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo commissioned Leonardo da Vinci to paint a portrait of his wife Lisa. But when Leonardo finished the work, now known as the "Mona Lisa," del Giocondo was so dissatisfied with it that he refused to pay for it. It seems he didn't recognize its value. I offer this as a teaching story for you, Aquarius. Please make sure that when you get what you ask for in 2006, you don't make the same mistake del Giocondo did. Eagerly welcome your dream-come-true, even if it's different from what you expected.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In his book The Disappearance of the Universe, Gary Renard quotes the counsel of his teacher: "A jet airliner is always going off course, but through constant correction it arrives at its destination. So will you arrive at yours." Remember that advice throughout 2006, Pisces. My analysis of the astrological omens suggests that you will be frequently straying from the path of your highest destiny, and yet that's exactly what needs to happen in order for you to reach your highest destiny. Forced to keep making regular adjustments, you will tone and strengthen your willpower, which is essential to you achieving the goals that really matter.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Happy Holy Daze, Aries! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What symbolic item might inspire you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2006? And the answer is: "The Daughter of Jacob Meyer," one of Vincent van Gogh's first drawings. He did it when he was 27 years old. That's right: The celebrated painter didn't even begin his life's work until then, having failed in his careers as an art dealer and preacher. In recommending this as a present for you, I hope you'll be inspired to realize that no matter what you've done up until this point, the coming year will give you a chance to start fresh on a new quest--maybe even a calling that will sustain you for decades.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Happy Holy Daze, Taurus! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gifts for you. What symbolic items might inspire you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2006? And the answer is: several full-length mirrors that you can arrange in such a way so as to study what you look like from behind and from the side as well as from the front. What's my reasoning? I believe you should get to know yourself much, much better in the coming months. You should gaze into your own mysteries far more frequently than you ever have before, and try to see yourself with as much compassionate objectivity as possible.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Happy Holy Daze, Gemini! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gifts for you. What symbolic items might stimulate you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2006? The answer is: a lot of beautiful, comfortable shoes suitable for a variety of moods, from hiking to working to traveling to dancing. I recommend this dramatic upgrade in footwear because I think it would help drive home the single most important task you have ahead of you, which is to come all the way down to earth. This is the year you've got to become as well-grounded as you've ever dared to be.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Happy Holy Daze, Cancerian! I've decided that the best possible gift you could give yourself this holiday season is this: a promise that you will love yourself with more wild abandon, reverent devotion, and unpredictable ingenuity in 2006. If you agree with my idea, then I suggest you make a formal pledge to do just that, preferably written out on a piece of paper and placed in a prominent place in your home. To carry out your vow, you might want to commit to a regular schedule of thoughtful gestures, like buying yourself a dozen roses or getting a massage twice a month--or handing yourself a compliment and putting yourself in the presence of awesome beauty once a day.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Happy Holy Daze, Leo! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gifts for you. What symbolic items might stimulate you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2006? Here's my answer: a skateboard or snowboard or bongo board. If you developed your proficiency on one of these, you'd be cultivating the same capacity you should build in your psyche: really good balance. In the coming months, I hope you will become a master of maintaining your equilibrium, seeing all sides of every story, and taking the middle path between two extremes.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Happy Holy Daze, Virgo! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gifts for you. What symbolic offerings might inspire you to be in closest alignment with the cosmic currents in 2006? I've decided on a pair of binoculars, a microscope, and sunglasses with mirrors in the corner of each lens that allow you to gaze on the reflections of things behind you. These, I hope, would give you the message that you should try hard to see further, deeper, and more clearly; you should become more greedily eager to notice details you've been blind to in the past.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Happy Holy Daze, Libra! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gifts for you. What symbolic items might stimulate you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2006? The first thing that comes to mind is a bar of gold bullion or a stack of gold coins. It might stir up your financial imagination and motivate you to take aggressive steps to increase your income, which would be right in line with the scenario that  the astrological omens suggest is possible. What might be even more effective, though, is a photo or image or drawing that captures the invigorating experiences you'll be able to buy yourself when you have more money.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Happy Holy Daze, Scorpio! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What symbolic offering might inspire you to be in closest alignment with the cosmic currents in 2006? I've decided on a magnesium firestarter, a metal tool with a striking rod that's guaranteed to kindle a flame even when conditions are wet. This would, I hope, send you the message that your job in the coming months is to be constantly ablaze--to ignite passions, burn down obstacles, and be a source of intense light and warmth and energy wherever you go.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Happy Holy Daze, Sagittarius! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What would best get you ready for 2006? What symbolic offering might motivate you to take maximum advantage of the astrological opportunities? And the answer is: the biggest, baddest vacuum cleaner ever made--a sleek, chic cleaning machine with turbocharged suction power, a hundred different attachments, and a very long reach. Such a gift would, I think, be an inspiring metaphor as you dive into the coming year's most important project: to purge every last bit of messiness and chaos and karmic dirt that have accumulated in your life during the last ten years.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Happy Holy Daze, Capricorn! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gifts for you. What items might inspire you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2006? And the answer is: anything that makes you laugh harder, deeper, faster, and more often. For me that would be something like DVDs by comedians Margaret Cho, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and Sarah Silverman, but you might need different stimuli. The point is, you've got to significantly raise your Laugh Quotient in the coming months. The astrological omens say it's the only strategy that's guaranteed to make you an expert problem-solver, increase your intelligence, and keep you in peak health.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Happy Holy Daze, Aquarius! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What symbolic item might inspire you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2006? I've decided it would be a fortune cookie inside of which was an oracle based on an old Sufi saying: "I was a hidden treasure and I longed to be known." This would serve as your motto and mantra in the coming months, a reminder that it's high time for you to come out of every closet, throw off all your disguises, and reveal the curious, beautiful truths about yourself. Even if you don't do that, I bet you'll still become better known in 2006; not necessarily famous, but certainly more accurately perceived and more deeply understood.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Happy Holy Daze, Pisces! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What would best get you ready for 2006? What symbolic offering might motivate you to take maximum advantage of the astrological opportunities ahead? And the answer is: a roundtrip plane ticket to the mysterious frontier or thrilling sanctuary or provocative paradise you've been fantasizing about off and on for a long time. Why? Because this is the year you really need to escape the insidious comforts that have been sapping your ability to be the brave dreamer you were born to be.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's possible there's still enough oil buried in the earth to sustain our civilization's exorbitant appetite for material comforts for another 100 years. Or it may be true, as some researchers suggest, that global reserves of black gold are rapidly dwindling, and 20 years from now we'll all be farmers and hunters sitting around campfires at night telling stories. Whichever scenario comes to pass, Aries, you'll be happiest and smartest and healthiest if you cultivate a simple and earthy relationship with luxury--maybe something akin to poet Omar Khayyam's notion, which was "a jug of wine, a loaf of bread, and thou beside me singing in the wilderness." The coming week is a perfect time for you to practice this approach.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Science writer Carl Sagan liked to say that "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." He often invoked that idea in his crusade to debunk theories he considered outlandish, like the proposition that extraterrestrials are visiting our planet. While I think Sagan's measuring stick is usually quite useful, you should be careful about applying it too fanatically in the coming week. Surprising and marvelous possibilities are headed your way, and at least one of them will be very real but impossible for your rational mind to validate. 



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

As I meditated on your immediate future, I got a vision of you making your way through an obstacle course--scurrying across booby-trapped terrains, shimmying through tunnels, climbing over barriers, leaping across ditches. Curiously, there was not the least bit of stress etched on your face. On the contrary, your eyes were wide and your expression was exultant. You seemed to regard this not as an ordeal, but as a welcome opportunity to expand your resourcefulness.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The English word "silly" comes from the German "selig," meaning holy, blissful. In accordance with your current astrological omens, I invite you to seek out experiences that blend the ancient and modern senses of the word. For example, explore the possibility that goofy joy is not at all incompatible with a yearning for the sacred. Treat yourself to fun that fills you with both giddiness and reverence.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty designed to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and thereby slow global warming.  Though 157 nations have ratified it, a notable exception has been the United States, which is the planet's leading polluter. To their credit, millions of American citizens have launched a grassroots movement to rebel against the federal government's puzzling stubbornness. One hundred sixty-six cities have agreed to the Kyoto Protocol. I suggest you take a similar approach in your own sphere, Aries. When a powerful authority acts stupid or when a foggy bureaucracy threatens to paralyze progress, take matters into your own hands. Ignore the mediocrity at the top as you mobilize everyone else to do what's right.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I don't think you'll become the equivalent of a king or queen in the coming weeks, but you could be instrumental in determining who becomes a king or queen. And that would ultimately be fun for you. Likewise, I doubt that you yourself will be the beneficiary of a windfall or a stroke of uncanny luck, but there's a chance that someone close to you will, and his or her good fortune will rub off on you. Are you sufficiently confident in your own worth to let an ally bask in the glory, even though you've played a part in creating that glory? If you are, your rewards will be substantial.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I myself have not played the fantasy role-playing game Nox. From the review of it in Fortean Times, though, I surmise you might want to check it out. It could prepare you well for the coming week--maybe teach you a few tricks that would come in handy. The reviewer of Nox says that in the game you have to weave your way through booby-trapped mazes and haunted libraries as you try to foil the schemes of an evil necromancer. An army of magic spiders may be at your command, but it won't necessarily be of assistance as you wade through a swamp rife with lethal stinking cabbages. Sound familiar?



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Some of the most confounding enigmas about the human condition might be explained if the theory of reincarnation were valid. I invite you to spend the next week trying it on for size. There's no need to become a true believer. Just experiment with the possibility. Imagine that you've lived many times before and will return to Earth in fresh bodies in future centuries. How might a belief in your own immortality change the way you live from day to day? Analyze your recurring dreams, your curious obsessions, and your favorite historical eras for clues to other identities you may have inhabited these last 10,000 years. Halloween costume suggestion: the person you were in a previous incarnation.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us," is the title of a song by the band My Chemical Romance. If you'd like to place yourself in alignment with cosmic rhythms, you should say the exact opposite of that to someone you care about--something like this: "Honey, this mirror is big enough for the two of us, and I want us to gaze into it together." In other words, enlist a loved one to join you in taking an inventory of your relationship. Study how you fit together, and brainstorm about how you can make your connection work even better.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

California's San Joaquin Valley has the worst air in the state, and as a result, 12 percent of the kids who live there have asthma. The terrible pollution stems largely from burned fossil fuels trapped between the mountain ranges that surround the valley. Ironically, the smog often hides the mountains from view. Some environmentalists have made that a symbol of what they hope to accomplish as they strive to purify the air. "Fifteen years from now," one activist told the San Francisco Chronicle, "I have faith that I'll see the mountains." Let this be a metaphor for the work you have ahead of you, Aries. Banish what's obscuring your sight of the big picture.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm afraid I had to name you "Underachiever of the Month" for September, Aries. You didn't quite succeed at wrestling your frustrations into submission, though you had the power to do so. You also failed to cash in on much of the great potential you had for smashing injustice, exposing fakery, and toppling the rotting status quo. That's the bad news. The good news is that some of your missed opportunities will become available again in the coming week. Make up for lost time, please.



Want to hear more about the hidden factors influencing your life in the coming week? Listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In Madison magazine, William Stadiem described Aries actress Robin Wright Penn as "the most beautiful surgically unenhanced woman on screen." I nominate her to be your role model. May she inspire you to reject the pressure to be anything other than exactly who you are. May her example give you the courage to ignore standards of success that don't originate in your own heart.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your adversaries may have a tough time of it in the coming days. I bet their schemes will backfire, their bad hair days will be frequent, their ignorance will be glaringly visible, and the trouble they've caused will be punished. How should you react? You're allowed exactly one hour of gloating. Anything more will put you at risk of becoming more like them, which would be costly. In fact, I urge you to take this opportunity to disengage from them completely. Summon as much love and forgiveness as you can, beam it their way, and then do all you can to free yourself forever of their hold on your emotions and their influence on your actions.



Got enough clues to chew on for a while? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Something we were withholding made us weak," wrote poet Robert Frost. I hope you will consider the possibility that this describes your current predicament. It's my astrological opinion that your strength is being compromised by a feeling you're not exploring or an experience you're denying yourself or a gift you're refusing to give. You may think you're protecting yourself, but I believe it's just the reverse. To reclaim the vitality that has been shriveling up, unclench yourself in every way you can imagine.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When I was 19, a masked gunman pumped a load of buckshot into my hip after a student demonstration. To this day, I have 43 pieces of metal in my body. What kind of metal? That's an important question. Until I find out the answer, I can never get an MRI. Medical technicians tell me that unless they're sure the shards in me aren't the kind of metal that could be moved by the MRI's strong magnetic field, they can't risk it. In a worst-case scenario, the shards might move so much they'd cause internal bleeding. And that's the story of how unknown factors from a past event are still affecting my life today. I believe you're now facing a comparable situation, Aries, though in a more metaphorical way. Go get the answers you need.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Here's how rock critic Aidin Vaziri described the stage set when hip-hop artist 50 Cent played in San Jose: "an urban wasteland that looked like it was designed by Disney (complete with an overturned police car, graffiti-covered trashcans and the decapitated head of the Statue of Liberty)." I hope you don't take this the wrong way, Aries, but there's a certain resemblance between that environment and yours. The so-called chaos you're surrounded by is either imaginary or artificial or both. It may be seductively well-made, and therefore hard to resist, but you can walk away from it any time you choose.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Minnesota radio station KNUJ came up with a unique proposal for how the governor and top legislators could deal with their intractable conflict: They would have a wrestling match in a large vat filled with sauerkraut. I think you should adopt this idea for your own use, Aries--though I suggest that maybe you and your adversary conduct your grapple in a sweeter-smelling substance than fermented cabbage. How about jell-o or pudding, for instance? One way or another, find a constructive way to resolve disagreements or hostilities by using a half-playful, half-serious approach.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's time to play a game called Do-It-Yourself Horoscope! Here's how it works: I provide a skeleton outline of your fortune, and you fill in the blanks. This exercise is designed to boost your self-reliance and compel you to seek answers more aggressively from your inner teacher--skills that are especially important for you to develop right now. Ready? Weave the following threads together to create your oracle. 1) The magic toy is within reach. (2) Sexy heresies are risky and wise. (3) It's good to take liberties as long as you do so with gentle sensitivity. (4) Are you smart enough to be pregnant with well-earned hope? (5) A funky asset is 18 percent larger than normal. (6) The sinewy, supple, serpentine approach will require all your concentration and provide all you need.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You wouldn't plant a rosebush in a spot where a geyser erupts periodically, would you? You wouldn't build a romantic hideaway on the bank of a river that floods every year, right? So please say you won't be careless as you track down the best place to express your love and fertility in the future. Swear to me that you'll research the possibilities with forethought and a passion for detail.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The Drama Queen or Drama King within you is secretly plotting to raise the emotional stakes to record levels. For that inner extremist, mere adventure might not be enough; thunderous histrionics and romantic excess may be considered essential. While I have no problem with you enjoying a fevered fling, I don't think it's necessary to cross the line into delirious hysteria and volcanic excess. So here's what I'm going to suggest: Take your inner Drama Queen or Drama King for about ten rides on an actual roller coaster. That way he or she may not need to make your whole life into a roller coaster.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Have you been dreaming of frogs, worms, and potted plants? Researchers have found that pregnant women have an inordinate number of encounters with those three things during their sleep-time adventures. And while you may not technically be carrying a developing baby inside you, you are at least gestating a brainchild. Like a woman who will give birth in the not-too-distant future, you're both delicate and strong, a bit lumbering but radiantly graceful, sometimes out of sorts but often wiser than you've ever been.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Nitrogen comprises 80 percent of the Earth's atmosphere, but plants can't access it in its gaseous form. That's a problem, because plants need nitrogen to live. Luckily, there are five million lightning strikes on our planet every day. The fierce heat they generate compels nitrogen to blend with oxygen, thereby forming nitrous oxides, which are soluble in water and carried into the ground with the rain. There the plants drink up the nitrogen with ease. The moral of the story, Aries, is that without lightning, there'd be no plants, which means that you are utterly dependent on the lightning for your sustenance. In the coming weeks, you will receive abundant evidence of how much you need metaphorical kinds of lightning as well.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Always star in your own movie," said novelist Ken Kesey. In other words, don't let some charismatic authority or well-meaning companion play the lead role in your great adventure; don't be a supporting actor or actress who only indirectly advances the plot of your life story. This is an ideal time to meditate on this matter for several reasons: 1. You'll soon be given an opportunity to be a hero or heroine. 2. You're showing flashes of star quality. 3. Your creative powers are especially available for use in ripening your fondest dreams.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Professional basketball player Tim Duncan has a nickname that I invite you to take on for the next two weeks: The Big Fundamental. To live up to the daunting yet fun responsibility of that title, you'll have to put on your game face and get waaayyy down to basics. Banish distractions, purge the inessential, and cut the crap. Give yourself with ferocious impeccability to the Three Things That Matter Most, and do it with a raging integrity that will scare away all the phonies, lazybones, and ethically challenged mediocrities.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A reader wrote the following letter to Parade magazine columnist Marilyn vos Savant: "When you're asleep and dreaming about performing calorie-burning activities such as running, jumping, and flying, do you burn more calories in reality as opposed to when you're dreaming about doing something low-impact?" If you wrote me an inquiry like that, Aries, I'd say this: "Yes, definitely. In fact, what you do in your dreams this week will have at least as much impact on your waking life as anything you do in your waking life. Keep a pen and notebook by your bed so you can keep track of late-breaking developments."



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

There are several ways to break an egg. You can knock it against the edge of a pan or strike it with a knife. You can squeeze it hard enough to crack it or hurl it at a disgusting politician. Professional Easter egg painters pierce both ends of it with a needle in order to drain the stuff inside. Is one method better than the others? Not in general, of course, though if you're planning to cook the egg, you shouldn't open it via a high-velocity encounter with the kitchen wall. Your assignment in the coming week, Aries, is to do the metaphorical equivalent of breaking open an egg in a way that's exactly appropriate for how you'll use it.



Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"You always learn your mystery at the price of your innocence," wrote Robertson Davies in Fifth Business. In the coming week, Aries, your assignment is to disprove this assertion. I think it will happen quite naturally; you won't have to exert yourself heroically. In fact, I predict you will demonstrate the exact opposite of Davies' assertion: As you dive deeper into the secrets of your greatest mystery, you will reclaim a lost portion of your innocence.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Taurus musician Willie Nelson is a premier talent. Though described as a country artist, he's really a genre unto himself. During his 50-year career, he has written and recorded many great songs, collaborated with Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, and founded Farm Aid, an organization that raises funds to support family farms. Recently, however, he suffered a disappointment. Republican state senators in Texas shot down a bill that would have named a 49-mile patch of highway after him. They had a problem with the fact that Nelson smokes pot, is an exuberant consumer of alcohol, and supports Democratic candidates. Sound familiar, Taurus? You, too, are in danger of being cheated out of your rightful rewards because of some minor problems. Nelson didn't protest his deprivation, but I think you should fight yours.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Here's your question for the week: What's the difference between deluded self-esteem that leads you to waste your time on impossible dreams and well-justified self-esteem that inspires you to seek a viable goal that's beyond your previous level of accomplishment? An example of the first is the Louisiana State University student who declared himself eligible for the National Basketball Association's draft, although he wasn't even good enough to play on his college team. An example of the second is my talented musician friend Allie, who made a demo CD in her home studio and brazenly sent it to a big record company executive, who liked it so much he signed her to a recording contract.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Your assignment this week, should you choose to accept it, is to outdo the Dullest Blogger in the World. From a command post at www.wibsite.com/wiblog/dull, this mystery figure writes entries like the following: "I was sitting on one of the chairs in my house. My hand was resting on the arm of the chair. I drummed my fingers on the arm, thereby making a barely audible sound . . . I considered playing some music on the stereo system. I looked at some CDs for a while, but didn't put one on." And what, you may ask, is my reasoning for urging you to be more humdrum than this person who is renowned for provoking yawns? The astrological fact of the matter, Cancerian, is that you need to temporarily tone down your excitement levels--way down. Escape the entertaining melodramas for now, and take a rejuvenating excursion into lazy boredom.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

The rules you've been playing by have worked fine for quite a while--not perfectly, but well enough. My sense is that their usefulness is almost at an end, however. Soon they will become counterproductive, no longer bringing out the best in you or the other players. I suggest, therefore, that you change the rules now, before they start undermining everyone. You know that old saw, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it?" This is one time when that advice is wrong.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates is known as the father of medicine. Even today, the approach that he and his followers formulated remains a major influence, epitomized in the Hippocratic Oath sworn by all new doctors. His views on horoscopes might be shocking to some, however. "A physician without a knowledge of astrology," he wrote, "has no right to call himself a physician." I wish modern MDs would take that part of Hippocrates' wisdom as seriously as they do the rest; the art of healing would be more efficacious if it included an understanding of patients' astrological makeup. Now please apply this approach as you revisit the ideas that are at the foundation of what you believe, Virgo. In other words, explore the original sources of your inspiration and education. See if there are vital aspects of the wisdom contained therein that you have missed or ignored.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

As a boy, the renowned Spanish matador Manolete was a sissy. He rarely played outdoors, preferring to be near his mother as he read books and painted pictures. Psychologist James Hillman explains this by suggesting that the youthful Manolete had already sensed his destiny, intuiting that one day he would be alone in the ring facing down angry half-ton bulls. His childhood behavior was a way of marshalling his strength and shielding him from the enormity of the challenges he would seek out one day. Think about how this theme might apply to your own life, Libra. Is it possible that what you have considered one of your weaknesses has actually been preparing you to express tremendous strength?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The only secrets you have to worry about are those you're keeping from yourself. It might be helpful to know what other people are hiding, true, but the only way their covert agendas and sneaky maneuvering can hurt you is if you continue to lie to yourself. Besides, there's just one sure strategy for exposing the secrets that others are keeping: Tell yourself the naked truth about your own feelings and motivations.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

It's Feel Gratitude for Your Ex-Lovers, Old Flames, and Divorced Spouses Week. One of the best ways to celebrate is to stop thinking of your old relationships as failures. Instead, regard them as classrooms where you learned valuable lessons about intimacy. Think of them as practice sessions that helped you figure out what you really want a loving bond to be. Acknowledge the fact that even if you believe your former partners did you wrong, they were great teachers. I urge you to send them thank-you notes, or at least honor their memory with silent bursts of gratitude.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

British medical researchers recently announced that contrary to conventional wisdom, brief periods of stress are healthy for us--so much so that they boost longevity and enhance our cells' ability to repair themselves. At the same time, the scientists emphasized that intense, long-term stress is still just as bad for us as we've always thought. If they're right, Capricorn, you should be the picture of vitality right now. The difficulties you've been facing lately have passed the Goldilocks' test: neither too great nor too small, but just right.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

So you want to move a certain mountain from where it now stands to a place more conveniently located. Is that a worthy project? I don't know. Here's what I do know: The task can be done, but it will take longer than you think. In the early going you may have to work without the best tools and do much of the heavy lifting yourself. In order to succeed, you will also have to develop more stamina than you currently have. But all of these things would actually be very good for you.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In my travels by car, I often see bumper stickers on which parents brag about their offspring. Today I spied both "My child is an honor student at Newbury Middle School" and "My kid beat up an honor student at Newbury Middle School." A new wrinkle also appeared on a third bumper: "I'm the proud parent of a rat terrier." It led me to muse on how everyone has a parental relationship with someone or something. The vulnerable little thing they care for might be a child or pet or houseplant or plot of land, or even a machine or other inanimate object. What about you, Pisces? Whatever it is you take care of, you should concentrate harder on being a good mom or dad in the coming week. Your ward or dependent or prot√©g√© needs you more than usual.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to Steven Johnson's book Everything Bad Is Good for You, TV is making us smarter. He says that shows are becoming increasingly complex in their portrayal of moral dilemmas, demanding that viewers stretch their mental capacities. I don't necessarily buy his arguments, but I do think you'd be smart to imitate his reversal of conventional wisdom. In your own life, an influence you've considered suspect or even negative may soon reveal a benevolent side.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

According to recent polls, people no longer think that most of the old Seven Deadly Sins are even sins, let alone deadly. Greed is the only one of the originals that the majority still regards as worth condemning, while anger, pride, gluttony, sloth, envy, and lust have been demoted to minor lapses. What's your position on the matter, Taurus? It's a perfect time to update your moral values and redefine what it means to be on your best and worst behavior. Why? Because violating your highest standards would be especially costly in the coming weeks, while vigorously upholding your ideals would bring unprecedented rewards.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Important messages will come to you via the wind this week. I mean that literally. You may not be able to receive the full impact of the revelations if you spend too much time indoors, so I suggest that you spend as much time as possible in natural settings. Hike briskly or sit quietly; either approach will work. Empty your mind as best as you can, and attune yourself to the language of the breeze. Be alert for the leaves it blows, the dust it stirs, the sound it makes, the voices in your head it awakens, and anything else it might use to communicate with you.

Let's say, hypothetically speaking, that you went out for a long walk in the woods and got lost. Would you know what to eat in order to avoid starvation? Here's a tip: If your shoes were leather, they'd have sufficient nutritional value to keep you going. And that's a useful metaphor for you to chew on in the coming week, Cancerian. Your current state of affairs has similarities to a meandering ramble through a deep, dark forest. You should be resourceful, even experimental, as you gather the nourishment that will sustain you until you find your way out.

Prince George's County in Maryland is one of the most affluent African American communities in the U.S. While preparing to build 20 new million-dollar homes in the area, a developer recently discovered the ruins of an old slave cabin dating back to the 19th-century. At the urging of historians, he agreed to restore it and make it into a monument for the captive workers who once toiled in the tobacco fields that used to be there. As you rise to a higher level of accomplishment, Leo, you should consider creating a similar memento that will remind you of how far you have come.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In early April, Star Wars devotees began camping out in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. That was where several Star Wars films had debuted, and the fans were sure it would host the May 19th opening of Revenge of the Sith. Soon, however, authoritative sources informed them that there were no plans for the movie to be shown at Grauman's. Refusing to believe it, they dug in for an extended vigil. As it turned out, they were deluded: Seven weeks later, the final installment in the long-running series opened at the ArcLight theater a mile away. Let their actions be a guide for what not to do this week, Virgo. Don't you dare sit and wait for a supposedly glorious event that is in fact never going to happen. Instead, turn your attention to a more modest success, which will occur only if you're not distracted by grandiose visions.

NASA's Deep Impact probe is scheduled to bomb the comet Tempel 1 on July 4. It will then study the dislodged material, which scientists hope will provide clues about the mysteries of the solar system. Meanwhile, Russian astrologer Marina Bai has sued NASA, claiming that a strike on the comet would "disrupt the natural balance of forces in the universe." Personally, I side with NASA, since the data that the probe gathers could help humanity deal with comets on a collision course with the Earth in the future. Besides, disrupting the natural balance of forces in the universe is sometimes the right thing to do. In fact, I recommend that you yourself do just that in the coming week.

Scientists are on the verge of recovering the lost treatises of Archimedes, ancient Greece's most brilliant mathematician. The words were originally inscribed on an old parchment, but were mostly erased in the 12th century by a Christian monk who wasn't interested in math and needed a fresh surface on which to write his prayers. Fragments of the ink that conveyed Archimedes' original thoughts remained, however, and now physicists at Stanford are using a particle accelerator to discern them beneath the newer text. Let this be your guiding metaphor in the coming week, Scorpio. Look for ways to retrieve precious information that has almost disappeared or that is hidden by a source with little meaning to you.

Singer-songwriter Les Lokey has created a host of "brain bombs," provocative slogans she likes to fling in the direction of anyone who needs a hit of inspiration. Since you're in special need of compassionate wake-up calls right now, I've borrowed a few brain bombs for your use. Please carry out as many of the following instructions as you can manage. (1) Combat aggression. (2) Act as if creation is a reconciliation of extremes. (3) Try really, really hard to relax. (4) Be a slave to your free will. (5) Love fiercely. (6) Surrender to excellence. (7) Avoid hardening of the ironies.

Artist Max Ernst (1891-1976) specialized in using creative techniques that relied on the element of chance. He was a master of collage, assembling materials he got from newspapers, botanical drawings, catalogs, and scientific journals. He also liked to run a paintbrush over a piece of a canvas that was lying on a rough wooden floor, thereby making an impression of the underlying texture. This random approach drove some critics crazy, since it undermined the idea that worthwhile art can only be made by trained experts. Ernst seemed to imply that anyone could fabricate interesting stuff. He's your role model right now, Capricorn. Let him inspire you to shed any beliefs you might have that you're not creative. Capitalize on the element of chance to bring novelty into everything you do. Be alert for lucky accidents that you could take advantage of in order to freshen up everyone's perspective.

If you want to buy a personalized jersey at the National Football League's store, there's a list of 1,200 naughty words that you may not have inscribed on the back. The taboo terms include creamy, pearl necklace, magic wand, fondle, glazed donut, lotion, ass clown, tang, got2haveit, love rocket, show time, and get it on. It so happens that you would be wise to make liberal use of all these concepts and others like them in the coming week, at least according to my astrological analysis. I hope you weren't planning to order a personalized NFL jersey.

Indescribable happiness is now available if you'll melt down your ego in service to love. The object of your adoration may be a special person, a beloved animal or place, or anything that stirs you to lose yourself in life's sweetest mysteries. For best results, heed these words from David Deida: "Give yourself to love itself, without a shred of you remaining. Die completely into loving. When you return, when your sense of self is recollected, you will be refreshed through and through, washed awake by the innocence lying wide on the other side of surrender."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Maybe all you really need right now is a grilled cheese sandwich. It's quite possible that if you savor a well-made version of that earthy delicacy, the things that are off-kilter in your life will get smooth and fresh again. I'm not kidding, Aries. The adjustment that will help you get back on track is likely to be minor--if not a grilled cheese sandwich, then maybe a haircut or a new bedspread or a five-minute conversation that corrects a misimpression. That reminds me of another secret I want to tell you: Small actions can have big impacts.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The only work that will have lasting value in the coming week is work that you do in the spirit of fun. If you approach any task with nothing more than a desire to get it over with, it will ultimately be useless. If you perform a good deed merely out of a sense of duty, it won't bestow any of its intended benefits. These directions apply to the effort you put into your relationship, hobby, or art as well as to your actions on the job. Success depends on you playing hard with your spontaneity fully engaged.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Twenty-nine-year-old Gemini actor Colin Farrell recently reached out to an older woman--a *much* older woman. While working on the film *Ask the Dust,* he made a prolonged attempt to seduce one of his fellow stars, Dame Eileen Atkins, who was 69 years old at the time. Though she was flattered, she turned him down. In the coming week, Gemini, I urge you to try a more elevated version of Farrell's quest. Seek intimate contact with an influence that will bless you with the sexy powers of age, wisdom, and experience.

The state of New Hampshire's symbol used to be the Old Man of the Mountain. Carved from rock by a glacier 30,000 years ago, it was a series of granite ledges that jutted out of a mountain in the shape of an old man's face. It was a top tourist attraction, and its image appeared on numerous state souvenirs. But in May 2003, it collapsed overnight, weakened by millennia of freezing and thawing. According to my reading of the astrological omens, Cancerian, this event has resemblances to an imminent disintegration in your own life. Like the original, your experience might be sad, but mostly for nostalgic reasons. No one will get hurt, and ultimately you'll feel exhilarated as you pick a new symbol to inspire you.

Can you name ten different beer brands but none of the Ten Commandments? That's one of 25 signs that you will ultimately go to hell, according to divinity professor Jacob Pinewood, quoted in the *Weekly World News.* Here are other behaviors that may cause you eternal damnation: using the F word more than once a day; coveting your neighbor's household appliances; watching five consecutive hours of TV; invoking the Lord's name in vain when you stub your toe; and mentally undressing any person who would be bad for you to get naked with. Luckily for you, Leo, you're now in an astrological phase when engaging in the above actions will *not* earn you a trip to the infernal regions. That's because you're in an unprecedented grace period when you have slack to burn. If I were you, though, I'd use my karmic credit more constructively than simply getting away with naughty things.

Janael Lee is a math teacher who suffers from muscular dystrophy and moves around with the aid of a scooter. Last January she was named Ms. Wheelchair Wisconsin, and began to work as an advocate for disabled people. A few months later, however, officials stripped her of her crown after a newspaper photo showed her standing up, which she does now and then for brief periods. "We can¬ít have title holders out there walking when they¬íre seen in public," the officials said. I believe you will soon experience a comparable demotion, Virgo. Maybe you used to be suited for a certain role that has cast you as an underdog, but you're too strong and healthy for that now.

"Consistency is a highly overrated virtue," wrote William Falk in *The Week.* "I¬ím not ashamed to admit that I no longer believe half of what I was sure of ten years ago. You make mistakes, you get new information, you change your mind along the way. It¬ís a natural process." I urge you to write out the preceding statement and tape it to your mirror or phone for the next seven days. You're in an astrological phase when you have everything to gain from changing your mind in a hundred different ways. I dare you to see what life is like when it's not filtered through your familiar opinions and theories.

Last February, three people got lost while riding their mountain bikes in California's San Bernardino National Forest. Luckily, they were rescued by emergency workers before any harm came to them. But the next day they returned to the woods to look for their bikes and got lost a second time. Again, help arrived in time, and they were escorted to safety. Don't be like them in the coming days, Scorpio. You're allowed to wander off-course and get saved once, but don't make the same mistake twice.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Sometimes the best gift you can give your ego is to tell it you're not going to be its slave anymore. You say to it, "I'm tired of being whipped around by every one of your ever-shifting little needs, and I'm sick of having to kowtow to your inexhaustible demands, and I want to be free of your insatiable craving to be appreciated, recognized, and adored. Go away and leave me alone. I'm just going to be who I am without worrying about you at all." Delivering this message often has a radically healing effect. Your ego gets shocked into a state of humility, and you get to do what your soul has been longing to do. Ironically, this often results in you creating changes that make your ego very happy.

A maintenance worker at a restaurant in Queensland, Australia took the lazy way out when he found a dead rat while painting the floor red. Rather than disposing of it, he simply covered it with a few thick strokes of his brush. During a subsequent inspection, however, health inspectors weren't fooled by the partial camouflage and levied large fines on the restaurant. You may soon be tempted to try something similar to what the maintenance worker did, Capricorn. I urge you not to. Don't just try to disguise what's stinking up the place; get rid of it.

I live pretty simply, and often have an allergic reaction in the presence of people who have their own jet airplanes, travel with personal servants and style consultants, drink $300-a-bottle champagne, and vacation in palatial spas on private islands. Having said that, I am duty-bound to report that you now have an astrological mandate to indulge in as much extravagant pleasure as you can afford. Your watchword for the week comes from Frank Lloyd Wright: "Give me the luxuries of life and I will willingly do without the necessities."



Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I invite you to try an exercise in creative pretending. Ready? In all the ways you can imagine, stop thinking that you're outside, and instead visualize yourself as inside. In other words, suppress your tendency to fantasize that the good stuff is out of reach and hard to get. Picture yourself as being right in the midst of it. End your sense of exile and come all the way in to the heart of every matter. If you do this meditation ten minutes a day for the next seven days, by this time next week the world will already be changing to match the vision you've been building.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope.

A judge in Los Angeles was peeved when a potential juror let out a loud yawn during the jury selection process. "I'm sorry, but I'm really bored," the man confessed. The judge found him in contempt and fined him $100. Similarly, Aries, the universe will find you in contempt if you let yourself get sucked into activities that dull your senses, shut down your curiosity, or numb your lust for life. This week it's your sacred duty to seek out only the most interesting stimuli.

Most towns in Ghana have no street names, and the houses have no numbers. It's hard to find where people live if you've never visited them before. This is a good metaphor for an issue I want to bring to your attention, Taurus. There's a certain part of your life that has never been mapped, let alone organized. And yet it's not at all wild; in fact, it's like a bustling village where the streets have no names. It's high time you brought some order and discipline to this place.

Research on newly discovered fragments of ancient New Testament texts reveals that Christian fundamentalists have been working under an erroneous assumption. The number of the Beast is not 666, as right-wing prophets of the apocalypse have long believed. The correct figure is actually 616. I mention this, Cancerian, because your ideas about enemies and evil are also about to undergo a revision. Freed from an illusion, you will at first be sad, then relieved, then confused, then elated.

I have a dream that in the New World, everyone will be paid in direct proportion to how much beauty they create. There'll be an affirmative action program that ultimately makes most of us celebrities. Buddhist real estate developers will build a chain of sacred shopping centers in the heartland. The CEOs of the richest companies will be required by law to enjoy once-a-week sessions with Jungian psychotherapists. In the New World, April Fool¬ís Day will come once a month. There¬íll be scientific horoscopes and mystical logic. Every one of us will have at least one imaginary friend. Compassion will be an aphrodisiac. Pioneers in artificial intelligence will develop computers that can talk to God. That's my vision of the New World, Leo. What's yours? It's a perfect moment to imagine your personal vision of utopia.

You've probably never heard of one of the greatest heroes of the last 100 years. Virgo microbiologist Maurice Hilleman (1919-2005) developed vaccines for measles, pneumonia, meningitis, hepatitis, and many other diseases. The Guardian said he saved more lives in the 20th century than anyone else. And yet, as is all-too-typical for Virgos, he never got anywhere near the acclaim he deserved. Having said that, I believe the coming weeks will depart from the astrological norm. Many of you Virgos will get much more of the recognition and rewards you have earned but never before received.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

We're all in the closet in one way or another. Every one of us feels that there's some part of ourselves we've got to hide; that if we reveal the totality of who we really are, we will suffer. For example, U.S. Army Sgt. Robert Stout, who was wounded and got a Purple Heart for his service in Iraq, ultimately decided he was tired of being secret about his homosexuality. As a result, he can't re-enlist, even though he'd like to. My psychotherapist friend Alicia has always used astrology in her practice, but only recently chose to be open about it. Some of her colleagues broke off relations when she told them. According to my reading of the omens, Libra, it's an ideal time to carefully come out of whatever closet you've been in. I'm not saying there'll be no repercussions; just that you'll have clarity and strength as you deal with them. And the freedom you create with your brave revelation will change everything for the better.

One of Sesame Street's most recognizable characters is Cookie Monster. After years of feasting on all the cookies he wanted, the fuzzy blue puppet has recently been forced to limit his intake. In an effort to teach kids better eating habits, the show's producers even require Cookie Monster to sing a song called, "A Cookie Is a Sometimes Food." I vociferously protest this action. Born November 2, Cookie Monster is a Scorpio, and Scorpios shouldn't be compelled to tone down their desires as long as their desires aren't hurting anyone. You're on this earth to explore your cravings, to be led by your cravings to the frontiers of understanding. That's the only way they can teach you all they have to teach. Now go and commune with as many cookies (or your personal equivalent) as you need to.

In the film 3-Iron, a man and woman meet and become lovers without ever speaking. They maintain their perfect silence even as they glide through a series of adventures, forging a sly, resilient harmony. Their romance provides a "fresh, confident vision of love as a kind of Buddhist refuge," reported The Week. While I don't recommend that you take up their model of intimacy forever, Sagittarius, I do think it's a perfect time to try it out for a brief period. Do you dare? Spend a day or even a few hours with the person you're closest to without ever saying a word to each other. (Nonsense sounds are permissible.)

California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has no tolerance for his children's carelessness with their dirty clothes. His wife Maria Shriver says that if he finds the kids' pajamas and t-shirts lying around, he simply burns them. I urge you to take a page out of the Terminator's book, Capricorn. It's an excellent time to throw parts of your wardrobe into the fire--especially things that may still look OK but no longer suit your style. You know what I mean: the clothes that remind you of the person you used to be but no longer are. Once you've got the blaze started, why not fling in a bunch of other stuff that's outdated, worn out, and weighing you down?

Last fall, millions of Ukrainians waged the "orange revolution." Wearing orange scarves as their symbol of solidarity, they peacefully overturned the results of the rigged presidential election. Citizens of the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia had their own nonviolent insurrection in 2003, wielding bouquets of roses as they toppled their chief tyrant during the "rose revolution." I hereby proclaim the coming week to be the launch of the Aquarian tribe's "seed revolution." Inspired by the metaphor of the seed, you will weed out the rotting status quo and plant your seed-like ideas everywhere you go. Carry a packet of seeds with you at all times. What kind? Doesn't matter: pumpkin, wildflower, magic beans, or anything that excites your imagination.

In 2004 the U.S. federal government gave $2.2 billion to the 50 states, directing them to spend the money to defend against terrorism. So far, though, 86 percent of the donation remains unused. Many of the states can't seem to decide how to allocate the funds. This problem reminds me of a situation in your life, Pisces. You, too, have been blessed with a sizable endowment that you have not taken full advantage of. Is this the week you change all that? It might help to figure out the reasons why you have not yet understood the true purpose of gift.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The advice I have for you may not go over well with the part of you that's prone to acting like a battering ram. Nevertheless, I'm convinced it's the correct thing to do, so please suppress your head-butting instincts for now, and heed these bits of wisdom from ancient Chinese philosopher Lao-Tsu. 1. "The softest thing in the universe overcomes the hardest thing in the universe." 2. "In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water. Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In my astrological opinion, it's time to make some radical new promises to yourself. What acts of ingenious love do you vow to carry out in the months to come? I'll offer a few suggestions; feel free to dream up 20 more. Say this aloud: "I will never forsake, betray, or deceive myself. I will always adore, forgive, and believe in myself. I will never ignore, belittle, or underestimate myself. I will always amuse, delight, and redeem myself."



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Having a wing-span of almost three feet, the ivory-billed woodpecker was a beauty that once thrived in the hardwood forests of the southern U.S. Native Americans believed the bird's ivory bill had magical powers. They used it as currency and made it into crowns worn by great warriors. Sadly, the species has been thought extinct since 1944, when the last of its kind disappeared. But a month ago, conservationists announced a great reversal of fortunes: Several ivory-bills have recently been spotted in the Arkansas woods. You should regard this as a metaphor for events unfolding in your own life, Gemini. Magic that you thought was gone forever is returning.

It's graduation time for you, Cancerian. Maybe you're finishing up work at an actual school, or maybe your classroom has been in the streets, but in any case you're completing lessons you've been studying for many moons. Personally, I've enjoyed watching you work. It has been a pleasure seeing you evolve from an innocent amateur into a proficient veteran without losing your purity. As you journey on to your next challenge, I hope you'll find a way to use the expertise you've developed even as you cultivate maximum curiosity about the next frontier.

Andrea Levy never read a book until she was 23 and didn't start writing until her mid-30s. Now 49, she's the author of four books, including Small Island, which in 2004 won three major awards in her native Britain. She's your role model for the next four weeks, Leo. What natural talent have you failed to develop so far? Let Levy inspire you to shed your regret about it and dive in to a new era of full engagement.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Nearly half of American high school students believe that the government should have the power to censor the news. Surveys also show that a majority of adults in the U.S. would vote against the Bill of Rights if it were presented to them in a referendum. Don't be anything like those wackos in the coming days, Virgo. On the contrary, you should fight for all the freedom you can imagine, including the freedom of other people as well as your own. Be an expert in liberation.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

There is no God. God is dead. God is a drug for people who aren¬ít very smart. God is an illusion sold to dupes by exploitative religions. God is a right-wing conspiracy. God is an infantile fantasy clung to by superstitious cowards who can¬ít face life¬ís existential meaninglessness. JUST KIDDING! In fact, anyone who says she knows what God is or isn¬ít, doesn¬ít. That's why I suggest that you confess what you don¬ít know about God. If you do, ironically, you'll get a direct bolt of communication from God Herself. Now read Adolfo Quezada's prayer: "God of the Wild, you are different from what I expected. I cannot predict you. You are too free to be captured for the sake of my understanding. I can't find you in the sentimentalism of religion. You are everywhere I least expect to find you. You are not the force that saves me from the pain of living; you are the force that brings me life even in the midst of pain."

Here's your dream dictionary for the coming week. If you have a dream of walking through the mist at dawn and coming upon flamingos nesting in a rusty red 1959 Cadillac convertible in a junkyard, it means you should expand your ideas about where you might find beauty. A dream of baking a birthday cake for Buddha in the kitchen of a ship passing through the Panama Canal means you¬íre primed to upgrade your skill at expressing generosity. A dream of finding traces of marijuana in a seventeenth-century pipe found in the house where William Shakespeare lived means you should rethink your ideas about where your best inspiration comes from. A dream of a driver who doesn't use his turn signal means you shouldn't follow anyone too closely. (P.S. Even if you don't have the dreams I described, you should still heed the counsel they provide.)

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

It's the beginning of the upside-down and backwards time of year for you, Sagittarius. As long as you cooperate with the unusual flow of fate, you will thrive. Here are some exercises to get you in the proper frame of mind: Picture yourself having the body of the opposite gender. Hold a pen with your non-dominant hand as you write about your taboo fantasies. Gaze at yourself in a mirror that reflects your image from another mirror.  Consider the possibility that there¬ís something you really need but you don¬ít know what it is. Make up a dream in which you change into an animal. Compose a prayer in which you ask for something you think you¬íre not supposed to.

Viticulturists have noticed that wine often tastes better if the soil where the grapevines are planted is less than top quality. It seems that when the grapes have to work harder to flourish, they're more robust. I foresee a similar situation for you in the coming weeks, Capricorn. The growing conditions might be less than optimal, but I bet the stuff you produce will be extraordinary.

Dusty Baker, manager of baseball's Chicago Cubs, got frustrated with the numerous health problems of his players and how long it was taking for them to recover. Turning to alternate approaches, he acquired some holy water and applied it to selected injuries. "I just hope my sinning doesn't negate the effectiveness of it," he agonized. If he had only consulted the famous Chicago-area medical intuitive Caroline Myss, he wouldn't have worried. She has made it clear that one doesn't have to be a highly evolved paragon of enlightenment in order to ease suffering and bestow blessings. Let that be your watchword in the coming week, Aquarius. You will have enormous powers to help and heal, even if a couple of your flaws might be hanging out.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I am absolutely democratic and non-hierarchical. In my view, no one is more important than anyone else in the big scheme of things. God has an equal love for Paris Hilton, the Dalai Lama, and Ahmed, the clerk at the convenience store where I buy gas. Every single person's role is crucial to the unfolding of evolution. I urge you to meditate on the possibility that this perspective is true, Pisces. Be especially eager to discover what it might mean for how you live your life from day to day. Here's one implication, articulated by Martin Luther King Jr.: "If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven played music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For all I know, you may someday author a book called How To Attract Your Very Own Millionaire Spirit Guide. If you do, you will begin writing it during an astrological phase much like the one you're in now. In fact, it could even be this week. You're more aligned with the cosmic cash flow than you have been in a long time; you're more likely than usual to stumble upon dumb financial luck and generate money mojo. See if you can hear the whispers of that millionaire spirit guide as you fall asleep tonight.

Christians in Denmark celebrate communion the way it's done in many other places: They eat a flat, tasteless wafer that symbolizes the body of Christ. Soon that may change, however. Some of the nation's best bakers have embarked on a campaign to whip up more delectable versions of the traditional host. This developing story reminds me of your current state, Taurus. It's a perfect moment for you to spice up a bland ritual, to get more thrills from a duty you regard as important, or to add variety to a sacred task you've done the same way for a long time.

Larry Colvin, a prisoner in North Carolina's Buncombe Correctional Center, was scheduled to finish his four-month sentence last March 16. But just a few hours before his official release, he escaped. There's no word yet on whether he has been recaptured, but you can bet that when he is, the legal system will return him to jail for more than a few hours. Let this serve as a model for what not to do, Gemini. It would be crazy for you to try to wiggle out of your ongoing ordeal now that you're so close to its end. Endure the remaining time with poise and patience, studying its lessons until the lessons are truly done. It'll all be over soon.

It's the Fertile Inquiry time of year for you, Cancerian. The more questions you ask yourself, the better you'll feel. Here are a few to get you started. What do you want to be when you grow up? Are you prepared to start nurturing yourself as well as you nurture others? When will you dismantle the barriers within you that prevent those who love you from loving you with all their power? Are you finally ready to act on the understanding that home is not just a building, but a state of mind, and that you need to work harder to foster that state?

Our goal is to rouse you out of your rut by any means necessary. I think the best way to do that is by stirring up a lot of wicked fun. It's certainly far superior to waiting around for a stroke of fate to kick your ass. So please undertake an aggressive plan that includes activities like these: Put on an inflatable sumo wrestler costume and play a bagpipe as badly as possible; write a love letter to your evil twin; see how far you can spit a mouthful of expensive wine; mix stripes with plaids, cashmere with polyester, and yellowish-green with reddish-purple; organize a party in which you and your friends act out scenes from your favorite TV show; make believe you are the ocean king or thunder queen; meditate naked under a waterfall.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

As public schools decline and private schools become more expensive, increasing numbers of parents are homeschooling their children. I predict that an analogous phenomenon will arise among religious groups. Called the "homechurch" movement by Christians, "homesynagogue" by Jews, and "hometemple" by other traditions, it will consist of people creating altars and conducting worship sessions in their own abodes. Seekers pursuing this approach will eliminate the middlemen and serve as their own priests, priestesses, and rabbis. If you have even the slightest attraction to this meme, Virgo, launch your own version of it. It's time to crank up your spiritual intentions. The Divine Wow wants to talk.

[Caution: Information in this horoscope contains references to exotic sexual practices. If you might be offended, stop reading now. I present this material because you are in a heightened state of arousal, both physically and metaphysically, and could benefit from outrageous provocations as you rethink your approach to intimate acts of love.] The ladybird beetle copulates for up to nine hours at a time, and males may have three 90-minute orgasms in one session. Bonobo apes are not obsessed with orgasm, but have frequent erotic exchanges of every variety, from intercourse to mutual masturbation to oral sex; homosexual contact is common. The male sponge louse disguises himself as a female to aid his seduction strategies. As soon as praying mantises begin coitus, the female bites off the male's head and eats it; sex continues, however. The slime mold comes in 500 genders, and at least 13 of these have to collaborate in order to have a successful mating session.

Would you like to transform yourself from being a slave of your desires into being a master? It's a perfect time to work on that worthy project. Here's what you should do: 1. Keep talking yourself out of being attached to trivial goals and keep talking yourself into being thrilled about the precious few goals that are really important. 2. Whenever you are overwhelmed by a desperate longing to be loved, transform the feeling into a fierce determination to give love lavishly.

Your fellow Sagittarius Ludwig van Beethoven created sublime music under trying conditions. He was often in poor health, struggled financially, never found love, suffered from depression, and became deaf, yet somehow became one of the greatest composers in history. As you finish up this arduous phase of your own cycle, he's your official role model. Let him inspire you to produce small miracles even in the face of puzzling difficulties. If necessary, resort to what Beethoven often did to stimulate his creativity: Pour a bucket of ice water over your head. It might also help to know that Goethe described our hero as "completely untamed." Do you think that quality had something to do with his high level of attainment?

Scientists believe that sooner or later they will figure out why cancer cells are virtually immortal, and then apply that understanding to keeping normal cells alive much longer, thereby dramatically extending the human life span. I believe you have an analogous opportunity right now, Capricorn: If you decode the success formula of a nemesis, you will give yourself a tremendous boon that will boost your vitality and expressiveness.

For one week, Aquarius, consider suspending your fascination with the shock of the new. Instead, steep yourself in the subtle teachings of the old. Seek out elders who haven't lost their spark and ask them humble questions about your most enduring mysteries. Read books and listen to music and watch movies whose creators have been dead for at least 50 years. Muse about what you were doing in mid-May of 1993. Make a shrine on which you put an image of an ancestor, a leaf from a tree that began growing before you were born, and a symbol of a goal you gave up long ago.

One of the world's longest streets is Figueroa Street in Los Angeles. It runs 30 miles. In contrast, Bridge Street, a lane near my house, is about 50 yards long and connects two lengthy roads to each other. The path you're on right now, Pisces, has a metaphorical resemblance to Bridge Street. Your time on it will be brief, and it will serve as a bridge between two phases of your life story. Soon you'll turn onto a longer thoroughfare more like Figueroa. In the meantime, pay maximum attention to the sights and sounds. This leg of your journey will be short, but it will reveal clues that will be essential as you shift gears.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The planning for a typical wedding lasts from 7 to 12 months. Getting ready for the birth of a child usually requires every minute from the time people find out they're pregnant until the delivery day. I foresee you experiencing an event in early 2006 that will resemble both of these happy yet challenging events. It might be something like the birth or dramatic renewal of a relationship. Or it could be the launch of a partnership that will ask everything of you, and give just as much. I suggest you start your preparations.

On a family member's 60th birthday, the Japanese celebrate a holiday known as kanreki. It's a time of rebirth, when the celebrant ritually becomes a baby again and enters a second childhood. Among the many gifts given on the occasion is a red kimono, which signifies that in a sense the person is now freed from the responsibilities of adulthood. I recommend that you treat yourself to a similar rite of passage, Taurus. Even though you may not be turning 60, you are at the beginning of an extraordinarily fresh new cycle. You deserve a red kimono and at least a temporary respite from adult burdens.

It's time to declare amnesty for the part of you that you don't love very well. Forgive that poor sucker. Hold its hand and take it out to dinner and a movie. Tactfully offer it a chance to make amends for the dumb things it has done. And then do a dramatic reading of this proclamation by the playwright Theodore Rubin:  "I must learn to love the fool in me--the one who feels too much, talks too much, takes too many chances, wins sometimes and loses often, lacks self-control, loves and hates, hurts and gets hurt, promises and breaks promises, laughs and cries. It alone protects me against that utterly self-controlled, masterful tyrant whom I also harbor and who would rob me of human aliveness, humility, and dignity but for my fool."

Every hundred years, says a Scottish myth, a scrap of paradise appears on earth for just one day. Hidden from the profane world for decades at a time, this little town, known as Brigadoon, briefly materializes out of the mists, becoming accessible to any lucky person who happens by. I predict that something resembling Brigadoon will appear to many members of the Cancerian tribe in the coming week. To increase your chances for being in the right place at the right time, you should not simply follow your heart. Rather, follow the most audacious impulses of your heart, radiate mischievous warmth, and be vigilant with your peripheral vision.

According to legend, influential blues guitarist Robert Johnson made a pact with the Devil in a crossroads. In exchange for his soul, the Devil gave him tremendous musical skill, including an unparalleled ability to affect his audiences emotionally. I predict that you will soon be tempted to negotiate a comparable deal in a crossroads, Leo. Please keep in mind that there will be some extremely fine print in the proposed contract. Besides that, I want you to know that while the progress you'd make with the Devil's help may initially be faster, in the long run it wouldn't be anywhere near as great as what you can accomplish without it.

Of all the world's landlocked countries, only one maintains a navy: Bolivia. Until 1879, it had a seaport, but lost it in a war with Chile. Over a century later, it has thousands of sailors but only a single sea-worthy ship, which it keeps docked in Argentina a thousand miles away. Its quixotic fixity of purpose seems to be a symbolic declaration that it intends to someday once again have land bordering the ocean. I see a certain resemblance between Bolivia and you right now, Virgo. You also cling fiercely to a starry-eyed commitment that might appear unrealistic to casual observers. The difference is that your dream, as opposed to Bolivia's, is not entirely hopeless. You will receive a sign this week that reveals why.

"The proverb warns that 'You should not bite the hand that feeds you.' But maybe you should, if it prevents you from feeding yourself." So said the critic of psychiatry, Thomas Szasz. He was urging us to think about how our dependence on seemingly benevolent providers might paralyze our free will and interfere with our ability to take care of ourselves. In the song, "The Hand That Feeds," Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails expresses a further doubt about the proverb. He suggests the hand that feeds us may supply us with stuff that doesn't really nourish us and that is tainted by the supplier's questionable motivations. "Will you stay down on your knees," he sings, or "will you bite the hand that feeds you?" I present these views for your consideration, Libra. It's a good time to re-evaluate your relationship with authorities who purport to be helping you.

For about half the year, Cambodia's Tonle Sap River flows north. Soon after the beginning of the rainy season, however, it reverses its direction and flows south for six months. I bring this up, Scorpio, because the astrological omens suggest that you're now in a phase comparable to the time when the river makes its turnaround. The experience may feel a bit odd at first, but it's completely natural. Go with the opposite flow.

History's longest conflict between nations was the Hundred Years' War, which England and France fought for 116 years between 1337 and 1453. The shortest war ever was between Zanzibar and England in 1896. It lasted 38 minutes. Whether the hostilities you enter into in the coming week will resemble the former or the latter may all depend on two factors: 1. how open you are to learning from the other side; 2. how willing you are to acknowledge your own role in creating the circumstances that led to the dispute.

Studies show that judicious chocolate consumption promotes longevity. People who ingest it three times a month are more likely to live into their 90s than those who either refrain from eating it or else gorge on it frequently. The astrological omens suggest, however, that your health will be well-served by eating 300 percent more than the judicious amount this May, beginning with a virtual orgy of chocolate feasting this week. I recommend that you also seek out other experiences that generate feelings similar to those stirred by a chocolate feast.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

You now have the power to modify three situations that are overdue for change. First, you could heal a nagging ailment. Second, you could expand your awareness so much that you will detect an important fact about your life that you've been oblivious to. Third, you could end your preoccupation with a trivial problem, thereby freeing up energy to be used for the first two tasks. But none of these things will transpire, Aquarius, if you merely think about them and talk about them. You need a special kind of jolt that bypasses your rational faculties: a new medicine song. So call on all your resources--friends with vast musical knowledge, Web radio stations like Radio Paradise or 3WK, the playlists of people whose taste you like--to track down the tune that will rejuvenate your soul. (Here's one suggestion: "Stones" by Sonic Youth.)

Sniffing basil and rosemary can make your thinking processes more agile and effective, say aromatherapists. You probably won't really need any such boost in the coming week, though, since according to the astrological omens your mental faculties will be at their peak. But on the other hand, why not go for the super-brain effect? If you feed the odors of basil and rosemary to your already dexterous mind, you may break through into a new order of intelligence, allowing you to solve puzzles that have confounded you for months.

A huge supply of frozen natural gas lies beneath the oceans. Researchers have just begun to develop the technology to mine it. When they succeed, civilization will gain access to more energy than is available from all the world's oil reserves. This tantalizing prospect reminds me of your situation, Aries. You're sitting on a reserve of metaphorical fuel that could power your efforts for quite some time. Now all you have to do is figure out a way to get at it.

Even if you're not an artist, you're a creator. You're constantly hatching new plans, coming up with fresh ideas, and shifting your approach to everything you do. It's to this part of you--the restless, inventive spirit--that I address the following: It's a perfect time for you to cultivate increased respect and reverence for your creativity. Tap in to the dormant potential of your amazing imagination. Feel confident about your ability to generate novelty. Realize how much power you have to change anything you want to change. Here's your inspirational motto, courtesy of sculptor Constantin Brancusi: "Create like God, command like a king, work like a slave."

A lot of antifreeze tastes sweet even though it's toxic. That's a big problem for dogs and children, who sometimes come upon spilled or open containers of antifreeze and drink it. New Mexico is one of the first places in the world to pass a law making it mandatory for antifreeze to be bitter-tasting, thus discouraging innocents from imbibing it. This should serve as a metaphor for you in the coming week, Gemini. Your inner child or inner pet may be drawn to ingesting experiences that are delectable but noxious. Have your inner adult take steps to ensure this won't happen.

Just make sure that you're always motivated more by fun and idealism than by self-aggrandizement. It's time to use all your tricks and call on all the favors you're owed as you sell your self without selling your soul.

You've been given a prophetic glimpse of the great victory that's possible. You're very close to neutralizing an old bugaboo and making sure that the past will no longer hold you back. Now comes the hardest part: Will you be able to sustain your concentration until the triumphs are actually accomplished? Or will you be lulled into lazy complacency by the sense of security that your partial breakthroughs have provided? Personally, I believe you will summon the dogged ingenuity necessary to finish the job; you will turn almost into completely.

If I were going to write a fairy tale about the current state of your life, I would say that your stolen treasure is locked away in a heart-shaped metal box at the top of a glass mountain. You have every right to steal it back, but you haven't been able to get to it. The surface of the mountain is too slippery for you to climb. In the next chapter of the fairy tale, you will encounter an elf or dwarf or witch who has a pair of special shoes with suction cups that could allow you to scale the peak. But you will have to give something in return for those shoes. And here's the tricky part: The elf or dwarf or witch may not tell you exactly what he or she wants; you might have to guess.

They complain that dismantling the barriers between the eastern and western portions of the country has led to economic turmoil in both areas. I mention this, Libra, because I think it resembles a feeling you're currently harboring. A part of you is longing for the bad old days when a now-defunct obstacle was a fixture in your life. You're romanticizing the protection that the obstacle offered and forgetting how oppressive and limiting it was. It's OK to entertain the fantasy of restoring the wall--in fact, I recommend that you do--but don't you dare actually restore it.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

For a limited time only, everything will be pretty much the reverse of what it usually is. Do you have an unlucky number? In the coming week, that number will be a sign that good fortune is nearby. Do you have qualities that you regard as weak or undeveloped? You can now make them work to your advantage. What are the things you're afraid of? Deal frankly with them and you will stimulate a big boost in your courage. Are you weary of worrying about your enemies? They are about to become great teachers, maybe even helpers.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You're entering into the thick of the problem-solving phase of your astrological cycle, Sagittarius. Your dilemmas are probably heating up, becoming more frustrating and time-consuming. What's more important to know, however, is that you now have a heightened power to fix those dilemmas. In fact, I predict that soon after reading this horoscope, you'll find you have access to unprecedented levels of wild but disciplined determination. As you go about your work, keep in mind Buckminster Fuller's standard for measuring his effectiveness: "When I am working on a problem," he said, "I never think about beauty. I think only of how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong."

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

You may have trophies, merit badges, and plaques to commemorate your sexual accomplishments, Capricorn. You may have a PhD in tantra and letters from past lovers testifying to your excellence as an erotic partner. Nevertheless, I believe you have more to learn. There are frontiers you have not yet explored. And this is the perfect time for you to push to the next level. Open your mind and heart to the possibility that you're ready to upgrade the way you stir up emotion-enriching, soul-expanding bliss.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

I was looking for a house to rent. A real estate manager gave me a tour of various houses that were available. At one place the occupants weren't home, but the manager had the key to the door and permission to enter. As she led me around, we came upon the master bedroom. A huge German shepherd was on the bed. I reflexively withdrew, afraid the dog would attack the strangers in its house. But it didn't bark, pounce, or even growl. On the contrary, it shivered with fear. Its protective instincts seemed paralyzed. I think the dog's behavior was an apt metaphor for the current state of your own inner guardian, Aquarius--you know, the fierce part of your psyche that defends your interests. It's unnaturally timid and hesitant, and is thus not primed to do its job properly. Do whatever it takes to cure it of its malaise.

After rejecting proposals from many directors, Bob Dylan has finally authorized Oscar-nominated Todd Haynes to make a film about his life. Seven different actors will portray Dylan, including a black woman. "I am setting out to explode the idea that anybody can be depicted in a single self," Haynes told The Sunday Times. You already explode that idea every week of your life, Pisces, and you will be exploding it with even greater force and style in the coming days. I encourage you to be proud of your own riotous multiplicity. It's something to be celebrated, not to be shy about. Why not fantasize about the seven actors and actresses you'd choose to play you in the movie about your life?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong tells this story: "A guy walks up to me and says, 'What's punk?' I kick over a garbage can and say, 'That's punk.' So the guy kicks over a garbage can and says, 'That's punk?' And I say 'No, that's trendy.'" Keep this tale in mind in the coming week, Aries. There's no need and no excuse for you to be like the trendy guy. You should be like Billie Joe, the one who kicks over the garbage can the first time.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Traditional astrologers say Tauruses are rampant materialists. While it's true that members of your sign often have a robust relationship with money, I find that many of you also have a refined and vigorous appreciation of beauty. In fact, I think an aesthetically pleasing environment is crucial for your mental and spiritual health. In the coming week, you should devote extra time and care to this need. Purge ugliness from your surroundings. Introduce elements that excite your eye and stimulate your imagination. Your symbol of power: the thousand-year-old rose bush that grows next to the wall of Germany's Hildesheim Cathedral.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

For one week, try this exercise: Each night before you fall asleep, review the day's activities in your mind's eye. As if watching a movie about yourself, strive to be calmly objective as you observe your memories from the previous 16 hours. Be especially alert for moments when you strayed from your purpose and didn't live up to your highest standards. If you're feeling adventurous, I also recommend that you spend a day doing a review of all of your life's highlights since your last birthday. Pick a time when you have a few hours to spare, lie back and close your eyes, and watch with compassionate gratitude as the amazing plot lines unfold.

"Creativity is like driving a car at night," said E. L. Doctorow. "You never see further than your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way." I would add that life itself is also like driving a car at night. You're pretty much in the dark all the time except for what's right in front of you. Or at least that's usually the case. But for a few shining hours in the coming week, Cancerian, I believe you'll be able to see the big picture of where you're headed. It will be as if the whole world is suddenly illuminated by a prolonged burst of light; as if you're both driving your car and also watching your journey from high above.

Actress Lara Flynn Boyle was recently accused of acting oddly on a British Airways flight from Los Angeles to London. Witnesses have said nudity and extreme lack of inhibition were involved. When Boyle was confronted by reporters with the rumors, she refused to elaborate, noting simply, "My job is to entertain, and not to explain." I hereby declare that to be both your motto and mantra in the coming week, Leo.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

My friend Kathleen traveled to Maui with her nine-year-old daughter Ariel. They checked into an ocean-side condo. At 5 a.m. on their first morning there, Ariel crept over to Kathleen's bed and repeatedly whispered, "Let's go see the sea turtles." Rising out of the depths of sleep, Kathleen was torn. Part of her was peeved at the intrusion because she wanted to luxuriate in bed till late morning. Another part of her longed to glimpse the turtles, which only appeared in the cove once a day at dawn. Kathleen decided to join Ariel, conquering her annoyance and putting aside her desire for comfort. The payoff was worth it. Seeing the turtles while in a dreamy state was an unforgettable joy. I predict you will be faced with a comparable situation in the coming week, Virgo. I suggest you choose as Kathleen did.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

One of my ex-girlfriends had heart surgery when she was an infant. They opened her tiny chest, fixed the problem, and sewed her back up, leaving a two-inch scar on her skin. By the time she became an adult, the scar had grown along with the rest of her, stretching to eight inches. I regard this as a good metaphor for the way our early psychic wounds expand as we mature. Having said that, though, I'm happy to report that you now have an excellent chance to dramatically dissipate the lingering pain of an old trauma, as well as to shrink the scar it made. Please take maximum advantage of the healing energy available.

While mountain biking, I spied a white horse engaged in odd behavior in a meadow. Over and over again, it took two steps forward and two steps back. Was it neurotic or distraught? I decided to sit and watch. Five minutes went by. Ten. Still it continued its routine. Finally I got inspired to pray for it. "Dear Goddess," I said, "please at least let that poor horse go *three* steps forward and two steps back." Moments later, the creature started doing exactly what I'd prayed for. Slowly, it made progress across the field. Now I'm saying a similar prayer for you: "Dear Goddess, please help Scorpios escape their treadmill-like pace, and go at least three steps forward for every two backward."

Actor Vin Diesel was describing the work required of him in the film, *The Pacifier.* "The hardest stunt I ever had to do was allow my ear to be gnawed on by a duck," he said. I fully expect that among the many stunts you will be asked to perform in the coming weeks, Sagittarius, none will be more dangerous or uncomfortable than Diesel's. I won't mind if you bitch about them the whole time, but please bear in mind how innocuous they will all turn out to be.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Drugs don't give Indian holy man Mangal Das a buzz. Maybe he has meditated too much to be affected by mere chemicals. In his quest for experience that takes him outside of his usual awareness, he has also arranged to be bitten by snakes and scorpions. Unfortunately, that doesn't give him a kick, either. He even tried drinking elixirs made from toxic herbs, but there was no bang to be had. Finally he found an intoxicant that worked: touching live wires. Now he enjoys getting an electrical shock every day. I wouldn't be surprised if you soon embarked on a comparable quest to expand your thrills, Capricorn. But please limit your search to things that are really good for you. Avoid the shock and poison options.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

A Bengal tiger at a zoo in Burma killed one of her two-week-old cubs. Zoo officials decided to separate her from her other two cubs. They did so reluctantly because the Bengal tiger is an endangered species and these were the first cubs born in the zoo in 16 years. Putting out a call for a surrogate mother, the officials were relieved when a 40-year-old woman, a mother of three children, pledged to breast-feed the cubs until their teeth grew in. Although your pressing need has arisen from very different factors, Aquarius, you, like the cubs, should be open to receiving nourishment from exotic sources in the coming weeks.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Centuries ago, the sight of a Viking ship on the horizon cast dread into the hearts of villagers who lived on the east coast of what's now Britain. Rightfully so: The Norse raiders were infamous for plundering and killing. Today, though, the Vikings frighten no one. The loss of their status as a symbol of fear is epitomized by the silly replica of a Viking ship that a Dutchman named Robert McDonald is building out of 15 million lollipop sticks. This transformation is a good analogy for the process that should unfold in your life during the coming weeks, Pisces. Something that has always scared you is ready to be reduced to a harmless cartoon.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I think you're ready for your once-a-decade reminder from Anais Nin about the hazards of not growing. I first brought her pithy quote to the attention of the Aries tribe back in 1993. It had a salubrious effect on many of you, dissolving some of your crystallized fears and speeding up your evolution. Let's hope it works the same magic this time: "The day came when the risk it took to remain tight inside the bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom." (P.S. Think back to where you were in 1993. It's time for you to leap to the next level as you resume working on a long-term project you began back then.)

Every year of their adult lives, male Emperor penguins in Antarctica spend 60 consecutive days standing out in the frigid wastes without food as they guard and brood the eggs containing their offspring. Their ordeal reminds me a little of the story of your life lately, Taurus. You've been out in the cold doing your duty for a long time. But I believe you're ready to do something akin to what the male penguins do when the babies finally hatch and the mothers return from their 60-day vacations: feast and rest, rest and feast.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

If you're like most people, you have an ailment you've learned to live with. It's bothersome though not incapacitating. Maybe you've tried various treatments for it, but it never quite goes away, or it recedes for a while and returns in force. That's the bad news. The good news, Gemini, is that you now have extra power to zap that nagging malady. I suggest you start the process by having a dialogue with the affected part of your body. Explain to it why you really want it to heal itself now. Next step: Devote yourself to doing the research and getting the help that brings a total cure.

A reviewer in the San Francisco Chronicle said this about Judy Budnitz's book, Nice Big American Baby: "Reading Budnitz's stories is like experiencing the exhilaration of flight with the queasiness of vertigo. She can take you to new heights, but don't expect a comfortable ride." While this may be a good assessment of the book, it's also an apt description of your immediate future, Cancerian. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you will be veering back and forth between feelings akin to a rapturous flying dream and a dizzying free fall. Don't worry: There'll be a mostly happy ending, even if you feel a bit seasick as you arrive in the winner's circle.

Henry David Thoreau took his relationship with nature as seriously as he did his connections with people. "I frequently tramped eight or ten miles," he said, "to keep an appointment with a beech tree or a yellow birch or an old acquaintance among the pines." This is an attitude I encourage you to emulate in the coming weeks, Leo. Non-human life forms will have a lot to give you. The great outdoors should be a classroom where you seek wisdom that will help you solve your most pressing questions, as well as a temple where you can go to bask in the presence of lively and surprising truths.

Two Indian mountain climbers recently got married in a place that symbolized the fearlessness they want to bring to their alliance. Along with the officiating priest, they hung 2,000 feet in the air, suspended from ropes between two mountains. I suggest you regard them as your metaphorical role models in the coming weeks, Virgo. You'll be getting unprecedented opportunities to enjoy adventures that involve collaboration, blending, and unification. Take imaginative advantage of those opportunities.

You've heard about horse whisperers, people who have a deeply intuitive, almost psychic rapport with horses. You may have also heard about baby whisperers, those who specialize in reading the body language and secret thoughts of infants. Well you, my dear Libra, currently seem to have the skills of a dove whisperer. If you like, you could probably achieve a mind-meld with those birds in the coming weeks. Perhaps more importantly, you will also possess the unusual blend of powers that doves have symbolized throughout history: to bring peace, to cultivate tender intimacy, and to bless lust.

The World Cow Chip Throwing Contest will be held this week in Beaver, Oklahoma. If you've got the time and inclination, I suggest you attend. It would be especially fortuitous if you not only watched the festivities, but also got a chance to compete. One way or another, Scorpio, you're going to have urges to sling dung--either the metaphorical or actual variety--and it would be far better to do it in a setting where such activity is sanctioned. That way, no reputations will be tweaked and no one will get hurt. If you can't make it to Beaver, Oklahoma, you should maybe arrange your own Cow Chip Throwing Contest in the nearest pasture. If you're an urban dweller, it would be worth driving out to the sticks.

"I have never met a person whose greatest need was anything other than real, unconditional love," said Elizabeth Kubler-Ross. While that observation always applies to you, Sagittarius, it's especially true now. More than at any other time in the past 11 months, you require a flood of profuse, no-strings-attached love. I urge you to go out and do whatever's necessary to get it. By the way, you would also derive stupendous benefits from doling out lavish amounts of unconditional love. Your top priority, therefore, should be to both receive and give over-the-top generosity.

The Mohave Indians once had a tradition of "Great Tellings." Members of the tribe would gather together for many hours, sometimes over the course of a few days, to hear storytellers unfold long narratives about their people's history, with great attention paid to major turning points and heroic adventures. I suggest that you arrange some version of a Great Telling for you and yours, Capricorn. You need to remember where you came from. It's a perfect moment to get in touch with your origins and refresh yourself about all the influences that have led you to where you are today.

Speaking on behalf of the cosmic forces, Aquarius, I urge you to unleash a whole hell of a lot of gratitude in the coming week. I'm not talking about mumbling a few shy words of thanks here and there. I mean you should uncork a fireworks display of extravagant appreciation, delivered with boisterous cheer and expansive body language. Express your gratitude as if you were addressing not just the helper standing right in front of you, but every person, animal, spirit, landscape, and plant that has contributed to making your life as good as it is. Proclaim your reverent, praise-filled paeans of thanks as if you were giving the whole universe its proper due for its many blessings.

"What I give form to in daylight is only one percent of what I have seen in darkness," wrote the artist M.C. Escher. Though he wasn't a Pisces, he could have been speaking for you and your tribe when he said that. You are the zodiac's top explorer of the darkness; you're a connoisseur of vivid and exotic mysteries that are often hard to translate into terms other people can understand. And though I know you must sometimes feel sad about how much of your experience is hidden, you should feel proud if you can, like Escher, bring even one percent of it alive in the sunlit realms. Now here's some really good news: In the coming weeks, you could raise that to a whopping 10 percent.

"Some people weave burlap into the fabric of our lives, and some weave gold thread," says Cosmo Doogood in his Urban Almanac. "Both contribute to make the whole picture beautiful and unique." I would add that there are certain people who on some occasions weave burlap into the fabric of our lives, and at other times weave gold thread. You are such a person, Aries. At this particular moment, though, you're in one of your gold-thread phases. Honor your natural tendencies, please. Save your rougher gifts for later so you can concentrate on giving your grace and beauty now.

Green Day recently won a Grammy for best rock album, but their future was in doubt a few years ago. The band's three members weren't getting along, record sales were declining, and they no longer felt aligned with the bratty punk attitude that had originally been the core of their identity. They tried a variety of experiments to shake themselves out of their funk. Their best idea was to rebel against their signature style by recording a bunch of silly songs like polka ditties and dirty Christmas carols. A similar approach would be a good prescription for you right now, Taurus. Whether you're suffering from a mental block or emotional constipation, one possible cure is to play at being what you're not.

"Always and never are two words you should always remember never to use," said semanticist Wendell Johnson. Though I almost always agree with his advice, I have to make an exception for you Geminis this week. This may be one of the most bigger-than-life, no-strings-attached interludes in many moons. Even the ordinary could become epic; the last might become first and vice versa. In the midst of blockbuster special effects and melodramatic plot twists, you might find that invocations of "always" and "never" are downright reasonable.

"I used to have superpowers," the bumper sticker says, "but my therapist took them away." Does that describe you? Have you been overly normalized by the bland conventions of what constitutes psychological health? Has your spunk been sapped by the pressure to behave yourself in a civilized manner? If so, I have two bits of advice. They'll have a sickening effect if you apply them too liberally, but they'll be a wonderful tonic if you use them in small doses. First, here's some medicine from Thoreau: "Do not be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of much life. Aim above morality. Be not simply good; be good for something." Now try this inoculation by Rumi (as translated by Coleman Barks): "Forget safety./ Live where you fear to live./ Destroy your reputation./ Be notorious./ I have tried prudent planning/ long enough./ From now/ on, I'll be mad."

There are a number of organizations whose specialty is dreaming up new holidays. With their inventions added to the old standards, you now have the chance to goof off as you celebrate something or other on every single day of the year. I'll mention a few upcoming festivals that are perfect for you and your astrological needs. First there's No Housework Day on April 7. Avoid all humdrum domestic chores during that 24-hour period, and don't feel a trace of guilt. April 8 brings Take a Wild Guess Day, when you should entertain sudden inspirations and out-of-the-blue hunches. April 9 is Rebel against Your Past Day. Refuse to be controlled by what you used to be. On April 10, observe Fantastic Fantasy Day, a time when you should let your imagination run wild. April 11 is Wear Someone Else's Clothes Day, and April 12 is Be Big and Loud Day.

Though much of Iceland is covered with snow, glaciers, and lava plateaus, the town of Hveragerdi is graced with greenhouses where geothermal energy is harnessed to grow bananas. You remind me of this oasis, Virgo. Though you're surrounded by what might be described as a barren wasteland, you yourself are a warm, nurturing source of fertility. No matter how inhospitable it might get outside of your circle in the next two weeks, you should just keep growing.

When people need a major alibi to get out of work or explain their absence from an event they're expected to attend, one of the most frequently used excuses is "I had to go to my grandmother's funeral." While I'm definitely not predicting your grandmother will die this week, I am prophesying that you'll need an equally plausible reason to skip out on an unexciting task in order to enjoy a very pleasant adventure. A good surprise is coming, Libra, and you should do whatever it takes to make sure that a previously scheduled duty doesn't get in the way.

Inmates at a penitentiary in Washington have created The Convict Cookbook. Normal prison fare gets pretty boring, so they've improvised recipes that can be cooked in a jail cell using radiator pipes instead of a stove and plastic bags in place of bowls. Proceeds from the book's sale go to a children's museum. Judging from your temporary astrological omens, Scorpio, I think The Convict Cookbook could serve as an inspiration. While you're in nowhere near as tight a spot as those criminals, your style has definitely been getting cramped lately. Why not have fun while you're indisposed? Maybe you can even turn a profit and contribute to a good cause as you do.

English poet William Wordsworth said that "Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings." By that definition, Sagittarius, you'll be a fount of poetry this week. For best results, though, don't immediately translate those spontaneous feelings into action. Let them have their way with you for a while before you decide what they all mean. It's one of those frothy, dazzling times when you have no more important task than to honor your emotional riches with your reverent, patient attention.

Mahatma Gandhi said that "Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony." You are maybe as close as you've ever been to achieving that mythical state. I'm tempted to say that there's a cosmic conspiracy working to unify elements of your life that have long been at odds. Fragments are weaving themselves together as if directed by a power that's beyond your conscious awareness. Contradictions that have at times threatened to make you feel like a hypocrite are tantalizingly close to melting away. I urge you to drop everything, Capricorn, so that you may give yourself fully to an intense collaboration with this cosmic conspiracy.

Anne Sullivan (1866-1936) was a miracle worker who taught the deaf, dumb, and blind child, Helen Keller, how to communicate. Through Sullivan's efforts, Keller grew up to become a renowned author and public speaker dedicated to social reform. I believe most of us are visited at least once in our lives by our own version of Anne Sullivan--a teacher who offers us dramatic help in overcoming our limitations. For you, Aquarius, 2005 could bring the arrival of such a person. Will you respond or will you turn away, retreating to your comfortable ignorance? What happens in the coming weeks may be crucial in answering that question.

I came across an interesting meditation in a New Yorker analysis of the film, The Assassination of Richard Nixon. Describing the main character, Sam Byck, played by Sean Penn, the reviewer observed that "Sam wants to be treated as an individual. But, living in a competitive and utilitarian society, he doesn't have sufficient talent to be treated as an individual." Do you agree with this statement, Pisces? Is it your belief that the more talented a person is, the more deserving he or she is of being treated as an individual? Think it through thoroughly. In the coming week, you'll be dealing with variations on this theme, and how you respond could have a big impact on your ability to express your own talents.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Sabotage all attempts at cooperation. Resist acts of unification. No matter what, refuse to forgive anyone. Your role models should be the Israeli rabbis who prayed for the failure of February's peace summit between prime minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian leader Magmud Abbas.  APRIL FOOL! I was just kidding, of course. Don't you dare pray for continued dissonance, even if it seems to serve your short-range interests. It may not be obvious yet, but you're on the cusp of a breakthrough in your ability to blend your energies with others. You shouldn't let anything get in the way.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The mummified middle finger of Galileo's right hand is on display at a museum in Florence, Italy. I propose that you regard it as your sacred power object in the coming week. May it inspire you to flip the bird at everyone who crosses you. APRIL FOOL! While I do think you should derive inspiration from Galileo's middle finger, you should do so only at truly important moments. Not to express road rage, for God's sake; not to express disdain toward loudmouths using cell phones. Please, Taurus, flip a metaphorical bird only to protest the kind of high-level idiocy Galileo had to endure when the Church persecuted him for proving that the Earth revolves around the sun.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

To quote Malcolm X, you've been hoodwinked. You've been had. You've been lead astray. You've been bamboozled. Wake up and smell the deceit before it's too late, Gemini. APRIL FOOL! What I just said is a complete lie. Here's your real horoscope: You're actually very well-armed against illusion and delusion. At no other time in your life have you been less likely to get fooled or ripped off or manipulated. You have a sixth sense that allows you to sniff out hidden agendas that simmer beneath the official stories. This wonderful development is the result of your growing determination to be honest with yourself.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Several New Age futurists have predicted that the U.S. will someday have a Secretary of Prophecy, a cabinet-level official who uses shamanic insight to counsel the President on the health of the nation's soul. Personally, though, I can't imagine it will happen any time soon. And that's too bad, because I'm perfect for the job. My psychic powers are growing, as are my political skills, my practical compassion, and my vision of how to do what's best for the most people. APRIL FOOL! Everything I just bragged about is as much true about you as it is about me. We Crabs are in an astrological phase when many of us are becoming better equipped to serve as intuitive advisers to the powers-that-be. In fact, I suggest you start pushing for more responsibility and clout.



Life will be a gorgeous mystery in the coming week. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

It would be a good week for you to obtain a burglar alarm, self-defense pepper spray, and a psychic protection amulet advertised in the back of a tabloid. You should obsess on making yourself ultra-secure and absolutely safe. APRIL FOOL! I was just testing to see how gullible you are to the media's compulsive fear-mongering. The truth is, Leo, you're in a phase when you should expand your sense of adventure and increase your willingness to take smart risks. Instead of the burglar alarm, pepper spray, and amulet, why don't you get yourself something like a rope ladder, crocodile spear, and camel saddle?

Renowned psychic Victoria Bullis is working on a cookbook filled with recipes she's channeling from dead celebrities, including Chris Farley, Princess Diana, and John F. Kennedy. Since you also have a talent for this kind of work right now, you might want to contact her and communicate your research. She's at www.victoriabullis.com. APRIL FOOL! While it's true that you have more access than usual to departed spirits, I suggest you use this privilege wisely--certainly not by seeking recipes from formerly famous people you never knew. Instead, seek help and insight from loved ones and friends you trusted while they were alive.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Remember that moment some time back when you buried your tear-stained face in your pillow and begged God to please send you your soul mate? I hate to say it, Libra, but I believe it's possible that God may have heard you incorrectly, thinking you said "cell mate" instead of "soul mate." That's the bad news. The good news is that it's an ideal time to fix that misunderstanding. I suggest you summon the same desperate longing that launched your prayer way back when, only this time clearly enunciate the words "soul mate." APRIL FOOL! God can read your mind, and always knows what you mean--if, that is, you know what you mean. Do you? This is a perfect time to figure out exactly what it is you really want in an intimate relationship.

It's illegal to hunt whales in landlocked Utah, ride a bike in a swimming pool in California, and walk on your hands while crossing a street in Hartford, Connecticut. You risk arrest in Nova Scotia if you water a lawn while it's raining, and could be thrown in jail for eating ice cream on Sunday while on Ottawa's Bank Street. I recommend that you research all the similarly dumb laws that are on the books in your part of the world, and systematically break them. APRIL FOOL! You've got better revolts to attend to than that, Scorpio. Don't waste your time rebelling against irrelevant laws that few people know about. Direct your dissent at dumb rules that are truly hurtful.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

More than half of the people polled say they would keep their jobs if they won the lottery. You yourself may have to make that decision soon, Sagittarius. Will being a millionaire cause you to completely renounce your current way of life? I hope not. APRIL FOOL! I am NOT, in fact, predicting you will win the lottery. However, it's quite possible that you'll be blessed with some other stroke of luck that will tempt you to leave behind familiar things that helped put you where you are today. Be thoughtful about how you navigate your way through the changes caused by your good fortune.



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The information produced in the world every year would fill 37,000 Library of Congresses. Unfortunately, you haven't been keeping up very well. If you know what's good for you, you'll dramatically increase your uptake of raw data. Read more newspapers and magazines, please. Spend more time surfing the Web. Watch more TV. APRIL FOOL! Ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent of all that raw data is useless, meaningless, and corrupted with half-truth. In fact, to best serve your mental health you should get a high-quality Bullshit Detector. Either that, or invite more silence into your life.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

You seriously need to subscribe to Lucky magazine or the Robb Report or some other glossy rag about shopping. Your consumer skills have deteriorated. You're becoming hopelessly inept at finding luxury items at bargain prices. Shape up, Aquarius. APRIL FOOL! The truth is that it's an excellent time for you to take a sabbatical from consumerism. See if you can go entire days without spending any money at all. Build psychic barriers in your imagination that will make you immune to seductive commercials. Read Adbusters magazine.



Got enough clues to chew on for a while? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You're about to enter a phase that will resemble Bizarro World, the fictional realm in Superman comics. It's a cube-shaped planet where everything is the opposite of life on Earth: Stupidity is revered, hypocrisy is routine, and nothing's regarded as true unless it's ugly. APRIL FOOL! The conditions I just described as characteristic of Bizarro World are actually pretty close to the values that prevail here on our planet. So while it's true that you'll be in a phase when everything's the reverse of normal life, that will be a very good thing. Compassionate intelligence will be revered. Many people will be painstakingly consistent in serving their high principles. Truth and beauty will often be found in the same place. Have fun!

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Niccolo Paganini (1782-1840) was a virtuoso violinist as well as a master showman. Not content to dazzle audiences with his technical wizardry, he sometimes resorted to tricks to evoke even greater levels of astonished appreciation. Before one concert, he partially sawed through three of his violin's strings. When they broke in the midst of his first piece, he finished using just the remaining string. I'm telling you this story, Aries, because you may soon enter a Paganini-like state. You'll be at the top of your game, yet also tempted to add extra glitz to your shtick. It's not really necessary; your work will speak just fine for itself. But if you can't restrain yourself from going over the top, make sure you don't sacrifice any of your substance as you pump up your style.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

From an astrological perspective, it won't be a good week to make big decisions based on what you read in newspaper horoscope columns. Similarly, the cosmic rhythms won't be aligned in your favor if you sit down in the middle of an intersection and beg an angel for a sign about which way you should go. On the other hand, you shouldn't rely on the advice of practical experts or logical analysts to direct you, either. Their influence would be equally wrong. In my opinion, there's only one thing you can trust right now: your body. You should formulate specific questions and invite your body to reveal the answers through its feelings and sensations.

My Gemini friend Thomas will be throwing a big party for himself soon. He'll be celebrating his graduation from a local college where he has been taking classes since 1993. His many years of matriculation can be explained in part by the sheer enjoyment he gets from being a student. The other reason for the delay is that he has had trouble passing a certain course that's necessary for his degree. But he's doing well in the course this time around; his teacher has told him he'll probably pass. I believe his imminent completion is something like what's unfolding in your life. Whether or not you're formally enrolled in school, you're about to complete lessons you've studied for a long time.

The government of Uzbekistan has jailed over 6,000 people for their political or religious beliefs. With the help of a large secret police force, its dictatorial ruler ruthlessly suppresses all opposition movements and independent media. Meanwhile, the United States has steadily expanded its military assistance to the Central Asian nation, increasing its contributions 1,800 percent since 2001. According to my reading of the astrological omens, this is a perfect example of behavior you should avoid in the coming weeks. Do not, under any circumstances, support anyone or anything that squelches freedom or inhibits vitality, even if they purport to be doing it in a good cause. Give yourself generously, on the other hand, to influences that help people thrive in all their fertile diversity.

Isaac Asimov once said something that should be especially meaningful for you: "The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka! I have found it!' but rather 'That's funny . . .'" According to my analysis of the astrological omens, your imminent destiny should lead you to some fascinating adventures that begin with "That's funny." Be hungry for what piques your imagination and tickles your love of mystery. Attune yourself to anything that seems out-of-place or oddly juxtaposed.

When's the last time you really gave yourself permission to watch a sunrise or sunset for more than a few seconds? I bet this activity has fallen so far off your list of things to do that if left to your own devices you may not treat yourself to it for months. That's just one reason I feel called to do an intervention. The other reason has to do with your current astrological omens. They say that you desperately need to be lifted up out of the everyday trance and exposed to sublime beauty; that you need to commune with our home star, the source of all the energy that fuels your life.

"If there's a book you really want to read but it hasn't been written yet," said author Toni Morrison, "then you must write it." In the event that you're a writer, Libra, I direct her counsel to you. It's timely advice. But if you're not a writer, take heed instead of the following: If there's a world you want to live in or a gift you want to receive or a deed you want to benefit from or an adventure you want thrust upon you, make it yourself.

"The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do," said English journalist Walter Bagehot. I don't agree with that in general, but it could temporarily be true for you, Scorpio. There may be no other activity that will generate as much satisfaction as refuting the low expectations others have had of you. Even classic thrills like sex, drugs, and rock and roll may not generate feelings equal to the bliss you'll enjoy when you accomplish what some supposedly knowledgeable person said was impossible.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Some readers complain when I draw inspiration from a public figure they consider a bad person. Once I cited philosopher Bertrand Russell, and Patti G. went ballistic: "Russell was a terrible father! How dare you give him any credence?" Another time I invoked a bit of wisdom from ex-U.S. president Teddy Roosevelt. "Why would you give that militaristic bully any space in your column?" wrote Arthur H. Here's how I usually respond to these grumbles: If I refused to learn from people unless I agreed with everything they had ever said and done, I would never learn from anyone. What about you, Sagittarius? Have you set up your life so that everyone is either on or off your good list? The astrological omens suggest it's an excellent time to dole out more slack, and to cultivate a capacity to derive help and insight from people who aren't perfect. 



No one knows you better than you do. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In all of North America, from Oaxaca, Mexico to Canada's Prince Edward island, there is only one state, province, or territory that does not yet have a McDonald's fast-food restaurant. It is Nunavut, in northern Canada, which the Inuit people inhabit at a density of about one person per 3,300 square miles. You should be like Nunavut in the coming week, Capricorn: unspoiled by mediocre food, vulgar entertainment, crass commercialism, and cheap plastic anything. Be like a vast, pristine empire that's immune to soul-deadening crap.

As a performer in Canada's Daredevil Opera Company, Tom Comet set a world record for juggling chainsaws. He threw and caught three of them 44 times while they were turned on and full of gasoline. Though there's no need for you to take that big a risk, Aquarius, you're likely to have a similar ability in your own chosen field. Whether you're managing to be all things to all people or trying to be in several places at once, I bet you'll demonstrate an extraordinary skill at juggling.

A group of 12 workers in Derby, England bought a lottery ticket last December. They stuffed it in a plastic beaker at their workshop and forgot about it. Two months later, one of them read in the newspaper that the jackpot prize was still unclaimed. He tracked down the old ticket they'd bought and realized it had the winning numbers. Soon he and his cohorts were collecting the British equivalent of $9.6 million. I regard this as a metaphor for a situation in your life, Pisces. You have not yet claimed a goodie that has been available to you for some time. Remedy that oversight, please.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Many supposedly scientific debunkers deride astrology but have done almost no research on the subject. That's one reason why these ill-informed "skeptics" spread so many ignorant lies. For instance, they say that astrologers think the stars and planets emit invisible beams that affect people's lives. The truth is, most astrologers don't believe any such thing. Is there any way in which you engage in behavior similar to the lazy debunkers, Aries? What subjects do you speak about with authority even though you really don't know much about them? Do you ever spout opinions about situations you've never experienced first-hand? Do you pass judgment on ideas you've never studied and people you've never spent time with? We all do these things--I confess to being guilty of it myself--but this is your special time to make amends.

So begins the Potent Dreaming phase of the year for you, Taurus. In the coming weeks, the adventures you have while you sleep will be far more interesting than any movie you could see in a theater. Some of your dreams may be the nighttime equivalent of wild goose chases and shaggy dog stories, with no discernible plots or meaning. But the revelations you receive in others could change your life forever with useful lessons and brilliant insights.

You can, of course, choose to ignore the invitations that life will offer you in the coming weeks. Having free will means you can always refuse to go with the cosmic flow. But if you would like to weave the threads of a higher destiny into the fabric of your humdrum routine, you should meditate on how you can be more of a leader. Are there ways you could energize a group or organization you're part of? Are you ready to seize the initiative in one of your close relationships, shepherding it into a new era? Are you willing to summon the courage to rise above the hypnotic numbness of the daily grind, stretching your imagination to see the big picture?

"All human beings should try to learn what they are running from, and to, and why," said James Thurber. Judging from the astrological omens, Cancerian, I think this is the perfect time for you to take his advice very seriously. You're in position to see things that are normally invisible to you, including secrets you hide from yourself and truths you have studiously avoided knowing. Maybe you don't think you're telepathic, but I assure you that right now you at least have the power to read your own deep and mysterious mind.

In her memoir, Lipstick Jihad, Azadeh Moaveni describes life in Iran under the crushing oppression of its fundamentalist rulers. She says young people pursue an "'as if' lifestyle," pretending it's permitted "to hold hands on the street, blast music at parties, speak your mind, challenge authority, take your drug of choice, wear too much lipstick." It's a strenuous game, requiring intricate strategies to circumvent the many prohibitions enforced by the morality police. I suggest that you take your cue from these covert freedom fighters, Leo. Start by identifying the big NO that constantly casts a shadow over your life. Does it come from voices inside your head or from external authorities?  Live as if you were free to be yourself completely, without having to answer to your personal version of Iran's dour mullahs.

"You can't depend on your judgment," said Mark Twain, "when your imagination is out of focus." And since your imagination is more than a little fuzzy and aimless right now, Virgo, I recommend that you postpone decisions that would require you to have acute judgment. On the other hand, don't get twisted out of shape about it. It's not a big problem. All you have to do to sharpen up your imagination is expose it in a concentrated way to some great works of art or music or literature.

Some journalists have been expressing pious outrage about baseball players who may have enhanced their physical abilities with steroids. Next maybe they will turn their attention to computer pioneers whose revolutionary innovations in the '70s and '80s were spurred by their ingestion of psychedelic drugs; and musicians, writers, filmmakers, and actors whose creativity is primed by dope and booze; and politicians like the first President George Bush, who regularly took Halcion, a sleeping pill with side effects like amnesia, anxiety attacks, and paranoia; and the millions of average people who make life-changing decisions while in the grip of psychotropics like Prozac or that powerful drug, caffeine. What's your performance-enhancing, mind-altering substance of choice, Libra? Whatever it is, this is the week you should fully acknowledge its impact on your destiny. Celebrate its gifts and analyze its downsides.

It's a good time for you to think about your relationship to human beings who haven't been born yet. Is there anything you can do to be more conscious about making your life a gift to the future? What might you create that would enhance the destinies of our descendants? How can you conduct yourself so that you will not only help preserve the wonders we live amidst, but actually enhance them? As you ponder your possible contributions--and maybe also take practical action to deepen your commitment to them--keep in mind this thought from Lewis Carroll: "It's a poor sort of memory that only works backward."

They tout the value of harnessing opportunities that open up when you or someone else does something embarrassing, clumsy, or clueless. I suggest you try exactly what they recommend, Capricorn. More than any other sign of the zodiac, you now have the potential to take maximum advantage of everything that's dicey, thorny, and ticklish.

For members of the Aquarian tribe, that figure is likely to zoom precipitously upward in the coming weeks, as will the sheer number of erotic encounters involving the lips and tongue. In fact, all activities involving pleasure with the mouth are likely to lead to success and happiness, including (but not limited to) gourmet eating, loud singing, and wild talking. For extra credit, try combining two activities: gourmet eating and wild talking, for instance, or singing and oral sex.

In a sense, I've collaborated with Thurber. I've blended my mind with his, and together we have come up with counsel that includes both of our thoughts but offers wisdom that's more than the sum of its parts. I suggest that you use this strategy in the coming week, Pisces. Choose people whose lives or work you admire, and work together to create synergies that draw on both their genius and yours.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Some freaks of nature, like four-leaf clovers, are considered good luck. Others, like six-legged frogs, are omens that something is amiss. Then there are the prodigies that are a little scary because they're so bizarrely extraordinary, even if they're also signs of hope. A few years back, for example, some Native Americans believed the birth of a white buffalo in Wisconsin heralded the healing of Grandmother Earth and the unification of the races. It's quite possible, Aries, that you will soon have brushes with all three types of mutants. To increase the likelihood that you'll escape an encounter with the six-legged frog variety, all you have to do is avoid indulging in negative thoughts about people.

The all-embracing spirit of this event is what I urge you to cultivate in the coming days, Taurus. It's time to erase boundaries and bulldoze pigeonholes; to expand your imagination as you welcome in the widest variety of influences you can summon. You're ready to get so far out of the box that you can't even see the box anymore.

Let's add a new word to your vocabulary: veraison. It's used by grape growers to define the explosive ripening their crop undergoes about a month before the harvest. Up to this point, the grapes are small and hard and pale. Then, within a few days, they get softer and sweeter as they darken in color and grow dramatically bigger. Even experienced viticulturalists don't know when exactly veraison will occur. It happens fast and without warning. But I can pretty confidently predict that you're about to enjoy the human version of veraison, Gemini. Happy ripening season!

An intractable dispute between players and owners has caused the National Hockey League to cancel its entire season. Many long-time fans are rethinking their devotion to the sport. "The distressing thing is, my heroes are morons," Vaughn Derderian told the Detroit Free Press. "And that's a reflection on me." I bring this to your attention, Cancerian, in the hope it will prod you into taking inventory of your own heroes, teachers, and role models. Are they truly serving you? Is it possible they served you at one time but have become nostalgic artifacts of an earlier phase of your development? Could you make them work better for you if you were more analytical about their impact on you? Meditate on questions like these as you consider the possibility that you're ready to go hunting for a fresh batch of inspiring influences.

Now he's retired from that gig and owns a restaurant in Kabul. He has few regrets, but one came after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. While exploring the organization's deserted safe houses, he happened upon a place where Osama bin Laden and his wife had lived. Among the items the couple left behind was one of her bras. In retrospect Jouvenal realized he should have pocketed the exotic piece of lingerie; a tabloid newspaper would have paid him a fortune for it. But because he had spent his entire career dealing with more respectable news media, the idea didn't even occur to him at the time. Remember this tale, Leo. Don't overlook things that could prove valuable even though you wouldn't normally think they were.

Shortly after the year 1000, Icelandic Vikings made two sojourns in the land that's now called North America. During the second expedition, one of the brave explorers, Gudrid Thorbjarnardottir, gave birth to a son. Snorri Thorfinnsson became the first European born in the New World. I hereby appoint Snorri to be your patron saint in the coming weeks, Virgo. May he inspire you to beget a brainchild as you acclimate yourself to living in a frontier.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says global warming might be a boon for his country because people "would spend less money on fur coats and other warm things." Similarly, my meteorologist friend Kurt notes that as air pollution has grown worse, sunsets have become more spectacularly beautiful. I like to think that you will find comparable redemption from your recent crises, Libra. In fact, I will make this prediction: The metaphorical version of a toxic spill will somehow lead you to a magical elixir.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"Many of us don't change until we're in crisis mode," notes psychologist Robert Maurer, "until our mate leaves us or we lose our job. Once that moment comes we look for a big leap to get out of pain." Unfortunately, big leaps under pressure usually don't work. If you really want to change, you have to accomplish it little by little, and it's best to begin long before you're feeling miserable, scared, or backed into a corner. I mention this, Scorpio, because it's a perfect time to launch a step-by-step course correction that will ensure you won't get pinched by a predicament in April. Start modifying your behavior and adjusting your attitude while you're at the top of your game.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Your metaphor for the week is a spork, the dining implement that combines the features of a spoon and a fork. It has a rounded basin to hold liquids as well as a few tines on the end to stab solid food. Like the spork, you should be versatile as you gather nourishment for body and soul. On the one hand, you should be willing to make yourself a receptive vessel that can draw sustenance from ephemeral or mercurial stimuli; on the other hand you should be poised to aggressively snag more substantial fare.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Michael Weliky, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences, decided to test the accuracy of the old saw that we only use ten percent of our brains. He dreamed up a brilliant experiment that involved 12 ferrets watching the movie, The Matrix. His research was so convincing that the prestigious journal Nature published it. He concluded that we actually use 80 percent of our available brainpower, though much of the activity takes place unconsciously. I predict your own efficiency will be even higher in the coming weeks, Capricorn, perhaps zooming above the 90-percent level. It might be time for you to try solving some of your most enduring mysteries. You'll no doubt be able to come up with approaches as innovative as having ferrets watch The Matrix.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Be very discriminating about how you give and receive gifts, Aquarius. Unless everyone's motives are clear and impeccable, seeming acts of generosity could get distorted by hidden agendas. Please know that I am by no means making a prediction that there will be trouble. It's just that you must exercise even more than the usual amount of care to ensure that the bestowing of blessings doesn't lead to unintended consequences. Did you hear about the two teenage girls in Colorado who got sued by a neighbor after they brought her a late-night surprise gift of freshly baked cookies?

The hero of Haruki Murakami's surrealistic novel, Kafka on the Shore, can cause schools of fish to fall like rain from the sky. I suspect that you might be able to do that yourself, Pisces. At least temporarily, you have uncanny abilities; I'm tempted to say that you actually possess magical powers. Be careful how you use your wizardry, please. Use it exclusively to perform good works. There's no need to turn your adversaries into jack-in-the-boxes if you can simply make them less adversarial. You shouldn't waste your talent on materializing $20 bills on the sidewalk when you can just as easily manifest an improvement in your working conditions.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central's "The Daily Show," is a big star now. But on his way to the top, he has sometimes had a laidback attitude towards ambition. "As long as I can remember," he has said, "I wanted to sleep late, stay up late, and do nothing in between." Believe it or not, Aries, I suggest you adopt an equally leisurely approach in the coming week. The best thing you can do to serve your burning desires in the long run is to explore the healing mysteries of being a lazy bum right now.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Harvest time in March? That's what the astrological omens say for you Bulls. During the next few weeks you'll be reaping the fruits of all the seeds you've sown since your last birthday. One of the pesky weeds you didn't uproot will also be reaching full bloom, but the tiny bit of blight it engenders will be vastly overshadowed by the richness of your rewards. I suggest you throw a party or two to celebrate your bounty, express gratitude to your helpers, and offer forgiveness to your doubters.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Events in the coming week may be difficult for some of you to deal with. They will include intense encounters with peace, love, joy, and understanding, as well as possible brushes with extravagant beauty, lyrical delight, and inspiring discoveries. There will be a dearth of storylines that feature betrayal, abuse, pettiness, greed, extortion, disease, and explosions. Therefore, Gemini, you should proceed with extreme caution if you're a jaded hipster who's suspicious of feeling really good. Ask yourself: "Am I ready to stop equating cynicism with insight? Do I dare take the risk that exposing myself to uplifting encounters might dull my intelligence?" If you doubt your ability to handle all the relaxing breakthroughs, you'd better take strong measures to evade them.

"The average river requires a million years to move a grain of sand one hundred miles," says science writer James Trefil. The work you've been doing on yourself these past two years, Cancerian, must sometimes have seemed as maddeningly gradual. The good news is that you are now in the last few months of this slow-motion, long-term project. If you can sustain your focus, you'll finish up around your birthday, having created such a strong inner sense of sanctuary that you will forever after be able to feel at home in the world no matter where you are.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I have a tricky assignment for you this week, Leo. It will require you to display an open-hearted curiosity as you live on the edge of your understanding. It will ask you to be cheerful and optimistic as you question as many of your certainties as you can. Your challenge is to embody the attitude suggested by Caroline Myss in this passage from her CD, Spiritual Madness: The Necessity of Meeting God in Darkness: "The moment you come to trust chaos, you see God clearly. Chaos is divine order, versus human order. Change is divine order, versus human order. When the chaos becomes safety to you, then you know you're seeing God clearly."

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In the coming week, people may have a lot to tell you about what you shouldn't think, how you shouldn't act, and whom you shouldn't hang out with. Their counsel will be useful mostly in its revelations about them. If I were you, I wouldn't actually heed much of what they say. What you should trust, though, is your calm, lucid inner voice, especially when it gives you intuitions about what you shouldn't think, how you shouldn't act, and whom you shouldn't hang out with. This is an ideal time to get clearer about the life you don't want to live.

Spankings can raise your intelligence, reports The Weekly World News. Experiments by the Lucerne Institute of Psychological Research showed that college students did better on their exams after having their buns whacked. Increased adrenalin flow may have contributed to this surprising phenomenon, the psychologists speculated. "The adrenalin combined with the endorphins generated to minimize the pain, and together they opened up previously underutilized neural pathways--turning them into IQ hyperlinks," said one researcher. I bring this up, Libra, because you've got a big life test coming up. If I were you, I'd be willing to try innovative measures to make sure you ace it, including maybe even having a ping-pong paddle administered to your backside. The preparations that helped you through rites of passage in the past may not work this time.

In the coming days, Scorpio, you will almost certainly become pregnant--if not by literally conceiving a fetus, then by germinating the metaphorical equivalent. Do you have any idea about what's getting ready to sprout within you? I hope so, because if you do, it means you're attuned to the secrets that have been ripening in the fertile depths. But if you don't know anything about the new life that's stirring, drop everything and find out. You need to be a fully conscious participant in the gestation.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"Americans live inside their own private echo chambers," says syndicated writer Matt Zoller Seitz, "endlessly revisiting things they already know they like and avoiding exposure to anything new and different." Your assignment this week, Sagittarius, is to ask yourself if you fit Seitz's description, and then--if you do--to escape your private echo chamber. So for instance, if you're a tattooed pagan performance artist, attend a rodeo or NASCAR race; if you're a Christian Girl Scout leader, listen to Ani DiFranco or Radiohead, or read Noam Chomsky's radical critiques of American foreign policy. If you're an atheistic intellectual, take a workshop in ecstatic Sufi dancing or a class in Buddhist meditation. I think you catch my drift.

I'd love to see you reach out to the people who you think should have reached out to you by now. I'd love to see you heal rifts with former allies and rebuild bridges you burned down. Even if it feels like a slightly awkward compromise, I'd love to see you offer your services to X-factors and wild cards and loose cannons that aren't exactly making the best use of their powers. How about it, Capricorn? Are you willing to bend a little to gain a lot? Can you imagine giving more slack to flawed possibilities, hoping that your largesse will help them fix their flaws?

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

The astrological omens are unambiguous: In the coming weeks, the entire universe will be conspiring to help you add to your assets, increase your value, and acquire more resources. Does that mean you'll get a raise or inherit your great uncle's ostrich farm? Does it mean you'll enroll in a training program to upgrade your skills and expand your know-how? Or does it mean you'll cultivate a previously underdeveloped part of your personality that will then become more attractive and desirable? I can't say for sure, Aquarius. How it all unfolds will depend on your priorities--and on how aggressively you cooperate with the universal conspiracy.

In her book, For the Time Being, Annie Dillard says that throughout history many people have thought civilization was on the verge of collapse. Around 300 B.C., Hindus believed they were living in a "degenerate and unfortunate time" known as the Kali Yuga--the lowest point in the great cosmic cycle. In 426 A.D., the Christian writer Augustine mourned that the world was in its last days. In the 1800s, renowned Hasidic Rabbi Nachman grieved for the world's "widespread atheism and immorality." Dillard offers more examples, concluding, "There never was a more holy age than ours, and never a less . . . There is no whit less enlightenment under the tree by your street than there was under the Buddha's bo tree." Go sit under that tree, Pisces. The time for your awakening is now at hand.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

During a morning hike in the hills, I scavenged for omens to use in your horoscope. Nothing pertinent appeared until I was headed home. While rambling down a trail from the top of the ridge, I spied the back of a man moving towards me. It took me a while to realize he was walking up the hill backwards. As he passed me, I heard him giving himself a pep talk. Later I told my 13-year-old daughter Zoe about this scene, seeking her insight about what motivated him to engage in such an odd mode of travel. To my surprise, Zoe said she'd done it herself. It's a psychological trick that helps make a steep ascent easier: You stay focused on how much you've already accomplished rather than being overwhelmed by the heights that are ahead of you. I recommend that you try this yourself, Aries.

How long do you want to live? Before you answer, remember that thousands of scientists are engaged in research to crack the code of the aging process. They will ultimately make breakthroughs that could allow you to be healthy and vigorous for many more decades. In the meantime, the astrological omens suggest this is a perfect moment to meditate on what you can personally do to promote your own longevity. What habits of mind and body can you cultivate that will keep you forever fresh? And now I drink a toast to your coffin, Taurus. May it be fashioned of lumber obtained from a hundred-year-old cypress tree whose seed will be planted this week.

"If there is anything I'm trying to incorporate into my strategy of governing, it's a willingness to make mistakes, a willingness to try new things," San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom told AP writer Lisa Leff. "I'm probably as proud of my failures as I am of what someone deems successes." I suggest you emulate Newsom's approach in the coming weeks, Gemini. Don't bother with timid experiments that you feel tempted to apologize for; don't mess around with half-assed tinkering. Rather, be candid and humble as you try daring changes that may or may not work.

"Religion is like a knife," Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu told Msnbc.com. "When you use a knife for cutting up bread to prepare sandwiches, a knife is good. If you use the same knife to stick into somebody's guts, a knife is bad." Let's use his idea as a seed for your horoscope, Cancerian. Are there any aspects of your spirituality that are rooted in anger, hatred, or intolerance? Are there other aspects that move you to see the best in everyone and do what you can to promote their welfare? From an astrological perspective, it's a perfect moment to be totally honest with yourself as you take an inventory of the nature and effects of your religious inclinations.

After having a potent dream that's too complicated to go into here, I rethought the meaning of the astrological omens and altered your oracle to read as follows: "You may find yourself wandering through a fun-house situation, complete with stairways that lead you to invigorating mysteries, labyrinths lined with mirrors that help you take yourself less seriously, and protective gargoyles that will scare away menacing demons."

To be in maximum alignment with the cosmic trends, go to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and commune with the painting "Peach Tree in Blossom" while sipping peach blossom wine and thinking deep thoughts about the parts of you that are like peach blossoms. Here's another possibility: Travel to a place where actual peach blossoms are blooming and meditate on why the Chinese consider this flower the most auspicious of plants. If you can't manage either of those actions, Virgo, please at least find images of peach blossoms on the Internet and gaze at them as you muse fondly of the delicate young aspects of your life that most need your love and care.

Fairy tales are full of characters who suffer loss and hardship for trying to be something they're not. If they ever change their ways and accept the truth about themselves, their luck improves dramatically. It's interesting, then, to contemplate the fact that our culture adores film and TV actors, who specialize in pretending to be someone other than who they really are. Do you buy into our collective obsession, Libra? If so, I urge you to cut way back in the coming weeks. You need to be careful about exposing yourself to influences that might encourage you to be something you're not.

Burning Man, the annual festival in the Nevada desert, is experiencing a crisis. Some long-term supporters are unhappy about the direction it has taken in recent years. Chicken John Rinaldi told the San Francisco Chronicle that it used to be a joyfully chaotic jubilee of surprising art,  but lately has turned into a mindless party and "giant group hug--a petting zoo for overweight people in their mid-40s." At the next Burning Man in August, Rinaldi hopes to restore what he sees as its radical mission. Is there a comparable development happening in your life, Scorpio? Has an institution or ideal you've held dear begun to decline or lose its way? I bet there is. So what are you waiting for? Go out and fix it; redeem it; revive its glory.

Pulitzer Prize winner Annie Dillard counsels aspiring authors to hone their chops by immersing themselves in scenes that aren't right in front of them. "Write about winter in the summer," she says. "Describe Dublin as James Joyce did, from a desk in Paris. Willa Cather wrote her prairie novels in New York City; Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn in Hartford." Even if you're not a writer, Sagittarius, I suggest you do something similar. Identify a time in your past that has always mystified you or rendered you dumb. Dive into those memories with the intention of making them sing for you; rethink all the perplexing moments until you transform them into a beacon.

He formulated much of "The 95 Theses," the tract that launched the Protestant Reformation, while sitting on a stone commode in his home. Be inspired by Luther, Capricorn: Turn a place where you feel limited into a power spot.

Austrian Prince Pal Antal Esterhazy (1786-1866) was renowned for his extravagance. Roaming across Europe for decades in a constant state of vacation, he squandered his stupendous fortune. In one infamous stunt, he removed a priceless Titian painting from its frame and had it made into the lining for his coat. In bringing this to your attention, Aquarius, I don't mean to imply that you're as profligate as Esterhazy. But there is a way in which you're being as wasteful with one of your valuable assets as he was with his Titian. Fix this glitch, please.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai wants to wipe out his country's opium fields. To do so would destroy the lucrative heroin trade, and local warlords couldn't use their ill-gained profits to influence the parliamentary elections coming up in April. But American military leaders don't want to burn all the poppies. They fear that might destroy Afghanistan's economy and make elections impossible. Heroin is a major export and source of revenue, after all. I predict that you'll soon be facing a personal quandary with resemblances to this one, Aries. What should you do? I suggest you avoid abstract speculations about morality, and instead simply do what's most likely to build up the moral courage of everyone involved.

You're being called on to meet a higher standard. You're being asked to boost your output or take on more responsibility or show you can handle greater expectations. While it's understandable if that's unnerving, I urge you to keep it all in perspective. Remember what journeyman basketball player Jon Koncak said when assigned the task of replacing his team's departed all-star, Shaquille O'Neal. Reporters asked him if he felt a lot of pressure. "Not at all," he replied. "Pressure to me is being in an airplane and the pilot dies and they ask me to fly the plane." The challenge you face may be daunting, Taurus, but it's nothing like that.

I was meditating on your horoscope as I rode my bike up the hill in a misty rain. "Give me a sign," I prayed to the grey-yellow sky. "What do Cancerians need to know?" As I pedaled over the last hump and reached the top, a spectacular response materialized--a five-alarm fire of a rainbow. To my further amazement, I saw where one end of it landed: on the rusty metal roof of a shack in a horse pasture not too far away. I threw down my bike and dashed to it. There were slats missing in the shack's walls, so I could peer inside. I saw a black metal safe in the middle of the room, surrounded by wisps of straw and chained to a u-shaped pipe that disappeared into the floor. I knew I had obtained the oracle you needed--a rough metaphor for the uncanny fate awaiting you. My intuition told me there'll be one difference between my experience and yours: Whereas I had no legal right to whatever was in the safe, you can and should gain access to the storehouse you find.

In 1972, Leo singer Mick Jagger said, "When I'm 33, I'll quit rock and roll. That's a time when a man has to do something else. I don't want to be a rock star all my life." At age 61, Jagger has now been reneging on that promise for almost three decades. It's probably for the best. A person with an ego as monumental as his would likely have been unhappy as, say, a kindergarten teacher or economist. I bring this up, Leo, because it is Renege on Your Unwise, Unwarranted, Unworkable Promises Week. Let Jagger be your inspiration as you weasel out of or bravely renounce an old vow.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"People change and forget to tell each other," mourned playwright Lillian Hellman. I bring this thought to your attention, Virgo, because at least one of your relationships now fits this description. It's at a pivotal point when the accumulated changes you have both undergone can no longer remain unspoken. To avoid becoming irrelevant to each other, you must communicate the backlog of truth now. (P.S. I suspect there are actually two relationships like this.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Charles Darwin spoke of the "survival of the fittest" as being a central factor in the process of evolution. What exactly did he mean by that phrase? The following quote from his seminal book, The Origin of Species, makes it clear: "It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the ones most responsive to change." I suggest you make that thought the seed of your meditations in the coming weeks, Libra. Your literal survival won't be at stake, but the survival of some of your fond dreams might be in question. The only way to guarantee that they thrive is to keep transforming yourself.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The python is your power animal right now, Scorpio. It's renowned for eating large meals. By stretching its jaws, it can devour an entire deer or crocodile in one sitting, providing enough nutrition for as long as a year. Somewhat like the python, you're now in position to ingest a huge amount of food for thought--a banquet of rich and tasty revelations. The feast will take months to digest, and will be a continual source of nourishment the entire time.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

I've decided to install Britney Spears as the Sagittarius of the Week. Not because of her singing or dancing, nor her eccentric relationship with the institution of marriage. Rather, I'm giving her temporary status as your role model because of her disdain for what anyone thinks of her. In recent weeks she has been photographed wandering down the sidewalk with white pimple cream liberally spread on her face. Other photos have revealed her picking her nose, wearing a white t-shirt stained brown from an apparent soft drink spill, and sporting a baseball hat bearing the slogan "Carp√© Ass√ºm: Seize the Ass." Be like her in your own sphere, Sagittarius: cheerfully immune to the oppression of public opinion, peer pressure, conventional wisdom, and the law of the pack.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

If you try to operate a chainsaw or backhoe before you've been trained in its use, you might hurt yourself or others. That doesn't mean the chainsaw and backhoe are evil. Now let's apply this idea as a metaphor for a situation you face right now. I believe you are at the earliest stages of your relationship with a freshly discovered potential. You've realized the benefits that it can ultimately offer you, but you're nowhere near being able to wield it safely and effectively. Having sounded this warning, however, I want to encourage you to begin learning how to use it immediately.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"It's not that I'm so smart," said Albert Einstein, "it's just that I stay with problems longer." This thought should be your foundation in the coming week, Aquarius. As innovative as you can be in dreaming up solutions to knotty dilemmas, you are sometimes insufficiently devoted to the drudgery of executing all the details of your solutions; you don't always follow up on your promising beginnings. The good news is that this is a perfect moment to change that old pattern. I dare you to endure boredom for the sake of a very good cause.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Your official role model for the coming weeks is the Vietnamese freedom fighter, Trieu Thi Trinh, who resisted the Chinese occupation of her country in the third century. Unlike her, you shouldn't literally raise a rebel army, establish your own sovereign enclave, and ride into battle against the invaders on the back of an elephant. (Although it's fine to do all that stuff metaphorically.) Like her, you should agitate for liberation with unstinting exuberance, as if your soul's health depended on it. I suggest you write her most famous utterance on a piece of paper and carry it with you everywhere you go: "My wish is to ride the tempest, tame the waves, kill the sharks. I will not resign myself."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Happy Valentine Daze, Aries! During my quest for the advice that might be most helpful to your love life, I gathered the following words of wisdom. 1. "There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness." -Friedrich Nietzsche. 2. "Love is not about losing freedom; it's about sharing freedom with a partner who's as talented a liberationist as you." -my friend Sarah. 3. "I hunger for your sleek laugh and your hands the color of a furious harvest. I want to eat the sunbeams flaring in your beauty." -Pablo Neruda.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Happy Valentine Daze, Taurus! After careful meditation about what suggestions might enrich your love life, I'm advising you to celebrate an Honesty Festival with the person you love best or with the person you want to love best. Speak from the depths as you reveal the hidden fears and longings and joys that have been unspoken until now. And let these words of wisdom from Thoreau be the motto that guides you: "Between whom there is hearty truth there is love."

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Happy Valentine Daze, Gemini! Have you heard of the Mile-High Club? Anyone can become a member. All you have to do is get jiggy in an airplane at least 5,280 feet above the earth. Another flamboyant group of pleasure-seekers is comprised of mountain-climbers who boink during their trek up Mt. Everest. Then there are the people who travel to far-flung spots where they have sex outdoors during total eclipses of the sun. I urge you to be inspired by their examples in the near future: Enjoy your own brand of adventurous eroticism. The astrological omens say it's a favorable time for lovemaking that breaks a taboo or two as it blows your mind in the best ways.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Happy Valentine Daze, Cancerian! As I meditated on what advice might purify and supercharge your love life, I got to thinking about a statement attributed to French poet Paul Valery. "Love is being stupid together," he said. There's an element of truth to this notion, but it's too corny and degenerate for my tastes. I prefer to focus on a more interesting and complete truth, which is this: Real love is being smart together. If you weave your destiny together with another's, he or she should catalyze your sleeping potentials, sharpen your perceptions, and boost your IQ. Your relationship should be a crucible in which you deepen your understanding of the way the world works. If you can't share your love with such a person this week, don't share your love with anyone.

In a Village Voice piece on New Yorkers' New Year's resolutions, Allison Sommers testified that she aspired to "recognize joy when it bites me in the ass." That so happens to be your main assignment during this season of love, Leo. It shouldn't be too hard: The bliss coming your way will not be of the elusive, ephemeral variety. It's got teeth, and won't be in the least shy about using them. Happy Valentine Daze!

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Happy Valentine Daze, Virgo! If you're like me, many of the most accomplished people you've known have the same blind spot: their intimate relationships. As brilliant as they may be as artists, scientists, fund-raisers, or humanitarians, they're dumb about how to carry on a thriving marriage or loving partnership. Their plight is typical of the rest of us as well. Though we may have mastered countless skills, we're likely to be relatively unripe in our ability to achieve closeness with another human being. That's the bad news, Virgo. The good news is that this Valentine season and the ensuing six weeks will be an excellent time for you to take dramatic steps to cure your own version of this ignorance.

Happy Valentine Daze, Libra! I hope you don't mind if I gush about how much you resemble an elegant Cabernet right now. In a sense you're a fermented intoxicant with the potential to loosen inhibitions, arouse delight, and promote conviviality. Or, to use the words of Thom Elkjer's wine review in the San Francisco Chronicle: You're like sniffing a fresh shot of espresso after a bite of dark chocolate; like a delicious flood of caramel zing and baking spices in the mouth that lingers forever. I say, take advantage of your nearly irresistible appeal.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Happy Valentine Daze, Scorpio! The three love offerings I have might be a challenge for you to receive in the same generous spirit with which I'm giving them. Nevertheless, the astrological omens suggest this is one of those rare times when you can truly benefit from their bracing advice. So here are my gifts, starting with an insight from author Zora Neale Hurston: "Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place." Your second oracle comes from writer James Baldwin: "Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within." My third offering is from novelist Iris Murdoch: "Love is the difficult realization that something other than oneself is real."

Happy Valentine Daze, Sagittarius! Borrowing the words of poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, I've prepared a love note for you to use as your own. Feel free to give it to the person whose destiny needs to be woven more closely together with yours. "I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you. I love you not only for what you have made of yourself, but for what you are making of me. I love you for the part of me that you bring out."

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Happy Valentine Daze, Capricorn! After careful meditation about what advice would be most likely to energize your love life, I've decided to make three suggestions. First, bring more boldness and daring to the part of your life where intimacy is of crucial importance. Second, take to heart the idea that loving another human being is an epic, heroic, monumental enterprise. Third, write down this quote from poet Delmore Schwartz and carry it with you for the next 14 days: "Love is the most difficult and dangerous form of courage. Courage is the most desperate, admirable, and noble kind of love."

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Happy Valentine Daze, Aquarius! I want to remind you, in case you've somehow forgotten, that you'll never be able to bask in the love you want to receive from another person until you master the art of loving yourself with great skill and imagination. I'll go so far as to say that it's pointless to search for a perfect partner if you're not already your own perfect partner. Here's what Buddha had to say about the subject: "You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself, but that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anyone, deserve your love and affection."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Happy Valentine Daze, Pisces! The astrological omens say that right now you need love more than you need food and drink. Not just any old kind of love, though: It has to be high-minded and mysterious, and neither sentimental nor tormented. Hoping to steer you towards what you really need, I'm offering you the poetic words of Pablo Neruda. Say or write them to the person whose destiny needs to be woven more closely together with yours: "Our love is like a well in the wilderness where time watches over the wandering lightning. Our sleep is a secret tunnel that leads to the scent of apples carried on the wind. When I hold you, I hold everything that is--swans, volcanoes, river rocks, maple trees drinking the fragrance of the moon, bread that the fire adores. In your life I see everything that lives."

According to tradition, St. Blaise is the patron saint of throats. During his feast day, which is celebrated this week, you're supposed to bless that part of your body. Even if you're not Catholic, I highly recommend that you partake in this observance. From an astrological perspective, you Tauruses have a special relationship with the throat. It's a source of power and grace for you, more so than for any other sign, and you should always jump at any excuse to honor it. Want some suggestions? Get a neck massage. Drink delicious elixirs. Sing songs that make you feel potent. Say what you mean and mean what you say. Invite a good kisser to demonstrate his or her skill all over that magic part of your anatomy.

Somewhere in the world is a tree that has been struck by lightning in such a way that the scorch marks show your initials. This is the week of all weeks when you could find that tree. Somewhere in this world, there is a treasure that has no value to anyone but you, and a secret that is meaningless to everyone except you, and a frontier that possesses a revelation only you know how to exploit. This is the week when you could stumble upon those things. Somewhere in this world, Gemini, there is a person who could ask you the precise question you need to hear in order to catalyze the next phase of your evolution. This is the week when you might run into that person.

It's a perfect moment to break with all the useless, burdensome, energy-sapping aspects of the past. A good place to begin is in the name for your sign: "Cancer" has got to go. There's no reason why you should tolerate having your astrological title be the same word as the killer disease. In fact, let's make a formal change. I invite you to send me your proposals for what to replace it with. Dolphin? Fount? Flux? Send your ideas to [email¬†protected] or P.O. Box 150628, San Rafael, CA 94915.

Is that paradoxical enough for you, Leo? I hope you can find a way to love riddles like that in the coming weeks. You have arrived at a point in your astrological cycle when mysterious conundrums and apparent contradictions--especially the kind that stretch your mind inside-out and upside-down--are the best possible nourishment for your soul.

Rural communities in southern Louisiana celebrate Mardi Gras with even more anarchistic exuberance than the festivities that take place in New Orleans. Roving gangs of masked revelers stop cars and good-naturedly demand money and gifts from drivers. Clowns with feathered headdresses knock on people's door after midnight begging for ingredients to make gumbo. Mardi Gras out in the sticks "is a lot like tickling," says professor of folklore, Barry Ancelet. "When you get tickled it makes you laugh, but it also makes you feel uncomfortable." I expect it'll be that kind of week for you, Virgo. No harm will be done in the end, and the "tickling" will loosen you up even if it sometimes annoys you.

Prenatal psychologists suggest that if a pregnant woman wants her unborn child to be a musician, she should listen to a lot of Mozart. If she hopes her offspring will grow up to be an architect, she should visit beautiful buildings. Since you are in a sense pregnant right now, Libra--germinating a brainchild that will ultimately become a source of joy and responsibility--I suggest you borrow that approach. Immerse yourself in stimuli that will imprint your future masterpiece with the best and brightest influences.

For the first time in thousands of years, grass is now growing year-round in Antarctica. Winter temperatures have risen nine degrees Fahrenheit in the last thirty years, allowing wild lawns to spread where there were once ice sheets. I see a comparable metamorphosis for you in the coming weeks, Scorpio. A once-barren or frozen landscape in your psyche will show signs of vibrant life. A part of your world that has been inhospitable will welcome you.

The U.S. government has pledged $350 million in aid for tsunami victims. That may seem like a lot until you realize it spends that much every two days to finance its war in Iraq. But before you unleash enraged howls of derision about these cockeyed priorities, ask yourself whether there's a comparable discrepancy in your personal realm. Is it possible you devote an excessive amount of your psychic energy to combative, judgmental, dismissive ruminations, and not nearly enough to healing thoughts? The moment you can guarantee that you're generating a hundred times more love than hate, you'll have clearance to rant unhypocritically about American militarism. P.S. It's time to make sure you're practicing what you preach in every area of your life.

Some of my best meditations unfold as I'm mountain biking in the wilderness. Today, for example, I channeled your horoscope while struggling up a steep patch of craggy mud in the chilly drizzle. In the early part of my ascent, I cursed my stupidity. Why was I forcing myself to endure this ordeal? But soon I lifted my gaze from the ground and noticed how the mist swathed the top of Mt. Tamalpais in the distance. A bird began singing a deliriously cheerful tune. I realized that I wasn't really that cold, and that the light rain felt sensual, not uncomfortable. I was surrounded by beauty and my body felt invigorated by the exertion. That's when I thought of you, Capricorn. My situation, I knew intuitively, was a perfect metaphor for your life in the coming week.

"Never let your sense of morals get in the way of doing what's right," advised science writer  Isaac Asimov. I nominate this to be your motto in the coming week, Aquarius. Adhering too closely to your habitual notions of good and bad could lead you astray in two ways: It could cause you to inflict unnecessary harm, and it could result in you missing out on a one-of-a-kind opportunity. I'm not saying you should be bad, just that you should avoid making generalizations based on past experience.

Two Americans, Faye Wachs and Eugene Kim, were scuba diving off the coast of Thailand when the tsunami hit on December 26. The water around them behaved oddly but they were unaffected. It was only when they surfaced sometime later that they realized an enormous disaster had unfolded while they were below. I urge you to meditate on their experience during the coming week, Pisces. Is there anything you can you do that would be the metaphorical equivalent of being safely underwater during a tidal wave? I don't mean to imply that you will be in literal danger. What I'm suggesting is that you enter so deeply into the coming changes that you become one with them; that way, they won't sweep you away.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It'll be a bumper car kind of week, Aries. As long as you stick to the designated course, you can expect lots of thuds, jolts, and caroms that won't hurt a bit. In fact, most of them will actually be fun even as they knock some sense into you. That's why you have cosmic permission to raise your normal quotas of raucous laughter, boisterous horseplay, and madcap adventures. For extra credit, sprinkle wacky accents and silly voices into your conversations.

For two years running, Little Yellow Jacket has been voted Bull of the Year by the rodeo circuit's top bull riders. During a five-year career, the 1,750-pound beast has bucked off 85 percent of his riders in an average of 2.8 seconds. No one has stayed on for longer than 8 seconds. I've selected him to be your power animal in the coming weeks, Taurus. You have a mandate to avoid being rounded up, roped, or ridden by anyone, even if you have to snort and foam at the mouth as Little Yellow Jacket does during his performances. "He has the kind of heart, desire, and athletic ability that true champions in any walk of life possess," says his owner. All you need to succeed at your assignment are the first two of those qualities.

Before the controversial comic Bill Hicks died, Jack Boulware asked him what he thought was funny. "The best kind of comedy to me is when you make people laugh at things they've never laughed at," said Hicks, according to Boulware's piece in the San Francisco Chronicle. That thought should be your inspiration in the coming weeks, Gemini. I don't care how you do it, but you've got to crack up about subjects that you have always taken very seriously. You might want to rent DVDs of comedians who are famous for their taboo-busting rants. Surf the Web hunting down jokes about your sacred cows. Sneak up on yourself and tickle your own ribs while in the throes of a fantasy about what you're scared of.

Global warming makes me sad. I'm opposed to it, and I wish we humans would take more drastic measures to minimize our role in it. But I also have to admit that part of me enjoys some of its consequences. The growing season is getting longer: I can eat the first green beans from my garden before the first day of spring. The weather is more consistently finer: My wintertime bike trips to the top of the mountain rarely freeze my eyelashes, as they once did. Sometimes I can even stroll on the beach in shorts in January. Your assignment in the coming week, Cancerian, is to do what I've done: Find something redemptive about an aspect of our rapidly changing world that normally makes you crazy.

"Boobs: I wish I had them. Not enough to buy them, though." So testified skinny actress Lara Flynn Boyle in the Globe, rejecting the idea of getting silicone implants. Take your inspiration from her clarity in the coming week, Leo. Identify one of your half-assed desires--a vague wish that chronically floats around the back of your mind--and renounce it forever. If necessary, have a no-nonsense conversation with yourself in which you discuss all the reasons why the satisfaction of that longing is not at all crucial to your happiness or well-being, and why, therefore, you will never again indulge in a serious fantasy about it.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Michigan is a major importer of trash, accepting more than five million tons per year in return for big payments. A landfill in the small town of Rockwood alone takes in a thousand tons of New Jersey's demolition debris every day. I know it might be tempting for you to get all Rockwood-like in the coming days, Virgo; you may imagine you can reap some long-lasting benefits from getting dumped on. But I say unto you: It ain't worth it. Whatever you think you can gain is meager compared to what you could lose.

Science writer David Bodanis says there are always so many fragments of spider legs floating in the air that you are constantly inhaling them wherever you go. I encourage you to think of this now and then in the coming week, Libra. Whenever you do, engage in the following meditation: Imagine that you are bolstering your power to weave metaphorical webs; fantasize that every day in every way you are building a silky network designed to help you get what you want; visualize yourself as being light and strong, like a spider.

The world's highest bridge recently opened for traffic in France. The Millau Viaduct soars over the Tarn River, reducing the driving distance between Paris and Barcelona by 60 miles. I hope to see a comparable innovation in your future, Scorpio. You need a monumental short cut that will let you cross safely and conveniently over a yawning abyss. Don't try to create it all by yourself. Enlist the help of the most soulful bridge-builders you can find.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Movie actress Kate Winslet is your role model this week, Sagittarius. In her 17 movies, she has played a staggeringly wide variety of characters, from an innocent romantic in Sense and Sensibility, to a spontaneity-loving free spirit in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, to a street-wise sewer rat for an upcoming claymation comedy called Flushed Away. Come to think of it, those are three of the many personas you might consider adapting in the coming days. Like Winslet, you should avoid typecasting as you keep yourself highly entertained in a dazzling array of colorful milieus.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Believing" in God is like "believing" in the taste of a peach without ever having tasted an actual peach. But what if I told you that you could actually commune with the Divine Wow through up-close, personal encounters that are as vivid and palpable as eating a peach? It's a distinct possibility for you in the coming weeks, Capricorn. The best way to increase your chances of having this heart-to-heart intimacy with Supreme Magic is, first, to want it very badly, and second, to unleash generous expressions of love as often as possible.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Emily, Madison, and Kaitlyn were among the most popular names for new baby girls last year, whereas Jacob, Ryan, and Nicholas were top choices for boys. Thevoiceofreason.com website notes that on the other hand, Condescensia, Crumpet, and Bucket were some of the least popular girl names, and Beelzebub, Humpty, and Scratch were the least favorite for boys. I hope you will ignore both extremes, Aquarius, as you select an additional new nickname or tag for yourself in the coming days. While the astrological omens suggest it's a good time to expand your self-concept, it's a bad time to be overly influenced either by the trends or by knee-jerk rebellions against the trends.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The Weekly World News reports that hell has a special pain-free section for masochists. The evidence comes from an S & M aficionado who traveled to this anomalous part of the nether realm during a near death experience. "There was no beating, no torture, no poking with blazing pitchforks--not even a decent smack in the face," testified Melissa Surkovsky. While I am definitely not predicting you will visit this place, Pisces, I must warn you that you may soon have a semi-comparable experience here on earth. As much as you might be tempted, you simply won't be able to indulge in any of your own masochistic tendencies. You may even have to endure something like what Surkovsky did: "I was taken to a well-lit chamber and placed in a comfortable reclining chair, then waited on hand and foot by demons who were so polite, it was annoying."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"When you reach the top, keep climbing." This Zen proverb is especially applicable to you, Aries. Though you may feel as if you've accomplished as much as you can for now, I assure you that even more progress is not only likely but desirable. So don't bask in the afterglow yet. Claim the once-impossible prize--even at the risk of being called greedy. In the process, you might finally break the taboo that you've been keeping a secret from yourself.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

More than 240,000 people died in the earthquake that struck Tangshan, China in 1976. The relief effort was negligible compared to the help that has arrived in response to the tsunami disaster of a few weeks ago. One explanation for the difference is that there has been a dramatic globalization of consciousness. People currently living on the planet are increasingly aware of how intimately interdependent we all are. Thirty years ago no one had heard of the butterfly effect--the theory that the flapping of a butterfly's wings in Japan can affect the weather in Texas. Now millions understand the principle. Your assignment in the coming week, Taurus, is to pursue this line of thought further than you ever have. In what way do events happening elsewhere in the world impact your personal life? What would it mean for you to take seriously the slogan, "Think globally, act locally?" (P.S. It might be time to start reading newspapers from outside of your country.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

In 1718, a top Lutheran official in Eisenach, Germany sent a letter to the town administrators of nearby Ostheim-vor-der-Rhoen, mandating them to choose a new priest for the local congregation. Due to human error, the mail didn't arrive until 2004, too late to fulfill its function. I regard this as an apt metaphor for a scenario that will soon unfold in your life, Gemini. You too will finally receive a long-delayed delivery. Unlike the German message that was 286 years tardy, however, yours won't be completely useless. On the contrary, it might be curiously fresh. In the big picture, its seemingly belated arrival may even be perfect timing.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Is it too late for you to make another New Year's resolution? Not according to my astrological analysis. In fact, I think it's a perfect time to conjure up a few resolutions with financial themes. Try saying this one aloud, Cancerian, and see how it feels: "I resolve to win the lottery this year." Or how about this: "I resolve to find wads of hundred-dollar bills that careless drug dealers have accidentally dropped on the sidewalk." Here's another that might suit you: "I resolve to make a fortune on eBay by selling deeds to real estate on the planet Venus." If none of those feels quite right, try this: "I resolve to spend the coming weeks filling the holes in my understanding about how to generate, save, and invest money."

Bibliophile Anne N. Marino loves the "welcoming mysteriousness" of those buildings where large collections of books are housed for public use. "Walking into a library," she wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle, "I'm filled with a sense of belonging; my mind becomes clear, my heart rate slows; I can think." Your assignment in the coming week, Leo, is to identify the places that make you feel like that, and then spend as much time as possible inside of them.

Eminem recently received a tribute from the Raelians, a UFO cult that preaches nonviolence. They bestowed the title of "honorary priest" on the hip-hop star for his anti-war video, "Mosh." Was he proud and pleased? I doubt it, though he and his camp had no comment. I imagine you'll soon be getting a similarly meaningless "reward" or unwanted recognition for your good work, Virgo. Don't get mad about it. Don't let it stir up your old fear that you will never get the understanding and appreciation you deserve. Instead, have faith that what I'm about to predict will come to pass: It may take a while, but you will eventually receive a truly gratifying payoff for your recent breakthrough.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

If I'm reading the astrological omens correctly, Libra, fun and games will be at a peak in the coming weeks. The hormones that induce playful experimentation will be at record levels, and you'll be as uninhibited and as unconcerned with people's reactions as it's possible for you to be. I hate to risk dampening your enthusiasm by even a miniscule amount, but I've got to mention one caveat. There may be a few people who resent your buoyant vitality. Be alert for their passive aggressive attempts at sabotage so you can craftily work around them.

In the years before scientists finally figured out the structure of DNA, physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger helped define the parameters of the quest. He theorized that the chromosome contains both the blueprint for life and the power to create what the blueprint delineates. Within this mysterious powerhouse, in other words, is both the "architect's plan and the builder's craft." I urge you to meditate on the chromosome as a metaphor for the work you have ahead of you, Scorpio. It's time for you to make or find something that will serve as both architect's plan and builder's craft in the coming months.

It's illegal for women to drive cars in Saudi Arabia. Religious fundamentalists there have managed to twist public policy to reflect their wacky beliefs. (Does that sound like any other country you know?) But one Saudi woman, Hanadi Hindi, has refused to be shut out of the fun of piloting her own vehicle: She learned to fly planes in Jordan, and has been hired by a billionaire Saudi prince to work for his private airline. I nominate her to be a source of inspiration for you, Sagittarius. If there is a desirable role to which you have been denied access, don't waste your time and energy fighting the problem: Simply leap to the next level.

Ludacris is "a well-rounded hedonist who pursues a balanced lineup of vices and addictions," says Nathan Rabin in his review of the hip-hop star's CD, The Red Light District. I suggest that you treat Ludacris as your partial role model in the coming week, Capricorn, even as you also regard him as your anti-role model. Here's what I mean: You should be a well-rounded hedonist, but not by pursuing vices and addictions. Instead, seek out excitement that resonates with your noblest ideals, pleasures that thrill your soul as well as your body, and blissful adventures that enhance the health of you and everyone else you encounter.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Before going to sleep last night, I studied your astrological aspects for the coming week and asked my dreams to send me clues about what information you needed in your horoscope. I awoke at dawn with the answer.  In my dream, I was at a mass birthday party for hundreds of Aquarians. Everyone was drinking tea made from an herb called Job's tears as the goth band Lake of Tears performed. Then I gave a poetic speech on how crying can achieve the same effect as orgasm. As the dream climaxed, I led everyone outside into the drizzly night. We looked skyward and let the raindrops drench our faces as we did a mass singalong of "Cry Me a River," each of us lost in a private ritual of relief and release.

According to U.S. News & World Report, 74 percent of the population believes that "if a prayer goes unanswered it probably didn't fit into God's plan." I hope you don't adopt such a wimpy attitude about your own divine petitions in the coming weeks. The way I understand the current astrological omens, God may ignore your pleas for now, but is not ultimately opposed to granting them. Frankly, I suspect that the Creator needs you to change something about yourself before you will get your wish.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You're like grass sprouting up through a crevice in a boulder, Aries; like a hawk that has built a nest on the roof of a swank penthouse. You even remind me of an indie rock band that has somehow cracked the Billboard charts without selling out. I don't know how you've managed it, but I congratulate you on your ability to be cagily opportunistic in difficult circumstances even as you remain true to yourself. Now comes the really hard part: staying humble, cultivating gratitude, renewing your commitment to unpretentious resourcefulness, and continuing to do all the other things that got you to where you are now.

Author Danny Cox is an "accelerationist," according to the promotional blurb on his website. His talent is to induce "faster movement, higher efficiency, and increased productivity." I call on you to be a different kind of accelerationist in the coming week, Taurus: one who inspires visions of the big picture, purges pettiness from all interactions, and agitates on behalf of the highest possible ideals. If that leads to faster movement, higher efficiency, and increased production, fine. If it doesn't, equally fine. Your assignment is to be a soul accelerationist, not an ego accelerationist.

In his book, Chronicles: Volume 1, famed Gemini bard Bob Dylan claims that he never wanted to be the voice of his generation, let alone a prophet of protest leading a charge to overthrow the corrupt empire. "I really was never any more than a folk musician who gazed into the gray mist with tear-blinded eyes," he writes. "My deepest dream was a house on a tree-lined block with a white picket fence, pink roses in the backyard." I believe many of you Geminis will thrive in the coming nine months if you pursue a similarly modest path. Beginning next November, you may be called on to raise some beautiful and benevolent hell, but in the short run I advise you to bolster your foundations with tender loving care.

Five hundred British art experts recently voted to determine the most influential art work of all time. Was it Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" or Michelangelo's "David"? No. The winner was "Fountain," the white porcelain urinal that Marcel Duchamp mounted in a gallery show in 1917. "It reflects the idea that the creative process that goes into a work of art is the most important thing," said one of the voters, Simon Wilson. "The work itself can be made of anything and can take any form." I nominate Duchamp's urinal to be the most potent symbol in your world in the coming weeks, Cancerian. May it inspire you to place fresh thinking above all other values. For the foreseeable future, the greatest beauty will originate in imaginative departures from the way things have always been done.

Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is the best Hollywood movie of 2004, said A.O. Scott in the New York Times. But Salon.com's Charles Taylor panned the film, calling it leaden and boring, "a compendium of every clich√© from every bad boxing melodrama ever made." I suspect that you will get equally contradictory reviews for your life and work in the coming week, Leo. For instance, some people may regard you as a magician who has transformed rot into splendor, while others may think of you as a dabbler with too much self-esteem. Both are wrong. More importantly, their opinions, whether good or bad, shouldn't concern you. Be your own judge.

The wife of lottery winner Jack Whittaker bemoans the day he struck it rich. Since collecting $113 million in 2002, he has been in trouble with the law constantly, and has wasted a lot of time gambling and hanging out at strip clubs. "I wish I would have torn the lottery ticket up," says Jewel Whittaker. Let's hope you handle your growing solvency with more aplomb, Virgo. My guess is that although you're not going to win the lottery this year, your luck and hard work will conspire to raise your disposable income. Don't let it make you too crazy.

In a recent study, researchers could not train blue jays to postpone their desire. After a thousand repetitions, the birds still kept gobbling down a tiny chunk of food instead of waiting a short time for a much bigger piece. Many scientists believe that humans are similarly hard-wired for instant gratification. If that's true, Libra, you must resist it with all your power in the coming week. A better, more substantial prize will soon become available if you can stop yourself from grabbing the meager treat that's in front of your nose right now.

Please don't buy 14 jars of petroleum jelly and smear the stuff all over yourself, the walls, and the furniture. On the other hand, Scorpio, I do recommend that you become as slippery as possible in the coming week, metaphorically speaking. Don't stay too long in one place, don't commit yourself to long-term plans, don't get stuck in dogmatic perspectives, and don't get pinned down, period.

Bush said, "I'm not going to negotiate with myself" about the issue, and avoided making a substantive response. I advise you to take the opposite tack in the coming week, Sagittarius. It's crucial that you negotiate with yourself profusely, maybe even debate and argue--though I hope you'll stop short of getting into a fight with yourself. The fact is, the life issues you're dealing with need vigorous input from all the voices in your head. Even the seemingly irrational ones must have their say in order for you to reach wise decisions.

"One of the strongest characteristics of genius is the power of lighting its own fire," wrote essayist John W. Foster. While you may not be a genius in the same way that Albert Einstein or Emily Dickinson were, Capricorn, I believe that one of your special talents deserves the title. The only problem is, you haven't consistently given that talent the nurturing it needs to flourish. Would you consider correcting this neglect in the coming weeks? No later than March 1, I hope you will put into action a disciplined, long-term plan to create a metaphorical greenhouse for this natural endowment of yours.

I won't go into the specifics of what they do, because I merely want you to steal the basic idea. Why? Because according to my reading of the astrological omens, it is now a perfect time for you to unleash your pent-up aggressions in a flagrant yet harmless ritual. You can of course do this any way you see fit, but here's my suggestion: Wander out into a wild place and hurl about 20 big rocks in the direction of heaven.

Three times recently I've been driving home after 11 p.m. when I've spied a strange scene unfolding at a neighborhood house. The couple that lives there has been sitting around a festively decorated table in the front yard. A group of maybe eight to ten other people has been with them, and they've all been drinking from champagne glasses, making boisterous toasts, laughing heartily, and singing loud songs. I've been tempted to crash their little parties; it's exhilarating to see such late-night outdoor merriment in drizzly 30-degree weather during the bleak post-holiday season. I propose that you make these weirdoes your role models in the coming week, Pisces. Let them inspire you to be lavishly celebratory, convivial, and cheerful, even in seemingly inhospitable circumstances.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You will probably have to reiterate an old argument this week; you'll have to return to a familiar problem and reprise a good fight you've fought before. For best results, don't betray any peeved impatience. Act as if you're offering your reasonable appeal for the very first time. On behalf of the universe, I apologize for sending you this maddening test. History is threatening to repeat itself in a distinctly unproductive way, and only your good-natured, enlightened use of force can stop it.

Even if it's cold where you live, I highly recommend that you spend quality time outdoors. Lovingly observe the behavior of animals and familiarize yourself with the rhythms of the moon; watch a river flow at night and take deep inhalations of the earth's aroma; learn the names of the different kinds of clouds and trees; sing a song to the sun. Simple acts of reverence like these will bring you into close alignment with mysteriously beneficent forces. Your luck and intuition will improve, as will your sense of timing. Why? The astrological omens say that nature wants you to get to know her better so she can pour more of her magic into you.

Last October I crammed all the fallen leaves from my mulberry tree into a garbage can, which I then hauled to a spot behind the garage and forgot about. Recently I rediscovered it. Though the temperature outside was in the 40s, the leaves inside the can were positively warm from the chemical changes going on as they rotted. Believe it or not, I immediately thought of you, Gemini. Metaphorically speaking, there is something similar going on in your life. The decay of the old stuff that you shed a few months ago is now generating a lot of energy. Can you somehow make use of it?

Renowned German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer admired the not-very-famous aphorist G. C. Lichtenberg. Schopenhauer referred to him as a "Selbstdenker," a German term for an independent spirit who truly thinks for himself. Your assignment in the coming weeks, Cancerian, is to aggressively cultivate your own skills as a Selbstdenker. To get started, I suggest you temporarily suspend your disbelief in ideas you've always considered exotic or outlandish, even as you suspend your belief in your most unquestioned dogmas. During this trial period, be skeptical about every influence you've regarded as authoritative, especially the cynical and skeptical ones. Keep in mind Lichtenberg's wise counsel: "The most dangerous of all falsehoods is a slightly distorted truth."

Leo (July 23-August 22)

A giant Wal-Mart now stands within a mile of the ancient Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuac√°n, Mexico. A KFC restaurant emits a steady surge of fried chicken fumes very close to Egypt's Sphinx. Meanwhile, near the most sacred place in your heart, Leo, there is a mound of psychic garbage. You can't do anything about the desecration of the first two places I mentioned, but you can about the third. I recommend that you take care of this little problem in the coming week. In addition to acts of cleansing and purification, I suggest you make a ritual atonement or two.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The Nike swoosh is a trademark symbol that has been imprinted on the subconscious minds of hordes of consumers, helping the company suck hundreds of millions of dollars into its coffers. A college student created it in 1971, charging Nike a mere $35. I think you may be in a somewhat comparable position, Virgo: on the verge of generating an idea or service or product that will ultimately yield bigger results and have greater value than you can imagine right now. Don't underestimate it; refuse to sell yourself short.

Joe Gibbs captured three Super Bowl victories as coach of football's Washington Redskins and won the Daytona 500 and Winston Cup as the owner of a NASCAR racing team. He has demonstrated considerable expertise in rousing the drive for excellence in his employees. According to him, there are three main things that motivate people in any business: fear, money, and sugar. What's your current proportion of each of those, Libra? The coming months will be an excellent time for you to revise your formula. Start now. Take both subtle and drastic steps to cut back on your levels of fear and pump up your levels of sugar.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Around the age of 17, students in Denmark take a standardized test that determines their educational fate and, ultimately, their career path. In an article in National Geographic, raconteur Garrison Keillor noted that teens who earn the very highest scores are eligible for the most prestigious occupations in Danish society: doctor, psychologist, and midwife. I urge you to remember the latter fact throughout 2005, Scorpio, because it will serve as a mnemonic device for my big prediction, which goes as follows: You will grow smarter in the coming year whenever you cultivate your power to heal, whenever you expand your understanding of the nature of the soul, and whenever you help birth the dormant potential in yourself and those you love.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"You can be the most intelligent, well-read, diligent person in the world and work at your poetry for 20 years and still be no good at it." That's what poet August Kleinzahler told the East Bay Express. He discourages his students from becoming poets; he says it's not so much a career as a disease. On the other hand, Sagittarius, I'd like to remind you that most other pursuits do reward hard work and dogged devotion. And it's a perfect moment for you to meditate on that fact, since you now have extraordinary power to make long-term commitments to good intentions. Is there any labor of love that the ambitious part of you can imagine spending the next 10 years perfecting?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Your symbol for the week is a sparrow flying low to the ground. Not an eagle soaring high over the treetops, not a hawk gliding on updrafts, but a small, humble bird whizzing along just inches above the turf. In other words, Capricorn, seek transcendence even as you remain down to earth. Be light, airy, and swift, but don't put yourself above the fray. Declare your independence from the more oppressive aspects of the law of gravity, but stay near the same level as the heavy, plodding creatures.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"I can't find nobody as crazy as me," mourns bluegrass singer Alison Krauss in her song, "Crazy as Me." You may have had that thought yourself on occasion, Aquarius, especially lately. But you don't have to feel that way anymore. More than one unusual character is hovering at the outskirts of your world. Say the word, and they will venture closer, raising your level of unpredictable experiences. That would mostly be a good thing, though not completely free of harrowing brushes with comic weirdness. Your watchword for the coming weeks comes from another singer, Thalia Zedek: "Trust not those...without some touch of madness."

Do it with a sly and artful ritual of transgression or do it with an exuberant burst of joyful release, but do it. The future is calling you too loudly to resist any longer.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
Machismo is a term that refers to the aggressive demonstration of stereotypical masculine qualities. Feminismo, on the other hand, signifies a potent expression of what are usually thought of as feminine traits. These include sensitivity, receptivity, emotional intelligence, a knack for nurturing others, a drive to create beauty, and a skill for building relationships. This will be important for you to keep in mind in the coming months, because 2005 will be the Year of Feminismo for both Aries men and women. Are you ready to supercharge your feminine qualities?

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

All of us have a dark side--a part of our psyches that is unripe, a bit crazed, and out of sync with our highest values. If you try to suppress it or deny its existence, it controls you surreptitiously. If you acknowledge its presence and cultivate a relationship with it, you may be able to harness some of its raw power for good causes. You've got to love it without overindulging it; give it voice without allowing it to possess you. I mention all of this, Taurus, because 2005 should be the year you dramatically upgrade and refine the role that your dark side plays in your life.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

To guide your journey in 2005, I've selected two quotes. I suggest you write them out and keep them in your wallet or under your pillow for the next ten months. The first is from mythologist Joseph Campbell: "The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe, to match your nature with Nature." Your second keynote comes from the ancient Chinese sage, Lao Tzu: "Stop leaving and you will arrive. Stop searching and you will see. Stop running away and you will be found." Now here's your homework, Gemini: Meditate on how these themes articulate two angles of approach to the same joyful work.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Since 1991, my Cancerian friend Jared has donated blood to a local blood bank 105 times. He volunteers as a big brother to fatherless kids and donates 20 percent of his salary to charity. Yet I've never once heard him ask anyone for help. Vanessa, another Cancerian friend, compulsively takes care of all her friends, bringing them home-cooked meals and thoughtful gifts whenever they're down. I know she suffers bouts of depression herself sometimes, but as far as I'm aware, no one brings her treats. Jared and Vanessa are going to be the poster children for my crusade to bring balance to your life in 2005. You simply must stop giving more than you receive; you've got to expand your capacity to accept assistance and blessings from other people.

This should be the year you devote yourself to the maddening and glorious details, Leo. I encourage you to dive into the mysteries of intricacy as you master the thousand and one practical matters that will ultimately make your dreams come true. You might want to memorize the following quote from philosopher William James: "I am done with great things and big plans, great institutions and big success. I am for those tiny, invisible loving human forces that work from individual to individual, creeping through the crannies of the world like so many rootlets, or like the capillaries."

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I'm not given to extravagant tastes, but I do allow myself one unreasonable habit: a craving for organic grapes in the wintertime. If they're available in the stores at all, two bunches of pesticide-free Concords can set me back as much as a three-course meal at my favorite Thai restaurant. But they're good for me, and I'm pretty self-controlled the rest of the time, so I regard my appetite for the grapes as an acceptable form of self-indulgence. I mention this, Virgo, because I believe you have cosmic permission in 2005 to raise your quota of healthy greed. In fact, I suggest you brainstorm right now about the salubrious pleasures you plan to demand more of in the coming months.

"Curiosity did not kill the cat," reports John Olson in Free Stream Velocity, his book of prose poems. "Boredom killed the cat." Let that be your rallying cry in 2005, Libra. In the coming months you will have a sacred duty to elude all situations that make your eyes glaze over. To meet your dates with destiny, you must not tolerate BLAH or HO-HUM in any form. "Curiosity was born with the universe," Olson reminds you. "It redeems and is erotic."

Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of India's greatest mathematical geniuses. He lacked formal training and his work was thought peculiar by his fellow mathematicians, but he made dramatic breakthroughs that are highly regarded. He attributed his success to the Hindu goddess Namakkal. She appeared regularly in his dreams, where she revealed innovative formulas he had only to verify when he awoke. I hereby appoint Ramanujan to be your official role model for 2005. May he inspire you in your quest to establish a practical alliance with a benevolent deity, imaginary friend, or guardian angel. If I'm reading the astrological omens correctly, this ally will provide you with a steady stream of useful clues about how to fulfill the mission you came to earth to carry out.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Before the U.S. election a few weeks ago, What Is Enlightenment? magazine posed the following query to five religious leaders: "Many people argue that the upcoming presidential election is the most important in our lifetime. Do you agree?" Four respondents said, in effect, "Yes, because Bush is bad for America and the world." But the fifth, Zen Buddhist Jan Chozen Roshi, replied, "I don't know. Our existence is so short, it's like a dust mote in the eye of God. To say that the time in which my dust mote existed was the most important is a self-centered view." Jan Chozen Roshi's wisdom reminded me of an anecdote told by Henry Kissinger. Kissinger once asked Chinese premier Zhou Enlai what he thought of the French Revolution, which had happened two centuries earlier. "Too soon to tell," Chou answered. Keep these stories in mind in 2005, Sagittarius. Think often of long-term processes. Focus on the very big picture.

Get in the habit of imagining yourself as the star of a hero's journey. For extra credit, heed the advice of Ralph Waldo Emerson: "Make your own Bible. Collect all the words and sentences that in your reading have been like a blast of triumph."

"Irregularity and unpredictability are important features of health," wrote John R. Van Eenwyk in his Quest magazine article, "The Chaotic Dynamics of Everyday Life." "On the other hand," he continued, "decreased variability and accentuated periodicities are associated with disease. Healthy systems don't want homeostasis. They want chaos." Do you dare act as if this is true, Aquarius? Do you have the courage to live with greater uncertainty, knowing that it's good for you? The coming year will be a perfect time to figure out how to change your mind in such a way so as to accomplish this noble trick.

A study at McGill University concluded that moms and dads who launch screaming fights in front of their kids may actually be helping them. Listening to their parents yelling often makes children more imaginative because it forces them into a fantasy world to escape. Can you think of similar reversals in your own life, Pisces--difficult events that have ultimately served you? The coming year will be an ideal time to redeem these gifts from the past. Be constantly on the lookout for ways you can use old traumas and setbacks as sources of inspirational power.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your assignment in 2005 is to wage a revolution in the sphere where you have the most power. Your home? Your marriage? Your workplace? Local government? Wherever it is, Aries, arm yourself with tact and compassion as you overthrow the stale status quo by manifesting your shining ideal. Let this advice from Buckminster Fuller serve as your touchstone: "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."

I'll send many suggestions your way in the coming months, Taurus. Some of them will ring true to you, and others may not. Some will be evocative clues you'll meditate on for days, while others may fade from your awareness right after you read them. Through it all, there will be two constants. First, every horoscope will be offered to you in a spirit of love. Second, you will always be free to take it or leave it. And now I present what I consider the most important advice for you to keep in mind throughout 2005, though only you can decide if it actually is: Consistently cut away the smaller, weaker buds in order to direct all the forces of growth into the few buds most likely to succeed.

Am I afraid of sounding too extravagantly optimistic as I deliver my predictions for your year ahead? Well, yes, a little. But I think you can handle it. Besides, there is a caveat: Since even the arrival of good news can be stressful, you may have to struggle at times to deal with all the positive changes that are on the way. Here's an example: I believe 2005 will be your Year of Mind-Wobbling, Heart-Opening Adventures in Love. To receive the fullness of the demanding gifts you'll be offered, you'll probably have to make big adjustments in your habitual behavior.

Here's an odd paradox about your fate in 2005: You will get as close to your true home as you have ever been, and yet you'll also be teased and intrigued by a provocative mystery. Let me say it another way: More than at any other time in your life, you will feel like you truly belong here--and yet you'll often be amazed at how enigmatic everything is. I'll give you one more angle on the confounding security that will visit you in the coming months: You'll have an uncanny sense of being cared for by a mother goddess, even as you keep delving further than ever before into the riddles of your unpredictable destiny.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Last month, a religious fanatic in Taiwan decided to reach out to a previously neglected group of heathens. At a zoo, he leaped into a lion's den and began trying to convert the beasts to the Christian faith. "Jesus will save you!" was one of his oft-repeated exhortations. The lions seemed enraged by his appeals, and it was only through the heroic efforts of the zookeepers that the crusader was saved from martyrdom. Let him serve as your anti-role model in 2005, Leo. Work diligently to spread your good intentions; be brave in promoting your high ideals; ramp up your powers of persuasion to a new level; but don't waste your time trying to win over dumb beasts, bad listeners, and narrow-minded dogmatists.

Marilynne Robinson published her first novel, Housekeeping, in 1982. It was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and an influential critic called it one of the ten best novels of the twentieth century. This November, 22 years later, Robinson came out with her second work of fiction, Gilead. "Writing is like praying," she told Carin Besser in The New Yorker Online. "In both, if they are to be authentic, grace and truth must discipline thought." I nominate Robinson to be your patron saint in 2005, Virgo. May she inspire you to produce another gem like the one you did some years ago. May her example give you the faith to work as slowly as you need to in order to remain impeccable, allowing grace and truth to discipline your thought.

A four-year-old artist from Binghampton, New York has sold 25 of her paintings, earning $40,000. Marla Olmstead's works have been compared to those of Wassily Kandinsky and Jackson Pollack, and many have appeared in galleries. One critic wrote, "Painting with fingers, spatulas, and brushes, and using plastic mustard bottles to squirt out acrylics, she creates textured, abstract landscapes laden with emotion, depth, and real talent." I'm naming Marla as your official role model for 2005, Libra. I expect the youngest part of you to blossom, unleashing frequent bursts of creativity.

A few years ago East Timor was described as an "unimaginable, apocalyptic ruin" by UN peacekeepers. More than 200,000 people had died during a 25-year struggle to separate from Indonesia. But after finally gaining its independence, the new nation is now prospering in peace. With this as your inspiration, Scorpio, identify the most intractable and painful problem in your life. Now imagine that in the next ten months, you will transform it as dramatically as the people of East Timor did theirs.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

One of your main assignments in 2005 is to cultivate your sense of wonder. It's true that you already possess a more acutely developed sensitivity to marvels and miracles than most of the other astrological signs, but you still have a way to go to reach your highest potential. With this in mind, I'll ask you to make 52 appointments with yourself in the coming year. They could be at noon every Monday, or whatever time you choose. During each meeting, you will renew your commitment to seeing with fresh eyes. You'll vow to be alert for previously unnoticed delights lurking in the midst of your familiar surroundings. You'll promise yourself to seek out experiences that teach you things you don't know.

Then the man asked, "How much money is a million dollars to you?" "A penny," God said. "Can I borrow a penny?" the man asked. "Sure," God said, "in a second." Here's my interpretation of this anecdote: God was struck by the man's greed and decided to have a joke at his expense. Now if you, on the other hand, Capricorn, are less grandiose in your financial requests for 2005, I believe God will be pretty responsive.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

The planetary omens for 2005 are unambiguous: You've got to spend more time in nature. For the sake of your physical and mental health, you must escape the familiar confines of your comfy cages--must wander out into wild places that are far from plastic, concrete, bricks, and glass. Your Official Maxim of the Year comes from essayist Edward Dahlberg: "Man is at the nadir of his strength when the earth, the seas, the mountains are not in him, for without them his soul is unsourced, and he has no images by which to abide." In the coming months, Aquarius, find a way to get the earth, the seas, and the mountains inside you.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The coming year will be prime time for you to reinvent your conception of and relationship with God. The best way to begin this fun project is to throw away everything you think you know about the subject and start from scratch. Why not imagine a Divine Creator who is wild and free, who inhabits both the dark and the light, who exudes mystery as well as goodness, who heals with strange beauty as much as with sweet insight, and who gives you puzzles that bring you to the brink of crazed excitement, at which point you break through into a higher way of knowing-an almost sensual contact with a marvelous, difficult, entertaining God?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In 1874, a fire broke out in an underground coalfield in western China. It burned nonstop until 2004, when firefighters finally squelched it. In the intervening 130 years, 200 million tons of fuel went to waste, spewing out copious amounts of polluting gases. I nominate the denouement of this long-running drama to serve as your personal metaphor for early 2005. In January and February, you will finally douse a smoldering inner fire that has been a poor use of your ambition. This will set the stage for a fresh start. No later than your birthday, you will ignite a new blaze that's both more efficient and more worthy of you.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Have you heard of the book, Toxic Sludge Is Good for You!: Lies, Damn Lies and the Public Relations Industry? How about George Orwell's science fiction novel, 1984, in which the government trumpets the slogan, "War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength"? If I could, I'd give you these books as holiday gifts, Taurus. I'd also present you with an altar made of fine wood. With these foundation materials, I'd ask you to begin building a Truth Shrine in your home. This source of power might help you stay alert for and immune to the elevated levels of BS you'll be called on to fend off in 2005. Maybe it would also inspire you to be in service to us all as you earn the title of "Radical Truth-Teller."

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

As I meditated about what would be the perfect holiday gift for you, I kept coming back to the fantasy of a thousand doughnuts. Nothing pleased me more than the mental image of your living room floor covered with boxes of Bavarian cream, chocolate frosted, jelly-filled, glazed, and apple crumb doughnuts. Here's the astrological explanation for my intuition: I think fate plans to blow your mind with sweet extravagance in 2005. Receiving a thousand doughnuts would be a metaphorical rehearsal.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Over the centuries, numerous ships carrying treasure have suffered mishaps and sunk to the bottom of the world's oceans. Most have remained there undisturbed, their gold and jewels seemingly lost forever. In the last decade, though, teams of treasure hunters have developed high-tech recovery equipment that allows them to locate and extract the sunken riches. I believe that there will be a comparable development in your life in the coming months, Cancerian. You'll find ways to access valuables from the past--stuff you had always assumed was irretrievable. Your first project will become apparent soon. Here are a few symbolic holiday gifts you might consider buying yourself: sonar, a diving suit, a treasure chest.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Many spiritual teachers say you're most likely to succeed at meditation if you sit quietly in a sanctuary. They believe you need to retreat from the world in order to develop compassionate objectivity about life. The eighteenth-century Zen Buddhist teacher Hakuin Ekaku had a different view. "Meditation in the midst of activity is a billion times superior to meditation in stillness" was his motto. I agree with him. But one of the reasons it's superior is because it's so much harder. Have you ever tried to see God in your boss while he or she is yelling at you about some trivial mistake? Are you able to remain open-hearted to a loved one when he or she isn't being open-hearted to you? Believe it or not, Leo, you could go a long way towards mastering these skills in 2005. It'll be prime time to learn how to meditate in the midst of the daily chaos.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Virgo rapper Xzibit was asked by an interviewer what he was hoping to get for Christmas. "All I want is a Hummer H2, a big-ass plasma TV, and a AR15 assault rifle with a 30-round clip." Though your own holiday wish list may not include any of Xzibit's items, I do encourage you to fantasize extravagantly about what gifts might pump up your power in 2005. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you should even let yourself entertain some rather macho trains of thought as you imagine the enhancements you'd like to bring with you into the new year. How about sessions with a hard-driving life coach, lessons in ashtanga yoga, or a definite plan to undertake a brave outdoor adventure?

Libra (September 23-October 22)

In 2005, you should go to great lengths to put yourself in positions where you will be pleasantly surprised, profoundly taught, and rigorously inspired. The coming months will be an excellent time to seek out experiences that will change your mind about many things. You're finally ready to shed a slew of old attitudes and beliefs that worked well for you once upon a time, but which are now mostly dead weight. Here are some symbolic holiday gifts you might consider buying yourself: a blank slate, a bottle of baptismal water, an outfit of all white clothes.

No one knows you better than you do, Libra. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

This year the Boston Red Sox won baseball's World Series for the first time in 86 years. The team thereby dispelled "The Curse of the Bambino," which had plagued the franchise since it traded away Hall of Famer Babe "Bambino" Ruth in 1918. Of the 25 players on the Red Sox roster in 2004, five were Scorpios and five were Geminis. The Scorpios included four premier talents who were instrumental in breaking the curse: Johnny Damon, David Ortiz, Curt Schilling, and Pedro Martinez. I believe this vignette foreshadows your fate in 2005, Scorpio. You too will banish a jinx that has burdened you for far too long. And Geminis (like Boston's star Manny Ramirez) may be valuable allies. Here's a symbolic holiday gift you might consider buying yourself: a Boston Red Sox good luck charm.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In 2005, I hope you seek out more demanding and rewarding alliances. I'd love you to align yourself with a network that spreads your highest values with maximum intensity. My heart will also sing with joy if you use better tools to express your generous urges and try more daring strategies to promote justice. To encourage these developments, consider getting yourself these holiday gifts: a device that enhances your ability to communicate, a pep talk from the most practical idealist you know, and a talisman that symbolizes a promise you make to your future self.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"I have climbed to the top of a greasy pole." So proclaimed nineteenth-century politician Benjamin Disraeli when he had at last ascended to the job of prime minister of Great Britain. Please picture that greasy pole in your mind's eye, Capricorn. I would love to give it to you as a holiday gift. It would be an apt symbol for the work you have ahead of you in 2005. P.S.: I expect to see you at the top by next October.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Last January, NASA landed two vehicles on Mars. For months their solar panels provided them with just enough energy to explore the alien terrain. One of the rovers recently experienced an inexplicable power boost, however. It happened overnight, and NASA's team isn't sure why. "We surmise that for some reason dust is being removed from the solar panel," said spokesman Jim Ericson, "and that's increasing the efficiency of the sunlight being converted to electricity." I regard this as an apt metaphor for what lies in your future Aquarius. In 2005, you too will enjoy mysterious rejuvenations as you reconnoiter exotic territory.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In my imagination, I'm now handing you a battle flag similar to those carried by the armies of medieval Europe. It's a windsock in the shape of a red, winged dragon with black eagle claws and a long yellow tail. Inside it is a device that unleashes a loud, raucous whistle whenever the wind blows through it. In presenting you with this symbolic gift, I'm exhorting you to pump up your martial forces in 2005. I'm encouraging you to be wild-hearted and strong-willed as you fight the good fight.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

According to my reading of the astrological omens, you need to feel high levels of both reverence and exuberance in the coming week. You'll thrive whenever you can experience awe and rowdy happiness in the same setting. Here's one possible way to achieve that: Dance in a church, synagogue, mosque, oak grove, mountaintop, or meditation sanctuary. Take a boom box or Walkman with you, and move your beautiful body with sacred, uproarious grace.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

I almost always discourage you from feeding your anxieties. The worrisome specters that sometimes eat away at your imagination only rarely have much resemblance to what's actually happening. But I'm going to make a departure from my usual practice this week. During the brief transition period ahead, your fears have the potential to make you stronger and wiser. You will find power in marshaling measured responses to any influence that seems to oppose you. Here's the paradox: You're not in any real danger, but it will be useful for you to act as if you are.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Your horoscope this week is brought to you by Wendell Berry's poem, "Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front," which appeared in his book, The Country of Marriage. Thanks to Mr. Berry for his generous grant of soul power. It's the perfect gift for you during your unbirthday season, when you have a mandate to go against the grain and against the flow. Here's an excerpt from Berry's poem. "Friends, every day do something that won't compute. Love someone who does not deserve it. Denounce the government and embrace the flag. Give your approval to all you cannot understand. Ask the questions that have no answers. Put your faith in the two inches of humus that will build under the trees every thousand years. Laugh. Be joyful though you have considered all the facts. Practice resurrection."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

One of my favorite prophets, John Hogue, thinks you Crabs can get lost in your dreamy visions at the expense of your commitment to the real world. Your karmic lesson, he says, is to "transcend your attachments to sweet but isolating illusions." I believe the coming months will offer you an excellent chance to accomplish this. If you're open to the truth, the real world will actually be more fun and interesting than your fantasy world. And the week ahead will provide you with a vivid opportunity to start the transition.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Playing off the concept of deja vu, comedian George Carlin has proposed a variation: vuja de, or "the uncanny feeling that none of this has ever happened before." Write that term on the back of your hand, Leo. Imprint it on your mind's eye. Vuja de will be your operative theme for the coming week. You'll be inundated by a flood of fresh, hot novelty. You'll see events you've never seen and feel emotions that maybe no one in the history of the planet has ever felt. If you're ever tempted to repeat yourself or get bogged down in familiarity, stop what you're doing immediately. Take full advantage of this unprecedented chance to cultivate beginner's mind.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I turn your attention to Cory Doctorow's review of Neal Stephenson's three-volume "Baroque Cycle." Writing for Boingboing.net, Doctorow says Stephenson's books are like good curry. "They're mild and interesting when you first taste them, but after you've swallowed, they grow on you, spreading a warm fire throughout your digestive system, making beads of sweat appear on your forehead." This happens to be an excellent description of the experiences you'll be invited to enjoy in the coming week, Virgo. They'll go down easy and ultimately make you hot with inspiration.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

In a past incarnation, it's possible that you were imprisoned or burned at the stake for expressing your beliefs. That might help explain why you're sometimes reluctant to speak your mind with total candor in this life. But you can't afford to let that ancient inhibition rule you now, Libra. Somehow you've got to find the courage to express your core truths with sustained, unflinching clarity. To do so won't lead to a punishment nearly as severe as what you suffered in that previous lifetime, but there may still be a bit of hell to pay. The tradeoff, which will strengthen your soul in ways you can't imagine, will be well worth it.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The entrance to my local post office is an odd set of double doors. One of the doors is of normal width, but the other is bizarrely narrow, like something out of Alice in Wonderland. The only way I can use it is to turn sideways and squeeze through it. I believe this is an apt symbol for the metaphorical door you will have to negotiate in the coming week, Scorpio. As you approach it, you may feel bothered by its illogical and inconvenient construction. You may even be inclined to take it personally, as if it were an affront to your dignity. Avoid those reactions. Just turn sideways and squeeze through as best as you can, suppressing the urge to bitch and complain. That will prepare you perfectly for the weird but good luck that awaits you on the other side.

No one knows you better than you do, Scorpio. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Let's say, hypothetically, that you came into possession of an instrument that might allow you to wield supernatural power: a magic wand, for example, or an Aladdin's lamp, or ruby slippers like the kind Dorothy had in the story of the Wizard of Oz. But let's also hypothesize that the instrument had a quality that made it problematic for you to use: maybe the wand was six feet long, weighed 200 pounds, and was hard to pick up, let alone wave around; or perhaps the ruby slippers were much too small to fit on your feet. What then? I suspect that the vignette I just outlined is an apt metaphor for the dilemma you will soon face. There is a solution that will allow you to tap into the mojo of the magic instrument, but you'll have to be dogged and ingenious to discover it.

Ernest Hemingway didn't find it easy to let go of his novel, A Farewell to Arms. He revised the last page 39 times. Like Hemingway, Capricorn, you have been displaying a bit of obsessive-compulsive behavior as you put the finishing touches on your long-term projects. But according to my understanding of the astrological omens, you shouldn't allow closing time to last beyond December 18. Please try to wrap everything up by then. If there are still a few messy details that are driving you half-crazy on December 19, forget about them as best as you can.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

It's always a smart idea to be kind, but especially so right now. Your benevolent acts are desperately needed by the people whose lives you touch. Being generous is also important for the sake of your own selfish needs; you won't meet your appointed date with destiny unless you're unrestrained in doling out blessings. By the way, kindness is much more than doing nice, polite deeds. It's also about stirring up surprising acts of beauty, imaginative eruptions of love, catalytic breakthroughs of justice, and artful expressions of liberation.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I am pleased to inform you that you have been granted a special dispensation in the coming week: a temporary exemption from cosmic compulsion. During this grace period, fate will have a dramatically reduced power to whip you around like a rag doll in a gale. You will be virtually immune to the ravages of peer pressure, guilt trips, and the nagging little voices in your head. While it is of course impossible to completely escape the tyranny of the clock, you will experience a release from the most ignominious debilitations of that tyranny. In fact, you may have more free will than you've ever had before. In the days ahead, playtime is never over.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The seeds of some trees are so tightly compacted within their protective cones that only flames can free them and allow them to sprout. The lodgepole pine and jack pine can't reproduce, in other words, without the help of forest fires. I suspect that you will have a resemblance to those fire-dependent, fire-resistant seeds in the coming months, Aries. Your ability to prosper and flourish may require you to spend time in the metaphorical equivalent of a large blaze. Don't worry for your sanity or safety. Just as the seeds in jack pine cones can tolerate temperatures of 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit, you will be very hardy. P.S. Your first trial by fire may begin any minute now.

Your soul is the best friend you keep forgetting you have. It's closer than your breath and older than death. It dreams like a mountain, laughs like a river, and communicates with you in the exuberantly mysterious style of animals and gods. You are alive because of your soul! It loves you with nonstop unconditional ingenuity. Isn't it right, then, to devote at least one special day each year to honoring it and giving thanks for its blessings? From an astrological perspective, this is a perfect time to do just that. Schedule Soul Celebration Day for sometime this week.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

It's an excellent time for you to fuel your urge to compete. But wait! Before you start working yourself into a frenzy about your rivals and adversaries, before you erupt with a surge of jealous fantasies, read this quote from ballet superstar, Mikhail Baryshnikov: "I do not try to dance better than anyone else. I only try to dance better than myself." That's the special kind of competitive zeal I advise you to stoke in the coming weeks, Gemini.

"Centuries of travel lore suggest that when we no longer know where to turn, our real journey has just begun." So says Phil Cousineau in his book, The Art of Pilgrimage: The Seeker's Guide to Making Travel Sacred. I hope that's a perfect description of your current state, Cancerian. It may not be obvious yet, but losing your direction is the best gift you could have possibly been given. Being unsure of your next move is a crucial development in your life story, and a virtual guarantee that you will be in the right place at the right time for a divine intervention a few weeks from now.

One good way to celebrate your astrological Season of Rapture would be to acquire the book Sexual Energy Ecstasy: A Practical Guide to Lovemaking Secrets of the East and West, by David and Ellen Ramsdale. Carry out any of the exercises between pages 333 and 339, including these: 1. Imagine that your house is burning down around you while you're making love; you're too blissfully engrossed to flee, and die in each other's arms. 2. As you make love, imagine you're dreaming, and will soon wake up. 3. Imagine that your lover's face keeps changing, becoming the faces that he or she had in past incarnations. 4. Make love with paper bags over your heads. Cut out holes for your eyes and mouths.  5. Imagine that you're making love to Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalene, Buddha, Tara, Kwan Yin, Krishna, Parvati, or some other enlightened one.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Don't fight the inevitable. Don't resist it and bitch about it and curse it. On the other hand, don't just lie down and let it roll on over you, relinquishing your will and losing your spunk. Instead, Virgo, have fun with the inevitable. Tease it and question it. Influence it through the ingenuity of your playfulness. Develop a relationship with it that allows you to be true to yourself even as you learn to love it.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

My house isn't big enough to hold all my stuff, so I keep some of it at a local storage facility. My room there is number 417. It's in the middle of a long hall lined with rooms that other people have rented for their junk. The sequence of numbered doors is odd; it goes 415 to 416 to 417 to 752 to 418 to 419 to 420. How did 752 get in there? It's a mystery--sort of like your life in the coming week, Libra. I predict that you'll soon experience a comparable interruption in the orderly flow of things. But that shouldn't be a problem for you as long as you don't worry about it. I suggest that you just glide through the seemingly out-of-place event, having faith that the regularly scheduled flow will return after a relatively brief blip.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In 1964, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson declared an unconditional "war on poverty." It was an enlightened use of martial force--an unprecedented attempt to channel the macho might of the federal government into an onslaught of benevolence. Now I call on you to pull off a comparable trick. In the coming weeks, convince your inner warrior to turn away from all temptations to express rage and destruction. Reprogram him or her to fight wildly in behalf of beauty, truth, justice, and love.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)
Be here now. That's usually pretty good advice. It means reeling your mind in from its distracted daydreaming about the past and future so that you can be fully attentive to the present moment. To really be here now, you have to stop fantasizing about what might happen or what could have been, and instead focus on what's actually unfolding right in front of you. Having said all that, however, I'm going to give you astrological permission to spend an inordinate amount of time in the coming week following a different mandate. For a limited time only, Sagittarius, you can and should be there then: Vividly imagine yourself in a desirable future scenario as if it were already happening. Feel the feelings you'll have when it materializes.

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In his book, The Secrets and Mysteries of Hawaii, Pila Chiles recounts the advice given him by an Indian holy man: "If you have lost the business, your house, and wife, after you have been pronounced terminally ill and life has dealt you the worst blows, there is only one duty left. That is to crawl over to the nearest mirror, hoist yourself up, look deeply into it with your last breath, and say aloud seven times: 'Cock-a-doodle-doo!'" No matter how low you might feel, Capricorn, you have to admit that your problems aren't even one percent as serious as that. You should find it relatively easy, then, to go to a mirror right now and crow "cock-a-doodle-doo!" seven times. Please do.

Dr. Ivan Goldberg (http://psychcentral.com/maniaquiz.htm) has created a questionnaire to help excitable people stay alert for when they may be about to go over the edge. For instance, he advises them to be wary if they're thinking things like, "My mind has never been sharper," "I need less sleep than usual," "I have more new ideas than I can handle," "I have been feeling particularly playful," or "I have been feeling like 'the life of the party.'" The weird thing is, Aquarius, that you're expressing many of the symptoms he names, only in you it's a sign of extraordinary vitality. Now please tap into the generosity and joy you've got in such abundance right now, and make the following affirmation, which is number 15 on Goldberg's list: *I have special plans for the world.*

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

For far too long, Pisces, you have been overly tolerant of sober, solemn approaches. You have allowed business-like people with a lack of emotional riches to define important questions. You have acted as if the absurdly literal mindset that views everything in black and white is strong and authoritative. What better time than now, therefore, to launch a strike in the name of irreverence, hilarity, and wildly poetic justice?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Sometimes it's just not worth trying to gnaw through the leather straps; you're better off accepting your bondage, saving your energy, and escaping into daydreams. But in the coming weeks, Aries, you should definitely strive to chomp through the leather straps. In fact, you're likely to have excellent results whenever you do anything to wriggle out of your "mind-forg'd manacles," slip away from your volunteer slavery, or break free from your self-imposed incarceration. When you look back on your life from the perspective of next year, you will probably call December your Month of Liberation.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"The basic difference between an ordinary person and a warrior," wrote Carlos Castaneda, "is that a warrior takes everything as a challenge while an ordinary person takes everything either as a blessing or a curse." Maybe you consider yourself an ordinary person, Taurus, and therefore think Castaneda's definition of a warrior has no meaning for you. But I'm here to tell you that the astrological omens say you will have to be a warrior in the coming weeks, even if you're usually not. So please act as if every experience will have the potential to be an interesting, invigorating challenge.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Taurus? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)
San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick LaSalle described the movie Van Helsing as "what a chimpanzee might do with an Etch A Sketch." I suspect that someone in your sphere has recently produced something similar--perhaps a bad work of art, a botched business deal, or an awkward relationship. It's not necessarily your sacred duty to try to make this mess more beautiful, and you certainly shouldn't try to prop it up or pretend it's well-done. But I do believe you should create something better to compensate for it--much better. Though almost anything you come up with will look good in comparison, you can't afford to merely act like a smarter chimpanzee with a more deluxe Etch A Sketch.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Psychologist James Hillman says that taking action to correct social and economic injustice in the world can serve as powerful psychotherapy. In some cases, it may even be a more effective way to transmute one's personal pain than talking endlessly about the pain with a therapist. That thought is the seed of my advice for you, Cancerian. In the coming weeks, the sure cure for your problems--even your most uncomfortable enigma--is to take your mind off yourself and summon all your emotionally rich ingenuity to help others.

Want more clues, Cancerian? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In honor of your entrance into the Season of Romance, I've written you a love poem. Here it is. Be my slow-motion dance. Be my birthday earthquake. Be my ripe pomegranate floating in a blue plastic swimming pool on the first day of winter. Be my handstand on a barstool, my whirlwind week in clown school, my joke shared with a Siberian shaman while shopping for socks at Wal-Mart. Be my puzzle with one piece missing. Be the waves crashing on a beach in the south of France in the twenty-second century. Be my golden hammer resting on the moss of a ten-million-year-old rock.

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Leo? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In the film Catch Me If You Can, a character played by Christopher Walken tells a story that illustrates persistence under duress. "Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream," he begins. "The first mouse gave up and drowned. The second mouse wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out." I urge you to make that second mouse your role model in the coming days, Virgo. Can you summon that much courage, stamina, and strength of will? The astrological omens say you can.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I suggest that you refer to yourself as "we" rather than "I" for the next couple of weeks. There is a power struggle going on among your various sub-personalities, and the best way to keep some of them from going berserk and doing something irrational is to treat them all equally. In fact, I suggest that you give each of them a name. Make each of them feel special. Then sit down with them in a big summit conference. Clear the air. Create an environment that fosters freedom of expression. Listen attentively as each of your many selves describes his or her needs, and try to come up with a plan that satisfies everyone.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

This is one of those odd turning points when you have a license to be a cute brat in charge of mischievous healing. I dare you to stir up the exact kind of trouble that will make everyone feel better. It's also a good time to start benevolent rumors, break out in song during committee meetings, and push your own buttons before anyone else can push them. Please try to be one step ahead of yourself at all times, Scorpio. And if you can't seem to resist your craving for the metaphorical equivalent of pickles and ice cream--and I'll be amazed if you can--be sure you balance it by cultivating a desire for ketchup and banana sandwiches.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You can't get what you want until you ask for what you want. That's always true, of course. But in the coming days, Sagittarius, it will be even more intensely true than usual. Your life will be a desolate wasteland of frustration if you expect everyone to telepathically guess what you're fantasizing about. But your life will be an overflowing cornucopia of delights if you state concisely, without any whining and without any attitude, precisely what it is you desire. Oh, by the way, here's a corollary to this week's Main Rule: You can't get what you want until you know what you want.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

With the help of a dead man, Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling achieved success in baseball's post-season playoffs. Shortly before his team's biggest games, Schilling suffered a serious ankle injury. His doctors dreamed up an experimental procedure that involved sewing his skin to the tissue beneath it, thereby creating a temporary barrier to prevent his weakened tendon from slipping. Since they'd never actually done it, they tried it out first on a cadaver. It worked, and they applied what they'd learned to help Schilling. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, Capricorn, you, too, will be blessed and aided by the dead in the coming weeks. It may not be as literal as in Schilling's case, but it could be equally dramatic.

No one knows you better than you do, Capricorn. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

There will be times in 2005 when I will ask you to spend quality time wrestling with people who disagree with you; I'll suggest that you expose yourself eagerly to influences that are unfamiliar and even alien. But don't do any of that in the coming weeks, Aquarius. Right now your assignments are to hang around like-minded people, to talk shop with cohorts who share your biases, and to build your community through fun and games. You need to feel you're part of a thriving web that supports you in your drive to live out your dreams--and you need to feel a lot of joy as you do it.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"If you want to build a ship," counseled author Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, "don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea." That's not only smart advice for a leader who wants to inspire the best in her team members, but also for anyone interested in motivating herself to risk great solo adventures. In fact, that's exactly what you should do in the coming weeks, Pisces. Whisper with wild abandon to your inner child, your inner explorer, your inner magician, and your inner monarch. Fill them with the desire to go in search of captivating mysteries that will thrill your heart.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'd love to see you risk making brilliant mistakes in the coming weeks, Aries. I hope you'll plunge into imaginative adventures without worrying about whether they'll have practical benefits. I look forward to cheering you on as you explore forbidden zones, dabble with unfamiliar pleasures, and try intriguing experiments that make you tingle all over. Now here's a tip, courtesy of Mark Twain, which should help you take maximum advantage of the mischievous opportunities ahead: "Always acknowledge a fault. This will throw those in authority off their guard and give you an opportunity to commit more."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Italian poet Dante Alighieri finished his masterpiece, The Divine Comedy, before he died. But when his sons, Jacopo and Pietro, assembled the manuscript for publication, they realized that parts of it were missing. They searched the house for days, to no avail. Only after they had given up hope did help arrive. The spirit of Dante appeared in Jacopo's dream and showed his son a hiding place in his old bedroom wall. Upon awakening, Jacopo went to the spot his father had pointed out and found the lost papers. I offer this story as a gift to you, Taurus. I believe that sometime in the next three weeks, you will have a comparable experience. What form might it take? Maybe the dead will assist you in locating a valuable. One of your dreams could provide a missing clue that will solve a mystery. It's conceivable you'll receive a legacy from a departed loved one. And maybe all of these possibilities will come to pass.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Last January, an Indiana man named Randy Fletcher came home from work early and found his wife in bed with another man. In March, after working for years to restore his 1956 Chevy to mint condition, he wrecked it on a country road when he swerved to avoid hitting a deer. The capper came in May, when his beloved dog fell ill and had to be euthanized. But on July 17, two days after his divorce was final, his luck changed: Fletcher won $1 million in the state lottery. Your recent hardships haven't been anywhere near as harsh as his, Gemini, nor will your imminent reward be as monumental. But I do expect that you will soon be compensated handsomely for your trouble.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

A poultry expert has come up with a revolutionary use for the feathers that are left over when chickens are slaughtered. David Emery has built a machine to turn the damp, dirty refuse into a strong, light fiber that's suitable for making auto parts and medical instruments. I believe you will possess a similar capacity for ingenious transformation in the coming weeks, Cancerian. Though your work may not always be fun or easy, you will be an alchemical wizard with the power to metamorphose muck and dregs into useful stuff.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"The pace of change is accelerating," says futurist Ray Kurzweil. "We're doubling the paradigm shift rate, the rate of progress, every decade." I agree with Kurzweil. By my estimate, half of what you know today will be obsolete in five years. Isn't that exciting? What could be more pleasurable than continually molting your old perspectives and growing fresh ways to see the world? That's the good news, Leo. Now here's the great news: The coming months will be an ideal time to formulate and jumpstart an aggressive five-year plan to keep your education continually up to date.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"To the mind that is still," said the ancient Chinese sage Lao Tzu, "the whole universe surrenders." This is true all the time, of course, but in the coming weeks it will be even more intensely true for you. According to traditional astrologers, that would be a problem. They believe that advising Virgos to keep their minds still is like ordering Niagara Falls to stop splashing 600,000 gallons of water per second over its precipice. But here's my nontraditional perspective: It may be harder for you Virgos to quiet your mind, but if and when you actually accomplish it, the universe surrenders more completely to you than to any other sign. (P.S. On March 29, 1848, an ice jam stopped the flow of water over Niagara Falls for several hours.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Hydrogen is an explosive, highly inflammable gas. Oxygen is an essential ingredient in sustaining any blaze. But when the two are mixed together in the right proportion, they form water, which is the opposite of fire. You should regard this as an apt metaphor for the opportunity you will have in the coming weeks, Libra. To get started in taking advantage of this promise, meditate on this question: What two fiery elements can you combine to bring a soothing, moistening influence into your life?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Materialism is our culture's dominant ideology. It's the specious doctrine that physical matter is the only reality and that nothing can be said to exist unless it's perceivable by our five senses or detected by instruments we've created.  Paradoxically, the proponents of materialism warn us to be skeptical about all phenomena that they don't recognize as real, even as they fanatically avoid skepticism about their own fundamentalist assumptions! I urge you to undertake an inquiry into the ways your outlook on the world has been hemmed in by this crippling superstition, Scorpio. Begin immediately. In 2005, you'll be offered abundant help from spiritual sources. If you're overly influenced by materialism, you'll have trouble recognizing and accessing those riches.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

According to my reading of the astrological omens, you have recently fulfilled the first part of the Dalai Lama's theory that "not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck." It may take a few weeks for the second part--the "wonderful stroke of luck" part--to fully take effect. But I bet you'll get a glimpse of its early stages in the coming week. Don't spend even ten seconds lost in regret about not getting what you want. Start uncorking your gratitude immediately.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)
Guitar World magazine says that Poison guitarist C.C. DeVille played the worst guitar solo of all time. Forbes put the Chevy Vega on its list of the worst cars ever made. Poet Bob Holman selected William Topaz McGonagall as the worst poet in history. Salon.com decided that a humorous passage in my memoir, The Televisionary Oracle,, deserved second place in its Bill O'Reilly Bad Sex Writing Contest. With these examples as your inspiration, Capricorn, I invite you to figure out what thing you're not so good at--maybe even so bad that you're the worst ever. Why? Because you're entering the Season of Humility, that's why. You should celebrate all the flaws and failures that prevent you from turning into an arrogant know-it-all. Besides, if you have fun mocking your own shortcomings, you might convince fate to kick your ass very gently during the imminent karmic adjustment.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

I don't know if you're interested--lots of seemingly more practical matters are soaking up your attention right now--but it's my duty to inform you that you can make more progress towards spiritual enlightenment in the next three weeks than you've made in the previous ten months. Alert, relaxed listening should be the radical act at the heart of your drive towards illumination. Ferocious curiosity should be your normal state of awareness. "Thou shalt be aggressively receptive" should be your main commandment.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

If you're average, you have more than 1,400 dreams a year. But there have been few weeks in 2004 when you've had as many vivid, memorable, and useful dreams as you're likely to enjoy in the coming days. Pay close attention, Pisces! No other sources--not psychics, psychotherapists, good books, or wise teachers--can provide you with as much useful information as your dreams will. They will be intimate, artful, playful communiqu√©s from your soul, designed to give you answers to critical questions that you are just beginning to formulate.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In 2001, a man was out walking his dog alongside the River Ivel in England when he stumbled upon an unexpected treasure: a 1,200-year-old gold coin bearing the image of King Coenwulf, who ruled the long-defunct kingdom of Mercia from 796-821. The coin was auctioned off three years later, earning its finder more than $200,000. I nominate this vignette as your Official Metaphor of the coming weeks, Aries. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you too will soon discover an old valuable that will ultimately bring you good fortune.

My Taurus friend Allie just put a new bumper sticker on her car: "I can't remember if I'm the good twin or the evil one." It's almost as if she intuitively guessed one of the key themes you Bulls will soon be wrestling with: how to tell the difference between your strong, beautiful, inspiring qualities and your unripe, unlovely, and debilitating ones. It won't be as easy as you might imagine. There are sides of your personality that are a blend of both the good and the bad, for one thing. It's also true that your virtues sometimes mutate into vices, and vice versa. Proceed on this exploratory mission with a tough but open mind.

"Anybody can become angry--that is easy," said Aristotle. "But to be angry with the right person, and to the right degree, and at the right time, and for the right purpose, and in the right way--that is not within everybody's power and is not easy." I agree with Aristotle. Those who are able to express anger with maximum integrity are as brilliant as any Nobel Prize winner and as saintly as Gandhi and Mother Teresa combined. Can you imagine yourself rising to that challenge, Gemini? Your assignment in the coming week is to try to master the art of constructive wrath.

In his new book, The Naked Woman (available thus far only in the U.K.), biologist Desmond Morris says that women have four G-spots. He calls the other three the A-Spot, C-Spot, and U-Spot. I thought you Cancerians should know about this fantastic news. You're in the thick of the Season of Bliss, when you should be expanding your capacity to give and experience all sorts of pleasure. I suggest that you do lots of hands-on research to expand your erotic possibilities. Don't stop there, though; explore the frontiers of feeling good in every way you can imagine.

"The golden opportunity you are seeking is in yourself," wrote motivational author Orison Swett Marden. "It is not in your environment; it is not in luck or chance, or the help of others; it is in yourself alone." Personally, I think that's a bit overstated. In my experience, divine grace in the form of unexpected assistance is usually involved when a golden opportunity shows up. On the other hand, most of us do underestimate how much power we have to make good things happen. This is the time and this is the place, Leo, to stop underestimating. Your will is stronger than you realize.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Time for a poetry break, Virgo. You've gotten way too serious and literal. Read the following advice with the right side of your brain, please. Imagine you have a guardian angel who resembles the celebrity you love most. Sing your favorite commercial jingle with reverence. Recall and relive the last day of your childhood. Drink the tears of someone you love. If you come upon a lamp with a genie in it, don't wish you had a magic wand. Speak aloud what the poet John Keats wrote: "I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of Imagination." Refer to yourself as the "Earth-Shaking, Record-Breaking, Love-Erecting, Truth-Correcting, Mind-Expanding, Justice-Demanding Bolt of Liquid Lightning."

In 2002, physicists at Middle Tennessee State University were able to transmit electric signals through coaxial cable at four times the speed of light, even though the equipment they used was cheap stuff from Radio Shack. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you now have the potential to pull off an almost equally amazing feat at a very low cost. So don't assume you need complicated, sophisticated resources this week, Libra. It'll be fine to rely on your personal equivalent of what the Tennessee scientists called "basement science."

According to philosopher George Santayana, "A fanatic is one who redoubles his effort when he has forgotten his aim." Let's make sure that doesn't become an apt description of you in the coming weeks, Scorpio. I have no problem with you redoubling your already-intensive efforts. In fact, I encourage you to take your dogged, concentrated approach to new levels that are unprecedented even for you. Just make sure that you never get sidetracked by fantasies of revenge or other irrelevant diversions. Stay hyper-focused on your worthy, noble goals. Show all of us the meaning of enlightened obsession.

Let's say, hypothetically speaking, that a crocodile had you trapped in its clenched jaws. The situation would be hopeless, right? No, not at all. If you had the presence of mind to jam your fingers into the beast's eyeballs, it would release you immediately. Similarly, Sagittarius, the predicament in which you actually find yourself these days is not as dire as you might imagine. Escape will be surprisingly easy if you simplify your perspective and let your instinct for survival guide you.

Why do human beings have no more genes than worms? Why do black sheep have a better sense of smell than white sheep? Why do more than four million Americans believe they've been kidnapped by extraterrestrials? Why do men have nipples? Why do Capricorns ask fewer questions than any other sign of the zodiac? I don't know the answer to any of those queries, but I do know that it's time for you to challenge the premise of that last one. Even if there's a grain of truth in the theory that you're not a gung-ho practitioner of the spirit of inquiry, that's got to change. For the next six weeks, you should be the most persistent and imaginative question-asker in all of creation.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Shamans and mystics down through the ages have insisted that the invisible universe is more vast and real than the visible one. In recent years, modern astronomers have adopted a similar perspective. According to the prestigious science journal Nature, the new consensus is that the cosmos is composed of 23 percent dark matter and 73 percent dark energy, which are utterly concealed from our five senses and undetectable by any known instruments. The stuff we can actually perceive-stars, planets, trees, clouds, buildings, chocolate candy, other people-is a mere four percent of everything there is. I bring this up, Aquarius, because it's an excellent time to cultivate your relationship with all that is unseen. Using your sixth sense, see if you can tune in to and fall more deeply in love with the Great Mystery.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I've assembled three experts to provide you with astrologically apt counsel for the coming week. First, here's writer Christopher Morley: "Read, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, every day, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be silly enough to do. It is bad for the mind to continually be part of unanimity." Here's your second advisor, German writer and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: "A person should hear music, read poetry, and see a fine picture every day of his life, in order that worldly cares may not obliterate the sense of the beautiful which God has implanted in the human soul." Finally, Pisces, here's a crucial tip from Oscar-winning actress, Katherine Hepburn: "If you obey all the rules, you miss all the fun."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Three Aries starlets have recently stopped dying their hair blonde. Mandy Moore, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Reese Witherspoon have all returned to their brunette roots, relieving themselves of the pressure to masquerade. I suggest you draw inspiration from their example. Stop all pretending. Throw off your disguises. Be as natural as you dare to be. Beginning November 22, "Know thyself," will be your battle cry, and the best way to prepare for that day is to make "Be thyself!" your mantra for now.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

On a song from his multi-platinum album, Get Rich or Die Trying, hip-hop artist 50 Cent sings,  "I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love." Your assignment, Taurus, is to do the opposite: Be into making love, not having sex. What? You say you already do that all the time? Well I'd like to suggest that like most of us, you still have a lot to learn about making love with your heart completely open and your mind full of innocent wonder. There's more you could do to bestow blessings and invoke the divine presence while in your intimate embraces. Are you brave and humble enough to go to the next level? (P.S. If you don't have a partner, work solo.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

For years, the walls of many public restrooms were inscribed with the graffiti, "A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle." Recently, my Gemini friend Ross made it his mission to spread a mutated version of that meme. He has personally decorated scores of bathroom walls with the saying, "A Gemini needs emotions like a fish needs a bicycle." He thinks your tribe can function just fine without the messy complications that emotions bring. I disagree. Though you certainly don't need to wallow in the swampy tumult that some people seem addicted to, you do periodically require the humanizing effect of deep, mysterious, overwhelming feelings. This is one of those times.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

If you're fully alive, the answer to the question, "What is the meaning of life?" keeps evolving. Last century's or last year's truth can't possibly be true for the person you are changing into. So what's the answer for you these days? Only you can decide, of course, but I'll offer a suggestion based on my astrological analysis. It's from philosopher Tom Morris. "The meaning of life," he says, "is creative love. Not love as an inner feeling, not as a private sentimental emotion, but love as a dynamic power moving out into the world and doing something original."

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Legendary underwater explorer Sylvia Earle was named a "Hero of the Planet" by Time magazine in recognition of her pioneering efforts to preserve marine sanctuaries. Because she holds so many diving records and has spent so many hours submerged in the ocean, she is known as "Her Deepness." You should consider making this practical idealist your role model in the coming weeks, Leo. Her adventures are perfect metaphors for the work you should pursue: bold excursions into the intriguing abyss; devoted cultivation of the beauty that lies below; and in-depth care for your life's submerged mysteries. (P.S. Do you mind if I refer to you as "Your Deepness"?)

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

If you'd like to be in harmony with cosmic rhythms, Virgo, spend quality time thinking about the future of your education. I'm not just referring to plans for school. You should ruminate about which people you'd like to learn from and how to hone your listening skills. You should take inventory of what subjects excite your curiosity and what training you'll need to fulfill your dreams.  I also urge you to freshen up your mind by emptying it of at least ten of your entrenched opinions. Now write this gem from William Butler Yeats on a piece of paper, and carry it with you till December 1: "Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire."

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Virgo. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)
The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's best-known novel, was not the author's first choice as a title. He wanted to call it Trimalchio in West Egg, but was overruled by an editor. Similarly, Gone with the Wind was originally Tomorrow Is Another Day. Valley of the Dolls was They Don't Build Statues to Businessmen. And my book The Televisionary Oracle was initially called A Feminist Man's Guide to Picking Up Women. I hope that hearing of these shifts inspires you to rename your own life story, Libra. The events of recent months have changed your long-term plot lines so much that you really do need a new title.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"A new idea is delicate," wrote author Charles Brower. "It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a joke or worried to death by a frown on the right person's brow." And that's exactly why you should be so protective of your fresh approaches and budding innovations this week, Scorpio. They may ultimately evolve into breathtaking brainstorms if they're given room to grow. Don't discuss them with anyone except sensitive people who respect you.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"This is what I believe," wrote D.H. Lawrence. "That my soul is a dark forest. That my known self will never be more than a little clearing in the forest. That gods come forth from the forest into the clearing of my known self, and then go back. That I must have the courage to let them come and go. That I will try always to recognize and submit to them." I'm hoping this passage inspires you in two ways, Sagittarius. First, you're in especially close touch with the deepest sources of your life, so it's an excellent time to write your own creed, beginning with the phrase "This is what I believe." Secondly, more gods than usual are coming forth into the clearing of your known self, and they're uncommonly willing to give you juicy clues. Pay close attention to their whispers and screams.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"True beauty doesn't reveal itself until the winds of time have had their say," says graphic designer Todd Dominey. "Beauty is in the cracks, the worn spots, and the imperfect lines." Your assignment, Capricorn, is to be on high alert for this phenomenon. In fact, I urge you to avoid being seduced by fresh shiny beauty. It would distract you from the more hard-to-find stuff-the worn, imperfect, cracked beauty that alone can feed your soul right now.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Conventional wisdom says the best problems are those that place us under duress. There's supposedly no gain without pain; stress allegedly helps us call on resources that have been previously dormant. I partly agree. But I also believe that pain frequently generates no gain. We can easily get addicted to mediocre problems that drag on and on without rousing our sleeping genius. There is, furthermore, another class of problem-let's call it the delightful dilemma--that neither feeds on nor generates angst. On the contrary, the delightful dilemma is fun and invigorating, and blooms when we're feeling at home in the world. Imagine a life for yourself, Aquarius, in which the majority of your quandaries match this profile. Try out the theory that your most useful problems come when joy is your predominant state of mind.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Leo Alard was the first Hispanic to become an Episcopalian bishop in the U.S. His pioneer spirit emerged early on. As a young priest in the 1960s, he headed a racially integrated parish in Cattahoochee, Florida. The bigots of the KKK didn't look favorably on his work, and on one occasion they burned a cross on the church lawn. Alard, who was supervising a youth group on that particular night, brought the class out and had everyone toast marshmallows over the fire. I urge you to regard Alard as your hero in the coming week, Pisces, and imitate his genius. Capitalize fiercely on every apparent setback, making full use of playful humor and resourceful unpredictability.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When I advise you to spend the Halloween season awakening and nurturing your wildness, I'm referring to the definition of that word offered by Robert Bly in his book, The Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart. To be wild is not to be crazy like a criminal or psychotic, but "mad as the mist and snow." It has nothing to do with being childish or primitive, nor does it manifest as manic rebellion or self-damaging alienation. The marks of wildness, Bly says, are a love of nature, a delight in silence, a voice free to say spontaneous things, and an exuberant curiosity in the face of the unknown. Follow these leads, Aries, and expand on their meaning. Halloween costume suggestions: whirling dervish, ecstatic saint, Green Man, Artemis, Pan, trickster crone.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In his book How's Your AQ Today?, ex-business executive Ed Rychkun says that our culture is so twisted that most bosses and leaders are jerks. In fact, it's often necessary "to be an asshole in order to succeed." (The "AQ" in his title stands for "Asshole Quotient.") I doubt that you're an arrogant tyrant, insensitive egotist, or deceitful bully, Taurus, so I can't imagine that you have a high AQ. That may also mean you've never been in a position to manipulate and exploit lots of people. According to my reading of the astrological omens, however, you need to temporarily experience what corrupt power is like. It will fill a gap in your education. That's why I suggest you disguise yourself as a domineering, hyper-ambitious honcho this Halloween.

No one knows you better than you do, Taurus. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Most of us lie regularly. Studies say the average person unleashes three fictions per day. Our deceits are often harmless, designed to avoid hurting someone's feelings or to spare ourselves from inconvenience. Still, the habit is so unconscious it puts us in peril of falsifying more important matters. Your task in the coming week, Gemini, is to investigate your tendency to distort the truth. The masquerade season presents you with an opportunity to do this in a radically fun way: through parody and exaggeration. For your Halloween persona, you could be "The Big Liar." At parties, tell nonstop whoppers. Wear white clothes on which you've written fibs  like "I am President of Madagascar," "Eating ice cream and potato chips prevents cancer," and "Luxembourg is hiding weapons of mass destruction."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Real estate developer and TV star Donald Trump filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. He was seeking to get a legal death grip on his signature phrase, "You're fired!" That inspired me to try to get a trademark for one of my favorite declarations, "You're a genius!" I haven't had a good excuse to direct that praise your way any time recently, Cancerian, but in the coming weeks you'll be the sign most deserving of it. You are now at the height of your originality; you're as close as you've ever been to discovering your special mission here on earth. For Halloween, consider dressing up as a famous prodigy, including any of the following: Mozart, Leonardo da Vinci, Stephen Hawking, Nobel Prize-winning chemist Marie Curie, Jane Goodall, Georgia O'Keeffe, or hip-hop artist Missy Elliott.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"In the very earliest time," wrote the Inuit shamaness and poet, Nalungiaq, "people and animals spoke the same language." Your Halloween assignment, Leo, is to find within you the atavistic remnant of that magic. Imagine yourself as an animal that speaks. Visualize yourself as a human who growls or brays or warbles. Picture yourself as a creature who can easily shift back and forth between the two parts of you, the animal that talks and the human who crows and bellows and purrs. Costume suggestion: panther-witch, eagle-clown, crocodile-executive, dragonfly-doctor, bear-rock star.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Nothing could give you more power over your fears than a Halloween devoted to impersonating your fears. That's why I suggest you get yourself a costume that will let you pretend to be what you're most afraid of. If a nuclear explosion is your greatest bugaboo, dress up as a mushroom cloud. If your boss is the source of your most primal dread, become him or her for a couple of days. If you're terrified of being exposed as a fraud or descending into poverty or losing your good looks, dive into the heart of that scary experience.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

No provocative poetry this week, Libra. No sublime philosophy or soulful psychology. Just the facts, ma'am or sir. It's time to get down to earth and back to basics; time to cut the crap and prune the weeds. So try this no-nonsense straight-talk on for size: Don't negotiate when you're exhausted. Tolerate a temporary hassle if you're sure it will lead to a permanent upgrade. Be a creator rather than a spectator. Sell yourself first, then your product. Don't vote for smiling monsters who play on your fears. For Halloween, dress up as a hundred-dollar bill or a hammer and a nail or a book called, How to Be Real.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

To be silent when it's time to speak is a weakness, says a Persian proverb. I say it's also a bad idea to speak when it's time to be silent. In the coming week, one of these rules or the other will always be in effect for you, Scorpio. To know which one is in ascendancy at any given time, you'll have to be very alert; conditions will be shifting constantly. Make it your goal to be so attuned to the fresh truth of each new moment that you will always express yourself when the time is ripe, and shut up when it isn't. Halloween costume suggestions: a pythoness or fortune-teller; a talking mime or a silent clown who carries around chalk and a portable chalkboard to communicate; Triumph the Insult Comic Dog with a muzzle.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In 1204, Roman Catholic Crusaders destroyed Constantinople because it was the spiritual center of the Orthodox Christian Church, which had broken away from Vatican rule. Almost 800 years later, Pope John Paul II formally apologized to the Orthodox leader, Bartholomew I. It took a while, but Bartholomew finally accepted the apology in 2004. In the coming week, Sagittarius, I urge you to be inspired by their actions as you carry out an orgy of atonement.  Extend forgiveness even to those who hurt you long ago, and ask for forgiveness even from those you hurt long ago. Halloween costume suggestion: religious penitent or self-flagellant.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Lessons becoming available to you in the near future will offer more long-range benefits than you can imagine. If you take them to heart, they could influence you to make changes that will ultimately allow you to live past the age of 100. They might also help you bring your ten-year and twenty-year master plans into sharper focus. Added bonus: Your priorities concerning love will receive a spiritual version of a chiropractic adjustment. Halloween costume suggestion: an eager, curious student who carries books and takes notes everywhere you go.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

The omurasaki butterfly is native to East Asia. Though beautiful and graceful, it's unusually big and strong. In territorial battles over who gets the right to suck the sap of the kunugi and konara trees, it beats out all of its butterfly competitors, and is even known to chase away birds that try to horn in on its sweet treat. I suggest that you dress up as the big, purple-winged omurasaki this Halloween. It will symbolize your soul's growing ability to be elegant yet tough-to be a gliding and lyrical yet willful force of nature.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I predict that in the next 11 months you will be wanted, needed, desired, and adored more than you ever have before. You may also be mistrusted and doubted more frequently as well. To put yourself in a frame of mind that will prepare you for this state, I suggest you choose from the following disguises for your Halloween revels: a gorgeous femme fatale, a generous billionaire, or a barrel of oil.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I have a good imagination, but it's difficult for me to wrap my mind around the possibility that anyone besides a white Christian fundamentalist millionaire is planning to vote for George W. Bush in the upcoming election. The man is not only a menace to the environment, women's rights, healthcare, the economy, science, and the English language, but is also fighting terrorism in all the wrong ways. Still, I refuse to detest him. On the contrary, I send him my blessings. Likewise, though I'm pained by readers who enjoy my horoscopes yet support Bush, I love them just the same. It's very important for you to apply my approach in the coming weeks, Aries. Do not, under any circumstances, revile the people you disagree with. Keep in mind Booker T. Washington's view:  "I shall allow no man to belittle my soul by making me hate him."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"When one door closes, another door opens." That old saying is only a half-truth, and what it leaves out is crucial. Here's a more complete version: When one door closes, another door opens, but where the new door opens might not be immediately obvious; you may have to be energetic, persistent, and even ingenious to find it. Keep this uppermost in your mind during the next three weeks, Taurus.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

As the most powerful nation prepares to choose the world's most powerful leader, we all have a stake in the proceedings. Whether or not you're an American, the candidate who wins the presidential election will deeply affect your personal future. In my estimation, John Kerry is far more likely to have a benevolent impact, George W. Bush a negative one. I've arrived at this conclusion by carefully paring away my emotional biases and taking an objective look at long-term planetary omens. In my capacity as your astrological advisor, then, I urge you to visualize Kerry being inaugurated as president next January. Now here's your homework: Meditate on Pericles' assertion that "Just because you don't take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you."

No one knows you better than you do, Gemini. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Astrology divides human personalities into twelve basic types named after the zodiacal signs. In her books, Agapi Stassinopoulos proposes an alternative system based on 15 Greek gods and goddesses. Using her approach, I've determined that you are currently a blend of Aphrodite and Artemis. Aphrodite embodies love, beauty, and passion, and her essence is summed up by the statement, "It is what I am, not what I do, that is valuable about me." Artemis, on the other hand, is independent and strong; her message is "Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid." How is it possible to be a synthesis of these two? You tell me, Cancerian. It'll be your specialty in the coming weeks.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Here's good news for Leo actor Billy Bob Thornton: The coming weeks will be a perfect time to conquer his phobias of antique furniture, Komodo dragons, intestinal parasites, old silver forks, and photos of Benjamin Disraeli's hair. For that matter, all of you Leos will experience a dramatic increase in your power to conquer irrational anxieties and superstitious fantasies. Stand up to your inner bully! Don't let that intimidating fear-monger push you around any more.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"The greatest menace to civilization," wrote historian Herbert Butterfield, "is the conflict between giant organized systems of self-righteousness--each system only too delighted to find that the other is wicked--each only too glad that the sins give it the pretext for still deeper hatred and animosity." Are you a part of one of those giant organized systems of self-righteousness, Virgo? Do you subscribe even a little to their simplistic, toxic philosophies? If so, I beg you to banish their influence from your life. Dropping out of the great "us versus them" racket is one of the single most important acts you can take to heal your own psyche and guarantee your future success.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

What seemingly unconnected elements of your life are actually ripe to be combined? Your past and your future?  Romance and education? Your drive for fairness and your love of beauty? I'm telling you, Libra, there are fragments of your world that have more in common than you've previously imagined, and should therefore be woven together. Your sensuality and spirituality? Your relationship with money and the power of your imagination? Your listening skills and your longing to be more appreciated?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"I can't understand why people are frightened of new ideas," said composer John Cage. "I'm frightened of the old ones." That thought should be your guiding principle in the coming weeks, Scorpio. No matter how useful your elegant theories have always been, they're now becoming barriers to your progress. No matter how attached you are to the insights and opinions that have made you what you are today, you should be willing to outgrow them. "In a time of drastic change," wrote Eric Hoffer, "it's the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists."

Yellow jacket wasps have never been known to journey north of the Arctic Circle. They prefer warmer climates. But recently they began buzzing around a village in the northern part of Baffin Island, surprising the local residents, who have no word for the insects in their native Inuktitut language. I predict there'll soon be a comparable event in your life, Sagittarius. You will need new terms as well as fresh concepts to understand the appearance of an unprecedented phenomenon.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The coming week will be filled with opportunities to improve your skills at diplomacy. You'll get a lot of practice playing verbal games, talking in code, and being artfully ambiguous. For best results, don't take yourself too seriously. Let your imagination run half-wild-and maybe even risk crossing that fine line between creative storytelling and BS.

One of the tabloids revealed that Ronald Reagan's ghost has been doing scores of good deeds since he died. For example, when a surgeon in a hospital accidentally dropped his ring in his patient's abdominal incision, the ex-president's spirit fished it out. On another occasion, the friendly ghost saved an old woman from a rabid raccoon during her walk in the woods. What the tabloid didn't report is that Reagan also visited me. As I was working on your horoscope, he materialized as a misty grey blob. "Need any assistance?" he croaked. "Sure," I said. "But I've got to be honest-I always opposed your politics and I never voted for you." "Want to know a secret?" he chuckled in reply. "In the afterlife, I've turned into a bleeding heart liberal. All I do is help people." "OK," I said, "then how about giving me some tips for the horoscope I'm writing for Aquarians?" "Sure," Reagan beamed. "Tell 'em to go hunting for a new power spot. Build up their clout. Act more authoritative. Spread their influence with more confidence. But do it all with love, not ego."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

For the long-term well-being of planet Earth, nothing is more important than electing a new American president. I'd prefer to vote for the Green Party candidate, David Cobb, because his principles are more aligned with mine than John Kerry's. And when I go to cast my ballot near closing time on November 2, I will opt for Cobb if exit polls show Kerry is comfortably ahead of Bush in my home state of California. But if the race is still too close to call, I'll definitely choose Kerry. I suggest you regard my plan as a model for how to approach your entire life in the coming weeks, Pisces: Find a way to serve the greatest good for everyone in your life while at the same time following your heart. But if you can't do both, serve the greatest good.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The guy in front of me in the grocery store checkout line today was wearing a t-shirt that said, "Sublimely tacky, yet refreshingly unrefined." That's a perfect lead-in to the astrological advice I'd like to convey to you this week, which is: You're most likely to be happy and successful if you stop trying to deny the fact that you're a beautifully messy mass of contradictions. It's high time for you to celebrate your inconsistencies and regard your mutability as a strength. I encourage you to invite all of your different sub-personalities to a big come-as-you-are party in your head.

Do you remember when you learned to read, back when you were six years old? One week the clumps of letters were indecipherable, and the next week you could actually make sense of them. I propose to you, Taurus, that you are now at a comparable threshold in the evolution of your emotional life. Feelings that have previously been obscure or puzzling will soon come into focus. You'll be blessed with an upgrade in your intuition about your friends' and loved ones' moods. Your power to enjoy intimacy will dramatically ripen.

Speaking to an audience at Harvard University, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia made the observation that "sexual orgies eliminate social tensions and ought to be encouraged." While I do approve of you spending the next week exploring the frontiers of sensual pleasure, I'm not sure you should go as far as Scalia suggests. Or if you do, make sure you really like and respect your fellow orgiasts. Your erotic adventures should never erode but should always support your spiritual values.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

A million jobs have been lost since our fellow Cancerian, George W. Bush, became U.S. president. The nation's dangerously high budget deficit, now at record levels, is due to his spending hikes and tax cuts for the wealthy. He instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to go ahead and approve new pesticides without bothering to find out if they'd threaten endangered species. He ignored 49 retired generals and admirals when they asked him to take billions of dollars earmarked for his quixotic missile defense shield and instead use the funds to protect potential terrorist targets like ports and nuclear facilities. Despite these and many other extremist actions, millions of Americans still plan to vote for him on November 2. While other Crabs like you and I won't have THAT much slack in coming weeks, we will get quite a lot. It may be time for us to try getting away with bold moves we haven't dared before.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In the film, Angels in America, the character named Belize describes his vision of heaven. It's not a spotlessly clean gated community where everyone wears white gowns and nothing ever changes. Rather, it's a "big city, overgrown with weeds, but flowering weeds. On every corner a wrecking crew, and something new and crooked going up catty-cornered to that. Gusts of gritty wind, and a gray, high sky alive with ravens. Piles of trash, but lapidary like rubies and obsidian. Diamond-colored streamers. Voting booths. Dance palaces full of music and lights and racial impurity and gender confusion. All the deities are creole, mulatto, brown as the mouths of rivers." While that's not necessarily how I envision my ideal home, I love its implication that we should imagine paradise to be mysterious, intriguing, and in flux. Let Belize inspire you to be soulful and poetic, Leo, as you update your own vision of perfection-your conception of the good life.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The astrological omens are pretty odd right now. They seem to be suggesting that your luck will be good and you'll be in maximum alignment with the cosmic rhythms if you watch a lot of daytime TV, eat heaps of junk food, get no more than four hours of sleep a night, and argue with yourself loudly in public. Just kidding, Virgo. I was merely testing to see whether you've become overly gullible towards so-called authorities like me. The truth is that you should free yourself from influences that presume to tell you what to do. Get their voices completely out of your head so you can clearly	 hear the still, small voice of your fiercely tender intuition.

"Each of us has a name given by God and given by our parents," writes the Israeli poet Zelda Mishkovsky. "Each of us has a name given by our sins and by our longing. Each of us has a name given by our enemies and by our love. Each of us has a name given by our celebrations and by our work. Each of us has a name given by the sea and by the stars." Your homework for the coming week, Libra, is to figure out all ten names that Mishkovsky says you have. Your identity is ripe for expansion; your sense of self is ready to bloom.

Your recent "experiment" reminds me of the Malaysian performance artist who locked herself in a glass box with 2,700 scorpions, hoping to remain there for 30 days. After being stung by the poisonous arachnids seven times, she almost left early. Ultimately, though, she toughed it out. I figure you are at a point in your own adventure where you've managed to survive the equivalent of five stings, Scorpio. But in my opinion you've already proved your point. I suggest you finish the "experiment" immediately.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Events in the coming week will bring the beginning of the end of an influence you love to hate. They will also usher in a turning point for your relationship with a person you should treat better than you do. And that's just a fraction of the many adventures headed your way, Sagittarius. Finales and climaxes will be in the works everywhere you turn, and you will get one last chance to fix a long-standing mess before it explodes. Is that dramatic enough for you? No? You want even more? OK, then, how's this: You may finally realize what you want to be when you grow up.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Sagittarius. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

I myself was born under the astrological sign of Cancer the Crab, but I've worked long and hard to make sure I love all the other signs equally. Similarly, I don't belong to any political party, but I treat Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, and Greens with respect. And though I'll be voting for John Kerry in the presidential election, that doesn't mean I despise those who support George W. Bush. Your assignment this week, Capricorn, is to follow my example as you deal with the hot-button issues of your personal life. Be true to your ideals, but keep your heart and mind open to those who don't share your fervent passions.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

To begin the 19th season of her TV talk show, Oprah Winfrey gave away a brand new $28,000 car to everyone in her studio audience. Inspired by her example, I've decided to bestow an incredibly valuable boon on you: three love spells. The first will banish any resentments or hatreds that you harbor against old lovers. The second will boost your skill at seeing others for who they really are. And my third love spell will help you concentrate as much on giving love as on getting it.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Cosmic omens can be interpreted on many levels. This week, for instance, some astrologers might credibly suggest that you Pisceans should work behind the scenes to gently coax people into serving your secret agendas. Other astrologers might urge you to go undercover to gather hard-to-access information that will help you build up your power. Yet other stargazers might predict you're in line for some consciousness-altering adventures, and encourage you to seek out their most positive expression. I go along with all of those possibilities, but add my own spin: It's a perfect time for you to carry out a rite of passage for yourself, complete with awe-inspiring ceremonies and reverent communion with divine allies.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When actress Mia Farrow was still a teenager, 59-year-old painter Salvador Dali asked her to dinner. As an appetizer, he served her butterfly wings on crackers. "They had almost no taste at all," Farrow told Gregg LaGambina in Filter. But she was nevertheless thrilled by the artfulness of the gesture. I expect you'll encounter a similar phenomenon in the coming week, Aries: an exotic treat that'll be rich in symbolism, though not particularly substantial. And that might be just what you need most.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

J. Edgar Hoover headed the FBI for almost 50 years. While many admired the way he transformed it from an amateurish collection of hacks into a formidable law enforcement agency, others regarded him as a paranoid control freak who gave police work a bad name. Even U.S. President Lyndon Johnson had a strong ambivalence towards the man. Asked by The New York Times why he didn't fire Hoover, Johnson replied, "It's probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in." Consider making that your motto in the coming week, Taurus. There may be persons in your life who will serve you better as problematic friends than unpredictable adversaries.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Your passions renew you. They link you to the primal life force that some people call God and others refer to as kundalini. But when you get consumed in the numbing rhythms of the daily grind, you sometimes lose touch with your passions. I think that's dangerous. So how can you stay connected? That's exactly what you should be thinking about most in the coming weeks, Gemini. Here are a few suggestions to get you started: Pay close attention to every little thing that captivates your imagination. Be a connoisseur of the magic moments that light you up. Become an expert in knowing what excites you.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

A character you could justifiably call "Swamp Angel" will help you get down and dirty this week-and I mean "down and dirty" in the best sense. You're deep by nature, Cancerian, but you may have never been as deep as you're going to get in the next few weeks. Swamp Angel will be just one of several influences urging you to dive beyond your previous levels. By the way, I suspect that while you're exploring the depths, you'll encounter some paradoxical pleasures that aren't what they initially appear to be. To assist you in preparing for them, I'll tell you what I heard a little boy tell his father in a grocery store today: "I'm a monster, but I'm a good monster."

Leo (July 23-August 22)

We live in the Milky Way Galaxy, which is shaped like a pinwheel. Recently, astronomers were shocked and embarrassed when they realized that the pinwheel has a fifth arm, one more than they've always believed. It's not as if this extra appendage has been hard to spot: It's 77,000 light years long! "I was absolutely flabbergasted," astronomer Tom Dames told NewScientist.com. "The fifth arm was quite clearly seen in previous surveys but was never pointed out or given a name." I expect that a comparable discovery is about to unfold in your personal life, Leo. An important clue to your destiny--an open secret that has been "hiding" in plain view--will finally register on your awareness.

No one knows you better than you do, Leo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The British are not renowned for their fine cuisine. In any ranking of the world's culinary traditions, theirs would be near the bottom. And yet the Brits are responsible for having created and propagated the Western world's single most popular food, the sandwich. In a comparable way, Virgo, I predict that you will soon succeed in an area where you have little credibility or status. Either that, or you will produce some anomalously great thing that you supposedly have no talent for.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Those who say spirituality has nothing to do with politics," declared Gandhi, "do not know what spirituality really means." What do you think he was driving at, Libra? I'll tell you what I think. Since he used the term "spirituality," not "religion," I surmise that he wasn't referring to belief systems like Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, or Islam. Rather, he was talking about being guided by love, seeking the highest good for as many people as possible, and opening one's heart to the interconnectedness of everything. That was the influence he wished to bring to politics. Your challenge in the coming weeks, should you choose to accept it, is this: Give your political opinions a makeover by infusing them with spirituality.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Libra. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

This is a perfect time to brag about what you can't do and don't have. Why? Think of it as a way to neutralize any unsavory karma you may have accrued during outbreaks of excessive pride or hurtful arrogance in the past. As an example of how to proceed, I offer you the case of pop singer Enrique Iglesias. When asked by The Sun, a British newspaper, if he would consider being photographed nude for the cover of his future album, he said no. "I could actually have the smallest penis in the world," he explained. With that as your inspiration, Scorpio, get out there and start boasting in reverse.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Wrap your imagination around this innovation, if you can: a gas-electric hybrid SUV that's a luxury car but gets more than 40 miles per gallon and produces almost no smog-forming emissions. Lexus has created this marvel, and it'll go on sale in early 2005. I'm certainly not suggesting you should buy it, but I do think it's an apt symbol for the frame of mind you should cultivate in the coming weeks: lavish yet efficient; high-quality and responsible; richly expansive but smartly disciplined.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

According to "Harper's Index," many Americans believe that "politics and government are too complicated to understand." In fact, the average citizen thinks about politics just nine minutes a day. In my astrological opinion, Capricorn, your life should belie those statistics in the coming weeks. The future of your personal happiness will grow brighter if you deepen your understanding of the way government works. You will reap unexpected blessings from trying to affect the political process, whether it's on the local or national level. And what if you're not an American? My advice is the same. You may not have as much compensatory work to do as we Americans, but you will still benefit from intensifying your awareness of how your government impacts your destiny.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

The seventeenth-century Pilgrims were religious dissidents at odds with the Church of England. Persecuted for their beliefs, some set sail for the New World in the Mayflower, seeking a sanctuary to practice their spiritual principles in peace. They sighted land after 66 days. A few of them wanted to cruise south along the coast to Virginia, where the English Crown had promised them a grant of land. But the majority overruled them in order to address the most pressing problem: They had run out of beer. And that's why the Pilgrims ended up settling on the first place they saw, the cold, rocky shore of what's now Massachusetts. Upon landing, they immediately built a brewery. This vignette is an apt metaphor for your near future, Aquarius. You, too, will be driven by idealism to seek a haven where you can more purely be yourself, but you will ultimately respond to pragmatic concerns as well.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

One of the poets who performed at the poetry slam I just saw described how she used a needle and thread to sew up the wound from her suicide attempt. It seems that a few minutes after she slashed her wrist, she changed her mind and decided she wanted to live. I don't foresee anything nearly as melodramatic happening in your life, Pisces, but I do worry about you sabotaging yourself and then regretting it. Now that you know you're susceptible to making that error, however, I hope you'll forestall it altogether. Love yourself wildly and take care of yourself fiercely in the coming days.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

We have all been guilty of desiring people and things that turned out to be no good for us. Whenever I review the history of my own relationship with longing, I'm embarrassed about some of the dumb "pleasures" I once craved. I've also noticed, though, that sometimes the only cure for wanting ill-advised thrills is to actually get them. The suffering that ensues can be an excellent prod to avoid repeating the same mistake in the future. I bring this up, Aries, because it'll be important for you to keep in mind during the next six weeks. You will have to be quite discriminating about your desires. If you're careful, you can refrain from fulfilling the wrong ones.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In the French village of Lourdes is a spring whose waters are reputed to have miraculous powers of healing. For 150 years, sick and despondent pilgrims from all over the world have traveled there seeking relief. To get to the sacred sanctuary, ironically, seekers must make their way through streets filled with cheesy souvenir shops and tourist traps. And the restaurants in Lourdes are among the worst in all of France. This scenario may be a bit like your life in the coming days, Taurus. In your search for healing and purity, you'll probably have to weave your way through a mini-wasteland.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

This is Walk Your Talk Week for you Geminis. More than any other time this year, you will have everything going for you when you concentrate on translating your highest ideals into practical actions. Live up to your hype, you beautiful dreamer. Fulfill your promises. Call on all your ingenuity to create effects that are in harmony with your intentions. You are now capable of being as free of hypocrisy as it's possible for a human being to be.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

These days it's rare to hear music that's not channeled through machines. When is the last time you enjoyed beautiful singing unenhanced by a microphone or the technology of a recording studio? But I say unto you, my dear Cancerian, that it's now crucial for you to listen to the naked human voice raised in song. Don't stop there, either. Your soul craves all kinds of raw, unfiltered contact with the world-first-hand information that hasn't been translated or interpreted before it reaches you. So try divesting yourself of the opinions you've borrowed from "experts." Look for guidance from the experiences you actually have, not from stories, gossip, and news gleaned from second-hand sources. Make love with a real person, not with the fantasies implanted in your imagination by the entertainment industry.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

During the day, the sky is filled with as many stars as it is at night, but the sun so thoroughly monopolizes our attention that we can't see them. I believe this is an apt metaphor for a certain situation in your personal life, Leo. Some dominant force keeps you from becoming aware of less spectacular but still important influences. Soon, though, that dominant force will go on sabbatical. You'll be able to gaze upon sights that its presence normally obscures. Your understanding of the world will naturally change forever, and though that may be shocking at first, in the long run it will be invigorating.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"In countries where large percentages of the population believe in hell, there seems to be less corruption and a higher standard of living," concluded a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. My translation: Many people are motivated to do the right thing out of primal dread. I bring this up, Virgo, because it is critical for you to wean yourself of any attraction you might have to letting fear serve as a central motivator. I'm happy to report that in the coming months, you will have an unprecedented opportunity to retrain yourself to do just that. By September 2005, your quest for success and goodness could very well be inspired primarily by your love of life.

No one knows you better than you do, Virgo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

The cosmos is finally ready to discharge you from your heavy, dark assignments. Your main duty in the coming weeks is to seek relief and release in the most constructive ways possible. Celebrate, Libra, don't thrash. Rejoice and look to the future, don't thunder against the ordeal you've completed. I nominate the exuberant Libran poet Michael McClure to be your role model during this time. The poet Aaron Shurin has described McClure as a reveler who "puts the attitude in beatitude," and as an alchemist who's "fluent in two languages, English and Beast." That's exactly what you should be like as you lift your own spirits. Now please read aloud this paraphrase of a McClure poem: "GRAHHRR! RAHHR! RAHRIRAHHR! HRAHR! I'm not sugar, I'm love looking for sugar!"

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

What's dying within you, Scorpio? Is it a passion that has expired? A dream that has gone to seed? A goal you neglected for so long that it can't be resuscitated? If it's time for that part of you to die, help it die. I mean create a ritual in which you formally complete your relationship with it, let go of it for good, and begin the grieving process. In honor of its passing, write a testimonial or draw a symbolic picture, then bury that remembrance in the earth near a tree you love. When you're done with the funeral, eat the freshest, juiciest pear you can find.

"If you plant a crocus bulb, it won't grow into a grapevine," my teacher Ann Davies used to say. "You can't learn to play the violin by practicing the piano." I hope you've had some version of this wisdom lighting up the back of your mind these past 11 months, Sagittarius. Soon you will harvest the fruits of the seeds you planted around your last birthday, and you will leap to a new level of mastery in whatever skill or trick or habit you've been faithfully plying for the past 11 months.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In portentous tones, as if exposing yet another sickening deterioration of our collective health, the Centers for Disease Control recently informed us that the average person is "sad, blue, or depressed" about three days a month. As I read various news articles reporting the results of the CDC's survey, I looked in vain for even a glimmer of triumphant glee. After all, if we're downhearted three days every month, it means we're feeling pretty good the other 27 or 28 days. And that's a glorious revelation that should, in my opinion, provoke dancing in the streets. But now I have even better news for you, Capricorn: According to my reading of the astrological omens, you will have, at the most, just one day of feeling sad, blue, or depressed this October.

Mystery writer Agatha Christie took issue with the old saw that says "necessity is the mother of invention." Just as often, she believed, the creation of new conveniences is prompted by the desire to save time and trouble. If necessity is the mother of invention, laziness is the father. I suggest you make that your motto in the coming week, Aquarius. Be on the lookout for innovations that will free up your time and imagination. Dream and scheme about how you can get more room in your schedule to do absolutely nothing but dream and scheme.

In the autumn, the sweet gum tree in my yard is a paradoxical sight. As its green leaves turn red and fall to the ground, it seems to be announcing that it's slipping into a state of dormancy. At the same time, though, it sprouts hundreds of spiky, bright green balls full of seeds, as if to declare it's bursting with irrepressible vitality. This phase of the sweet gum's life is similar to where you are in your cycle right now, Pisces. Would you mind if I called you Sweet Gum?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In an effort to make a splash in America's upcoming presidential election, marginal candidate Ralph Nader has resorted to unusual measures. Among the most extreme has been his decision to accept money and help from the Republican Party, even though he opposes every value that organization holds dear. In the state of Michigan, for example, Nader wouldn't have gotten on the ballot without the heroic assistance of the Republicans, who collected 43,000 signatures for him in the hope that he'll drain votes from the Democratic nominee, John Kerry. I predict that you Aries people will have equally Machiavellian opportunities in the coming weeks. You may even be tempted to turn to your adversaries to further your dreams. Can you manipulate them to serve you more than they manipulate you to serve them?

Your superstitious fears may nag you more than usual in the coming weeks. That's the bad news. The good news is that it's highly unlikely the feared events will actually come to pass. To help dispel your unnecessary worries, I suggest you dream up and carry out a banishing ritual. For example, you could write down what you're afraid of, and then burn the piece of paper in the flame of a red candle as you cackle and chant, "You have no [insert an energizing taboo word here] power over me!"

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"I'm not afraid of snakes or spiders," says Gemini actress Nicole Kidman, "just butterflies." According to my astrological analysis, that could be an apt motto for many of you Geminis in the coming weeks. You'll probably love your playful wrestles with serpent-like people and enjoy your shadow dances with web-weavers. You'll thrive in the wake of intense emotions and enigmatic twists of fate. On the other hand, you'll be in danger of losing your focus during airy encounters with delicate creatures; you'll have to be vigilant to avoid getting thrown off course by pretty ephemera and lightweight pleasures.

One of the best-selling books in France in recent months has been Bonjour Paresse, or "Hello Laziness." The author, Corinne Maier, encourages employees to perfect the art of goofing off on the job. In the coming week, Cancerian, you should follow her advice not only at work but in every area of your life. I admire you for being so conscientious and putting so much effort into everything you do, but you're way overdue for some major slacking off. I'll go so far as to say that you have a spiritual need to vegetate. This is one time when you'll get my blessing if you decide to sit in a comfortable chair and daydream of nothing in particular as you watch the wind blow.

The Guinness Book of World Records says the shortest river in the world is the Roe River in Montana. Measuring about 220 feet long, it flows into the Missouri River, America's second-longest river. The Roe River's source is the Great Springs, which is the largest fresh water spring in the U.S. It's 3,000 years old, stays a constant 54 degrees, and pours out 200 million gallons of water per day. I'd like you to picture this entire scene in your mind's eye, Leo-the Roe River, the Missouri River, and the Great Springs. It provides a symbolic template for what your approach should be in the coming weeks. You should be a short and concise connecting link between an underground source of abundant vitality and a free-flowing force of nature that reminds you of a mighty river.

"I am one of those who never knows the direction of my journey until I have almost arrived," wrote author Anna Louise Strong. Right about now, Virgo, you could probably speak those same words with sincerity. For months you've felt as if an invisible force were shepherding you towards an unseen goal. You've trusted the process because it resonated with a gut feeling that kept telling you "YES!" And now, finally, you're about to come to the end of the quest and collect your reward. Keep in mind, though, that even after you have it, you may not fully understand it for months.

During last year's monsoon season in Sri Lanka, floods caused landslides in and around Ratnapura, the "City of Gems." As devastating as this natural disaster was, it dredged up many raw gems from their hiding places deep in the earth. After the heavy rains stopped, sapphires and rubies were strewn across the landscape for any passer-by to pick up. I foresee an analogous sequence operating in your life, Libra. The deluge will expose valuable beauty, making it easy to pluck.

"If you stick your finger in the fire," asked my teacher Ann Davies, "do you then complain that it is unfair when your finger gets burned? Do you call the fire bad?" I think her questions are essential for you to keep in mind between now and your birthday, Scorpio. If you consciously decide there are good, even honorable reasons for you to play with fire, go right ahead and do so. But if there's a bit of hell to pay as a result, don't you dare get pissed at the universe or diss God. And please don't say the fire is evil.

With the authority vested in me by the cosmic powers-that-be, I hereby authorize you to shower yourself with an equivalent barrage of blessings for all the hard work you've done during the last ten months. And please don't be shy about imitating the example of the PG&E; chiefs: Reward yourself handsomely even if you've accomplished little more than saving your own ass.

"I produce music as an apple tree produces apples," proclaimed the French pianist and composer Camille Saint-Saens. Your assignment in the coming week, Capricorn, is to do the research and meditation necessary so you can accurately complete the following sentence: "I produce _________________ as an apple tree produces apples." You need to know beyond any doubt what precise gift you were born to give the world; you cannot move on to the next phase of your evolution until you are utterly clear about what nature yearns to create through you.

Bill Joy is a farseeing computer scientist who developed many technologies for Sun Microsystems, an influential company he co-founded. You Aquarians are now entering into a "Bill Joy" phase of your astrological cycle, a time when you're most likely to be expansive, pioneering, and innovative. Here's Joy's important message for you about what not to do. "My own biggest mistake in the last 20 years was that I designed solutions for problems that people didn't yet know they had," he told Fortune magazine. "That's why some of the things that could've made a difference couldn't find a market. The hardest part isn't inventing the solution, but figuring out how to get people to adopt it." Translation: As you dream up fresh approaches and imaginative departures, make sure you communicate about them with enthusiastic clarity to the people they'll affect most.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Many of the poets I like are mavericks, visionaries, and prophets, and more than a few belong to what poet Ann Waldman calls the "outrider tradition." But since it would be unpoetic to have a closed mind towards more traditional stuff, I've been reading America's new Poet Laureate, Ted Kooser. A retired vice president of a life insurance company in Nebraska, he enjoys yard sales and pork roast. Surprisingly, though, his poetry reveals a wild streak. It's not expressed in descriptions of reckless love affairs and manic excursions to the frontiers of sanity, but in a humble wisdom forged through his brave, unsentimental tenderness. That's the kind of wildness I wish for you in the coming weeks, Pisces: the crafty, loving, constructive kind.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Your current relationship with romance might best be summed up with these words from the Washington Post's Joel Achenbach: "Love begins as a sonnet, but eventually turns into a grocery list. Therefore you need someone with whom you can go to the supermarket." In other words, Aries, realism should rule your decisions in amorous matters for the next few weeks. That will eventually change, though. So don't permanently forget about the sonnet-like aspects of your passion.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Even if you're not a jazz fan, you'll thrive in the coming week by using a modus operandi that resembles jazz. I suggest, therefore, that you improvise frequently. Experiment with intricate, strong, and playful rhythms. Infuse your yearning for freedom with humor. For further insight about how to proceed, meditate on the following clues from three jazz greats. Ornette Coleman: "Jazz is the only music in which the same note can be played night after night but differently each time." John Coltrane: "You can play a shoestring if you're sincere." Miles Davis: "Don't play what's there, play what's not there." 

Want more clues, Taurus? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

One of my best teachers always referred to himself as an unteacher. My goal is to strip away your certainties," he said, "so you can be alert to how mysterious life actually is." He didn't want to fill me up with a load of fixed ideas, in other words, but rather encourage me to cultivate the habit of questioning everything. I wish I could perform the same service for you, Gemini, especially now that you're becoming more receptive to the naked truth. I'd like to help you understand that in order to fall deeply in love with the world's messy beauty, you need to be able to gaze upon it as if it were just created a moment ago. (P.S. As psychotherapist Robert Augustus Masters says, the truth cannot be rehearsed.)

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Young rock bands often do cover tunes, copies of songs originally performed by well-known musicians they admire. Art teachers sometimes give their students the assignment of reproducing the great paintings of the old masters. To take maximum advantage of the current astrological influences, I suggest you use this strategy in your own unique way, Cancerian. Pick a hero, either dead or alive, either famous or unsung, whose approach to life you admire. Find out as much as you can about that person, and then engage in a flurry of imitation. Dress, talk, think, and dream like your hero. In every situation you're in, ask yourself what he or she would do. Have imaginary conversations, fantasize abundantly, and move through your days and nights as if you are that person.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Cancerian? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In the coming week you will be prone to eruptions of intuition about exciting future events that you have not previously imagined. Lucid visions of challenging adventures may pop into your mind's eye out of nowhere. When you come into the presence of people who may one day figure prominently in your creative departures from routine, you might feel chills run up and down your spine. Be alert for these signals from the Great Beyond. It's time for you to become your own fortune-teller. 

Want to explore the coming week even further, Leo? Dig deeper? Feel stronger? Consider tuning in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

It's sowing time, Virgo. Seeds you plant in the coming days will grow into the crop you will ultimately harvest in July, 2005. If you think big, those seeds will also figure prominently in blooms that won't fully ripen until the latter part of 2015 and the first nine months of 2016. I suppose it's possible you'll get freaked out by the pressure, and pretend you don't have the awesome power I'm telling you that you have. In that case, you'll distract yourself with a thousand and one trivial concerns and let blind fate do the seed-planting for you. But I don't recommend that approach. I'd love for you to get excited as you contemplate what you want to be doing 12 years from now.

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Virgo? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"I lost the plot for a while," says a character in Nick Hornby's novel, High Fidelity. "And I lost the subplot, the script, the soundtrack, the intermission, the popcorn, the credits, and the exit sign." I'm betting you could have said something like that recently, Libra. The story of your life seemed to have been whisked out from under you and banished to the wilderness on the outskirts of limbo, where the wasteland meets no man's land. That's the bad news. The good news is that while you may never recover the plot you started with, you'll soon find a brand new one that's better than the original.

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Libra? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"The conversation didn't get interesting until the end, after we ran out of things to say." Blogger Michael Barrish (www.oblivio.com) wrote that about a date he went on. I'd like to recommend it as your guiding principle in the coming week. Your assignment is to choose a person with whom you will talk and talk and talk until you are all talked out. At that point, though, you won't run along to your next appointments, but will dwell in the awkwardness as long as it takes for you to stumble upon a new way of being together. Furthermore, Scorpio, I urge you to apply this approach in as many other ways as you can imagine. Hang out in the pregnant silences on the other side of the climaxes.

No one knows you better than you do, Scorpio. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Physicists have been on a roll for the last hundred years. Beginning with Einstein's theory of relativity in 1905, they've uncovered secrets of the cosmos that would have seemed like magic to nineteenth-century scientists. Yet they still haven't found their Holy Grail-the "Theory of Everything" that would tie together all their discoveries and, in the words of Stephen Hawkings, allow them to "read the mind of God." According to my understanding of the astrological omens, you Sagittarians have been on a similar ride in the past 12 months. You've gathered tantalizing clues to the greatest mysteries of your life, but have not tracked down your personal Theory of Everything. That could change in the coming weeks, though. You're closer to the Grail than you've ever been.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Your immediate future reminds me of the Buddhist monks I saw beaming child-like smiles and waving their arms exuberantly as they rode the roller coaster at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Why? Because I believe that whatever discipline and devotion you have brought to your spiritual work in the past year will soon be rewarded, probably with a thrilling ride that dissolves obstacles or a soaring adventure that breaks down inhibitions.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Capricorn. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

During a six-year period of his life, music composer Johann Sebastian Bach created an average of one cantata every single week. In the coming days, you could be that prolific in your own chosen field, Aquarius. The creative juices should be flowing through you like a tidal wave; your ability to dream up fresh solutions to nagging puzzles should be at a peak. If for some reason none of what I'm saying seems to be true, it means you need to stop what you're doing, go sit under a tree, and listen more attentively to your fantasies.

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Aquarius? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

To achieve your dreams, writes Chuck Klosterman in Esquire, you shouldn't obsess on cultivating allies. The two most important characters in the life of any successful human, he says, are a nemesis and an archenemy. While I don't wholeheartedly endorse this exaggerated position, Pisces, I do recommend it now for your temporary use. Nothing will sharpen your wits so much in the coming weeks as competitors and people who don't agree with you. They will be catalysts who'll provide you with all the motivation you need to leap to the next level of excellence.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Pisces? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Two wrongs may make a right this week. A mistake could lead to a lucky break, and some questionable decisions could result in you looking like a genius. The karma in your vicinity is extremely odd, Aries. It's as if you can't get the opportunities you need unless something goes awry. It's like the only way you can meet your date with destiny is if you're under an illusion about what your date with destiny is.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Aries? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

I'm tempted to address you as "Your Majesty" or "Your Grace." There's something regal about your mood. What's going on? Are you realizing how much power you have to create the life you really want? Are you ready to shake the misguided belief that others are in control of your destiny? I won't be upset, Taurus, if you issue the equivalent of royal decrees in the coming week. And I'll be pleased if you act on Robert Anton Wilson's assertion that "Reality is what you can get away with." 

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Taurus. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

If you believe your body is inherently sinful or if you're offended by references to your private parts, stop reading now. Still here? Good. The fact is, dear Gemini, that this is a perfect time to celebrate, explore, and reinvent your relationship with your genitals. It's your sacred duty to strip away every negative association about them that you may have acquired in the past. Do whatever it takes to arrive at the understanding that your sexual organs are among the most sublime gifts the Divine Creator has given you. Have fun with them, worship them, teach them greater discipline, and in general lift them to the exalted state they deserve.

Want more clues, Gemini? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

This week you may frequently experience a psychological state called "schizofriendia." As defined by one of my readers, Lewis, schizofriendia is a condition in which people hear voices in their heads that are unfailingly supportive, encouraging, and keen to offer constructive advice about how to make the most of everything that happens. It's true, my fellow Cancerian, that in the past the little voices in our heads have only occasionally been reliable sources of information. But they will more than compensate for that during the Golden Age of Self-Healing that's just ahead.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In many cultures, the dove has served as a symbol of divinity, purity, and peace. To Muslims and Christians, for instance, it represents the Holy Spirit. In contrast, the pigeon is often regarded as a nuisance whose prolific droppings are an eyesore and health hazard. And yet the terms "dove" and "pigeon" are used interchangeably for many species of birds; they're essentially the same. I mention this, Leo, because I think you'll have a dove-pigeon thing happening for you this week. A certain situation will have both a lyrical, harmonious side and a banal, bedraggled aspect. They go together; you can't have the dove without the pigeon.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Leo? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

As the relentless nihilism of the mass media threatens to quash our ability to even perceive, let alone exult in life's glorious beauty, we need new words to remind us to see with our own eyes. I have one: mirabilia, which is actually an old term that hasn't been used much in the last 400 years. Its literal definition is "marvels that inspire wonder," but I'd like to add the following nuances: beguiling curiosities, enigmatic joys, changes that inspire amused awe, and sudden deliverance from boring evils. I'm happy to report that you Virgos, more than any other sign, are currently poised to see, create, and attract mirabilia.

Want to explore the coming week even further, Virgo? Dig deeper? Feel stronger? Consider tuning in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I have never before called on the help of actress Mae West to illuminate your horoscope. Her cracked wisdom is so relentlessly arch and ironic that it's rarely useful as advice. Given the extraordinary nature of your current astrological omens, however, I'm now going to be utterly sincere as I recommend that you pattern yourself after her. Mae once said, "When I'm good, I'm very, very good, but when I'm bad, I'm better." For a limited time only, Libra, you have the right to speak these words as if they were your deepest truth.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

You're at the climax of your yearly cycle, Scorpio. That means you have the power to harvest the best possible outcomes of all the themes you've been developing since your last birthday. Here are two pieces of advice to help you make the most of this magic moment. 1. Use the system but don't let it use you. Refuse to believe that any bureaucracy or organization is stronger than you. 2. Frequently ask yourself the following question: "What is the most fun, productive, and liberating action I can take right now?"

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In his live show, "Monster," Irish comedian Dylan Moran tells audience members not to fulfill their potential. "It's like your bank balance," he says. "You always have a lot less than you think. Don't look at it. It's like a locked door within yourself. Leave it that way." A review in The New Yorker reported this rant admiringly, as if it were unique and witty. In my view, though, it's actually hackneyed and idiotic. Most of us have received some version of that cynical advice over and over again. I do think it's important to recognize how prevalent Moran's philosophy is, because then you have more power to reject it. So that's part one of your assignment, Sagittarius: Recall all the times you've been told, either blatantly or covertly, that you have less potential than you imagine. Part two: Open the locked door within you and gaze at your potential, knowing there's a lot more of it than you think.

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In my mind, there are no ambiguities about your immediate future. Here are the three precise formulas that sum up all you need to know. 1. If you clean out the stultifying chaos in your closet, your garage, or your mind, you will set in motion events that will ultimately bring you in contact with fretile, delightful chaos. 2. As soon as you dispense with once-useful stuff you don't need any more, you will be delivered from a supposedly "necessary" evil. 3. If you cut down on your use of careless language and tame your reflex to judge people harshly, you will be given the key to a treasure you didn't even know existed.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

To the Sioux, storms that replenish the earth with heavy rain are Thunder Beings. The Mayan god of fertility and agriculture is the beneficent Chaac, who demonstrates his friendship to humans by sending them thunder and rain. For the Algonquins, Michabo is the creator of the earth and the human race. He is also master of the thunder and wind. Tawhiki is the Polynesian god of thunder and lightning, as well as the provider of good health and he who bestows the skill of building fine houses. I believe that in the coming week, Aquarius, you will have the chance to be in intimate communion with a thunder god or goddess who has much in common with these deities.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

For a decade I've enjoyed observing the long growing cycle of the persimmon tree in my front yard. Its new leaves bud in February, but its fruits aren't ready to eat until December. This July there was an event I've never seen in previous years. A branch became so heavy with ripening persimmons that it broke off and fell to the ground. While it was sad at the time, I now notice that the persimmons on the remaining branches are bigger than they usually are in September. I expect that around Christmas time, I may fewer blooms than in previous years, but they'll be of record-breaking size. The entire scenario I just described is an apt metaphor for your year, Pisces. Whatever you lost a couple of months ago will result in you getting fewer but bigger rewards by the end of 2004.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

With gleeful regularity, the tabloids have been publishing photographic proof that numerous female celebrities have cellulite. Recent additions to the list include 23-year-old Christina Aguilera and 22-year-old Britney Spears. I predict that this trend will lead to a revolutionary shift in perception: Cellulite will be regarded as a mark of beauty-a seductive tattoo provided by nature itself. Many women will actively seek to cultivate it. I urge you to adapt this vignette as your official metaphor of the week, Aries. Take something you've thought of as a weakness or embarrassment, and turn it into an asset.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

After consulting with my think tank, I've decided to temporarily decommission the bull as your power animal. Until the equinox, the rabbit will take its place. It's the only creature that makes symbolic sense for you right now, when both your libido and fertility are turned up to record levels. There's also another reason why the rabbit suits you. In many mythic traditions, the creature is regarded as a crafty trickster that uses playful stratagems to turn every situation to its advantage. This approach should be your modus operandi in the coming weeks.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Historians estimate that at least 25 percent of all the gold ever mined lies at the bottom of the oceans, stuck inside ships that have sunk. Similarly, Jungian psychologists believe that in the depths of our psyches, there are great treasures moldering away, unclaimed by our conscious egos. For you Geminis, this September is the diving season - the time when you're most likely to be successful if you descend into the murky abyss and try to retrieve those lost riches.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Gemini. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft has been flying around the planet Saturn recently. Reporting on its explorations, a story in USA Today had the headline, "Saturn Offers More Mystery, Less Certainty." I photocopied it and sent it to my astrological colleagues, many of whom suffer from a misguided certainty about Saturn's meaning. They dogmatically insist it's a harbinger of contraction and limitation--an oppressive tyrant sucking the fun out of life. But my research suggests the real story is more complex. Saturn can actually be a benevolent guide that pushes you to be more true to yourself. It helps you shed mediocre pleasures and trivial goals that distract you from your high-priority dreams. It forces you to be ruthlessly honest about what's most important to you. I wanted you to know these fun facts, Cancerian, since the ringed planet is in your sign, and will remain there, nudging you to develop the discipline that leads to more freedom, until July, 2005.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In 1810, an inventor in London originated the technique of sealing food in tin cans to keep it fresh. His idea came into wide use in 1846, when companies began to mass-produce food in cans. But there was no such thing as a can opener until 1858. For 12 years, then, consumers had to make awkward use of hammers and chisels to liberate their food from the new-fangled containers. This story line is an apt metaphor for your current situation, Leo. Some time ago, you got hold of a potentially valuable resource, but you have yet to discover how to make it work for you in the best possible way. The coming weeks should change that, though. I bet you'll finally find or create your equivalent of the can opener.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In Greek mythology, Narcissus was the gorgeous demigod who had no desire for intimate relationships but fell desperately in love with his own reflection. From his name comes the word "narcissist," which refers to a person who is excessively self-involved, has an inflated sense of importance, and compulsively craves admiration. I've always suspected that Virgos are the least narcissistic sign in the zodiac. Many of you underestimate your self-worth and don't treat yourself with enough loving kindness. In fact, I sometimes get a mischievous urge to advise you to be *more* of a narcissist - like now, for instance. Here's an experiment I wish you would do: Spend 20 minutes in front of a mirror telling yourself how beautiful you are.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Libran author William Faulkner (1897-1962) regarded his book, The Sound and the Fury, as his "most splendid failure." For a long time, the public didn't do much to dissuade him from that view. The book sold just 3,300 copies in the 15 years after it was published, and by that time most of Faulkner's other books were out of print. I believe the current state of your fate has some resemblances to that time in his life. On the other hand, your destiny in the next 12 months will have more in common with what happened for Faulkner in 1949, when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, and sales began to pick up. Just as *The Sound and the Fury* had much to do with his award, I believe one of your own "splendid failures" will be a key to the renaissance you'll enjoy.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In reviewing the film, "Catwoman," the San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle coined a phrase that describes a mood many of you Scorpios are now prone to: festive pessimism. Frankly, my dear, I would love to talk you into shedding that state. It may give you an aura of murky intrigue, but it's so much less than what the astrological omens say you could possess. The fact of the matter is that the cosmos wants to bless you with an abundance of emotional riches right now. If you agree to suspend some of your jaded attitudes and cynical ideas, you'll be showered with experiences that will justify a full-blown outbreak of festive optimism.

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Scorpio? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Soon the stakes will be higher, the rewards greater, and the judges tougher. You'll have a chance to show who you really are in a bigger, bolder way, and that will be exhilarating. But you'll also be expected to show who you really are in a bigger, bolder way, which could be daunting. The key to success is for you to concentrate so hard on the fun parts of the challenge that you'll render the scary parts irrelevant.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Between North and South Korea is a long, narrow strip of land called the DMZ. Designed to be a buffer zone where all human activity is prohibited, it has accidentally become a nature preserve beloved by white-naped cranes. The area is a paradise for the birds because it has an abundance of undisturbed marshland and is free of predators. Luckily, the cranes are so lightweight that they're in no danger of detonating the many land mines buried throughout the 370-square-mile area. Everything I just described is an apt metaphor for a situation or state of mind that's now available for your use, Capricorn.

No one knows you better than you do, Capricorn. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"If you want to give God a good laugh, tell Him your plans." So says an old Yiddish proverb. While that rule often holds true for most people, I believe you'll be exempt from it in the coming weeks. God is currently very receptive to your schemes, especially if they emphasize your readiness to give more beauty, truth, and love to the world. In fact, the more precisely you formulate an intention to be generous and soulful in everything you do, the more likely it is that the Creator will laugh *with* you, not *at* you, and cheerfully conspire to assist you.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes," says "Dilbert" cartoonist Scott Adams. "Art is knowing which ones to keep." According to my analysis of the astrological omens, Pisces, August was your time to embody the first part of Adams' formula. During these past few weeks, I hope you gave yourself permission to unleash many fertile booboos. September, on the other hand, should be devoted to carrying out Adams' second proposal. Which of August's missteps might have marked the raw, imperfect appearance of ideas that will eventually turn out to be useful and brilliant?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Last June, a rickety raft carrying 42 destitute African refugees washed ashore on a posh nude beach in Spain. Visualize that scene, Aries. It will serve as an apt metaphor for your life in the coming week. A forlorn, vulnerable part of your life will come face to face with a luxurious, beautiful part. And what will unfold in the wake of this juxtaposition? Let's hope it will be similar to the scene in Spain, where the naked sunbathers leaped into action and got help and care for the refugees.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Beginner's mind" was originally a Zen practice. Many artists and thinkers now use it to stimulate their creativity. To achieve this blessed state, you dispense with all your preconceptions and enter each situation as if you're seeing it for the first time. "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities," wrote Shunryu Suzuki in his book, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, "but in the expert's there are few." As much as I love beginner's mind, though, I have an even more important assignment for you this week, Taurus: Cultivate a beginner's heart. Approach every encounter with love as if you're feeling it for the first time.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

While visiting relatives in Fort Collins, Colorado, I borrowed a ten-speed and rode down the most delightful urban bike path in the world. As I pedaled for miles past parks, wetlands, and fields of wild flowers, I felt gratitude for the visionary planners who had created such a sanctuary in the midst of a city of 120,000 people. I hope you can be like that bike path in the coming week, Gemini: a source of relaxing beauty at the heart of the hubbub; a calming yet inspiring influence that motivates the people around you to act with maximum integrity.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Staring into my computer screen is not necessarily the best way to get inspired for the task of creating your horoscope. After analyzing the astrological omens, I often wander out into nature in quest of inspiration. Today's jaunt took me all the way to Mt. San Pedro, a place I'd never explored before. Upon reaching the top, I found a panoramic vista that revealed three of the bridges that cross San Francisco Bay. As I surveyed those monumental connecting links, my intuition turned to you. A sudden breeze came up, and I heard a voice in my head say, "It's weaving time for the Crabs. Tell them to splice and unify and join together."

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In 2001, Mitzi Nichols of Virginia Beach anonymously donated one of her kidneys to a stranger. She got paid nothing for this rare act of generosity, and after recovering from surgery went back to her job as a cashier at a gift shop. It took the universe three years to figure out a way to compensate her properly. This past June, she won $500,000 in the Virginia state lottery. I call this to your attention, Leo, because I believe you're in a phase when your acts of no-strings-attached largesse will generate karma similar to what Nichols set in motion three years ago. Like her, however, your rewards may not arrive right away, and they might come from sources with no apparent link to the recipients of your kindness.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Your life will always be unfinished business, Virgo. From now until the day you die many years hence, you will be a work in progress. There will never come a time when you have everything figured out. I urge you, therefore, to find a way to feel at peace with this incompleteness--or better yet, to love and celebrate it. Luckily for you, the coming weeks will bring you some of the sweetest, juiciest imperfections ever.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Creativity expert Roger von Oech takes issue with the old saw that a chain is no stronger than its weakest links. He thinks they're indispensable. "Many systems have weak links designed into them," he says. They're called 'fuses.' When a system gets overloaded, the fuse blows and saves the rest of the system." Judging from the astrological omens, Libra, I'm pretty sure you'll soon get to play the role of a fuse yourself. Whatever group or structure you're part of needs to break down for the sake of its long-term health--and you're the best candidate to lead the way.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)
New York Times rock critic Jon Pareles bemoans the withering of the Beastie Boys' comic feistiness. As they've become politically aware and socially responsible, the white hip hop artists have toned down their anarchist braggadocio and shameless troublemaking. Now the fun is almost gone. Pareles says it has been "like having the Three Stooges decide they want to become a panel of appellate judges." I wonder if it might have been possible for the Beastie Boys to evolve a more positive and compassionate outlook without losing their deliciously scandalous spunk. I pose a similar question to you, Scorpio: Can you imagine becoming both kinder and wilder?

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

It's time for you to intensify your levels of Sagittariusness--to become even more of a Sagittarius than you've ever been before. Here are a few tips on how to proceed. 1. Always keep your basket overflowing with options. 2. Don't laugh unless you really mean it, and then unleash a belly laugh. 3. Embrace optimism for both its beauty and its tactical advantage. 4. Be fiercely allergic to fraud and injustice. 5. When pursuing a goal, crank open your peripheral vision and be prepared to get from A to Z in an A-J-C-X-E-Q-R-B-Z fashion. 6. Add new stamps to your passport regularly. 7. Know how to have fun even when life sucks. 8. Remember that you'll regret adventures you didn't do more than those you did do.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The astrologer Forest Fickling did a statistical study of 50,000 people, analyzing the data to determine which signs were the best and worst in various categories. He found that Capricorns work the hardest, accomplish the most in the shortest time, and daydream the least. But I hope you'll rebel against these natural inclinations in the coming weeks. Between now and September 16, I think you'll achieve the greatest success possible if you daydream a lot more and don't work as hard as usual.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Soon I'll begin my annual pilgrimage to the world's wackiest utopia, the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. Of the many ways it refreshes my spirit, the most important is its absence of money, advertisements, and commerce. The temporary community of 30,000 people is run as a gift economy. Nothing is for sale. No one can buy anything. When goods and services are exchanged, it's because they're given freely. I wish that you, Aquarius, could experience the unprecedented relaxation that settles in when you're utterly free of being hustled. I wish you could live for a time without worrying about finances. I especially wish you could do this now, when you have a prime astrological opportunity to reinvent your relationship with money. If you can't make it to Burning Man, what else might help you in this noble task?

No one knows you better than you do, Aquarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

It's your Unbirthday season, Pisces--that upside-down, backwards, yet oddly full-of-grace time halfway between your last birthday and your next. I can't buy each of you an Unbirthday present, but if I could, it would be a gift certificate to the Pirate Supply Store in San Francisco. There you could buy Jolly Roger flags, eyepatches, plundered treasure chests, lessons in how to whistle while eating saltines, tubs of lard (good for hair-styling and skin moisturizing as well as cooking), and a broadside featuring the text, "The Journey of the Fishes Overland." Believe it or not, all these would be quite practical. They'd inspire you to cultivate a devil-may-care mood, which would be perfect during your Unbirthday season. (A Web version of the store is at http://www.826valencia.org/store/, and no, I don't get a kickback.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Get used to the fact that you're going to feel good about your life and bad about your life maybe eight times a day every day," advises healer Carolyn Myss, "and clear about your life and confused about your life 25 times a day. Your journey is to get to the point where you realize: 'Hey, this is just passing through me.'" While I personally think there's more to your journey than that, it's an excellent discipline that will serve you exceedingly well. And the coming weeks happen to be a perfect time, Aries, to improve your mastery of this subtle yet heroic art.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

There are no longer enough Catholic priests in North America to fulfill all the requests for divine intervention that are received from parishioners. The requests are therefore outsourced to churches in India, where up-and-coming young clergy pray over them at $5 a pop. It's too bad the powers-that-be apparently don't know about me and my team of Prayer Warriors, because we perform the same service absolutely free. To demonstrate our effectiveness, we plan to unleash a series of powerful prayers on your behalf. Specifically, we will beseech God to bless you in the coming weeks with cathartic pleasures that will permanently expand your capacity for happiness.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"Most of us cannot imagine the wheat beyond the bread, or the farmer beyond the wheat, or the history beyond the farm," writes Wendell Berry in Resurgence magazine. "Most people cannot imagine the forest and the forest economy that produced their houses and furniture and paper; or the streams and the weather that fill their pitchers and bathtubs and swimming pools with water." In my astrological opinion, Gemini, you can't afford to be like the people that Berry describes. To give your life the ballast it will need in the coming weeks, you've got to have a vivid appreciation of all the good things that sustain you, as well as a more intimate understanding of their origins.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

You haven't been singing and dancing and laughing and playing enough lately. You haven't been telling yourself jokes as you drop off to sleep or leaping off the couch during the exciting parts of your favorite TV shows or going ten miles out of your way to track down the exotic sensation you're in the mood for. Either get more serious about having fun, Cancerian, or I swear I'll show up in your dreams in the form of a giant crab running amok in a place where you take everything too seriously.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I have nothing against Leo diva Jennifer Lopez, but I wouldn't normally recommend her as a role model for you. She's a bit chilly and remote and self-absorbed, whereas I always like to encourage you Leos to cultivate warmth and conviviality and generosity of spirit. But after seeing the magazine ad for Lopez's perfume, I'll make an exception. "In the eye of the storm," the text reads, "I am still Jennifer Lopez." Please adopt this for your own use in the coming week. Say to yourself ten times a day, "In the eye of the storm, I am still [your name here]."

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Some astrologers say that Virgos tend to be so obsessed with small details that they neglect to focus on the big picture; that they get so bound up in seeking perfection that they miss out on life's messy beauty and slightly flawed glories. But even if there is a grain of truth in those ideas, they've temporarily become irrelevant. In the coming weeks, you'll be drawn to carry out the task Henry Miller described as follows: "to keep the miracle alive, to live always in the miracle, to make the miracle more and more miraculous, to swear allegiance to nothing, but live only miraculously, think only miraculously."

Libra (September 23-October 22)

You may think you need a teacher or genie or rescuer, but I say you don't. I say that what you need most is to realize that right now you are your own best teacher and genie and rescuer. In my astrological opinion, you should drop any fantasies you have that there's someone out there who will save you or give you what you lack or reveal the secrets that will fix everything. For the foreseeable future, you won't get what you need until you're prepared to provide it entirely by yourself.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Are you Scorpios controlling manipulators? You can be, yes. But sometimes that's a good thing. Here's an example. When you have a leadership role in a group project, you may have to be a bit controlling and manipulative in order to keep other people's raging egos from sabotaging the goals of the project. In a case like that, however, you also have a great responsibility to monitor your own power drives. You've got to make sure you don't get so juiced up by the battle of wills that you end up sabotaging the goals of the project yourself. The whole point of being a benevolent manipulator is to serve the greater good, not your own selfish needs. These meditations will be crucial for you to keep in mind in the coming weeks.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Sagittarian poet Emily Dickinson had little interest in traditional religion. She referred to the Bible as "an antique volume written by faded men," and called the god worshiped by her conventional parents many unflattering names, including "The Eclipse." And yet, writes critic John Burt, "her poetry is charged with an anguished, naked, mystical confrontation with the divine." This is a perfect astrological time for you to shift towards a more Dickinsonian approach, Sagittarius. I dare you to renounce any dry, timid, safe, lifeless abstractions you might have about the Divine Wow, and instead seek out raw, sweet, wild, direct communion.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Here's one of the few mottoes it would be healthy for all of us to live by: Wash your brain once a month, whether you think it needs it or not. I hope you've faithfully followed that rule in recent months. If not, please do the job with extra vigor in the coming week. Scrub and dry-clean and disinfect your brain until it's purged of all shoddy theories, decrepit dogmas, and ill-fitting beliefs borrowed from people you no longer trust. It's especially important to do this now because you'll soon be in astrological phase when your capacity for expanding your worldview will be at a peak. To make yourself as receptive as possible to all the good ideas that will be ready to flow into your imagination, you need to clear out some space.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Through a friend of a friend of a friend in the publishing business, I've caught wind of a mysterious manuscript that may soon be turned into a book. It's called I'm the Boss of My Underpants. My source was maddeningly vague about the subject matter, but it sounds like something I'd love you to get your hands on as soon as possible. In the coming weeks, you'll need to get crystal clear about who exactly is the boss of your underpants. You should also devote a lot of thought to defining the rules that will govern your underpants in the future, including the important issues of where and when and with whom you'll take them off.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

One of my specialties is trying to be tolerant of people who are intolerant of me. My motto is "I refuse to dehumanize anyone, even those who dehumanize me." I recommend that you practice this difficult art in the coming week, Pisces. You're in a phase when it's crucial to bolster your integrity, and playing nice with those who don't play nice would be great exercise. But there's another important reason to do this: Feeling even low levels of contempt and disdain would shut down your intuition. And that's something you can't afford as you come to a turning point in your work on the dark side of your life.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To be an authentic Aries, to be the person you were born to be, you've got to pretty much always be mobilized by someone or something that thrills your heart. Who and what are those beacons for you right now? A person who fascinates you? An adventure you're planning or an idea you're exploring? A devoted animal who always sees the best in you? A place in nature where you remember who you really are? Whatever you love, Aries, pay homage to them this week. Build shrines in their honor. Take action to demonstrate the depth of your excitement. If your beacons are human beings, write them thank-you notes, sing them songs, or tell them the truth about their life-giving sustenance.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

A few years back, the commissioners of Kleberg County, Texas retired the salutation "hello" because they said it contained the offensive term "hell." In its place, they made "heaven-o" the official county greeting. That's borderline lunatic, if you ask me, and yet I understand the principle. In fact, I recommend that you initiate some adjustments in your own language, Taurus. As much as possible, you should stop using words that make you feel bad, confused, or weak. Replace them with fresh terms that make you feel optimistic and empowered. Of course, this is good advice for everyone all the time, but it's especially apt for you right now. The astrological omens suggest you have a special capacity for changing deep-seated habits that sap your energy, especially those involving the way you speak.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

In Half Magic, a children's book by Edward Eager, four kids discover an enchanted coin with an odd quirk: It grants just half of any wish. Naturally they try to compensate, imagining how to double the scope of each wish so that when only 50 percent of it comes true, it's exactly what they wanted. Your immediate future has certain resemblances to their story, Gemini. Though you will be in possession of a kind of magic, it may tend to work incomplete wonders. Consider imitating the kids' strategy: Make your wish larger than what you actually need.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

From the day we're born till the day we die, we need teachers. In a perfect world, each of us would have at least one mentor who looked after our learning needs, constantly adding new lessons to our ever-evolving curriculum. Since you probably haven't been living in a perfect world, however, you may have only rarely been blessed with the luxury of a personal educator. You've mostly had to be your own guide, with an occasional assist from me. Here's one of those assists now: In the next six weeks, you should put a high priority on developing a long-term lesson plan. What things do you need to learn most between now and August, 2009?

Leo (July 23-August 22)

There is an Egyptian myth that the sun was in Leo and the moon in Cancer when the universe was created. That very configuration is happening this week, which is an interesting coincidence. The astrological factors indicate it's an excellent time for you to recreate your own world. So don't be shy, Leo. Shed any doubts you might have about your authorial power. Imagine you're a god or goddess with the potency to dream a new dream of how life could be. Then get out there and start conjuring it up.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In his book, Legacy of the Heart: The Spiritual Advantages of a Painful Childhood, Wayne Muller traces many of our psychological ills to the bad habit known as "repetition compulsion." After growing up, we unconsciously recreate the situations that damaged or addled us as children. In this way we hope to find the healing we couldn't find when we were young. We choose friends and lovers and employers who inadvertently play the roles of our original family members as we continually restage our old imprints in search of some feeling of resolution that will set us free. That's the bad news, Virgo. The good news is that the next six weeks will bring the best opportunity ever to escape from repetition compulsion.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

The first theme you should weave into your life in the near future is over-the-top, cathartic laughter. We could almost say, in fact, that you've entered the Season of the Belly Laugh. The second theme you need to find a prominent place for is ecstasy. I'm not talking about the drug, but rather the natural experience of over-the-top, cathartic pleasure. It wouldn't be a lie to suggest that you've slipped into the Season of Wild Fun. The third element you should invoke is over-the-top catharsis. I'm not exaggerating when I say you're in the Season of Peak Emotion.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The news media love bad news because they think it's more interesting and worthy of our attention than good news. The nineteenth-century poet John Keats said, "If something is not beautiful, it is probably not true," but many of today's journalists imply that if something isn't ugly, it's not true. The wide acceptance of this bizarre perspective colors our personal rhythms. We're prone to the delusion that a well-lived life is mostly a struggle; that it's normal to feel we're in a constant battle against the natural tendency of everything to fall apart. But right now is a perfect time for you to divest yourself of this nonsense, Scorpio. I urge you to devote your intelligence and passion to changing your beliefs about the nature of reality. Focus on what's beautiful and successful. Create opportunities for high-integrity pleasure. Have a fierce intention to find joy. Be a tough-minded optimist.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

To the ancient Chinese, pigs were sacred because they could eat anything, and turn it into energy. The creatures were regarded as masters of transmutation. Nothing, not even garbage, was unusable to them. The Chinese aspired to be like pigs in the sense of being able to learn from and derive benefit from every experience, not just the tidy, tasteful ones. I mention this, Sagittarius, because it's an excellent time for you to imitate that paragon of holiness, the omnivorous pig.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The old days are threatening to dominate the headlines this week. In fact, unless you're proactive to the point of being pushy, a worn-out history will insinuate itself into your future. And unless you err on the side of generosity as you settle accounts with two people who used to be an important part of your life, they will continue to demand your precious energy long after they have any right to. To acquire the ballast necessary to keep the past in its proper place, make a pilgrimage to a place where you triumphed over the old days once before.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"I need more Grace than I thought." That's a line from a Rumi poem in which the poet confesses he's sometimes helpless in the face of life's unpredictable twists and turns. It's a mournful statement; he's sad at having to acknowledge he's not always the master of his own destiny. Yet I sense he also means he feels relief in surrendering to the need for grace. It's liberating to accept the fact that he can't possibly be a wise, effective genius who controls every detail and aces every test. I hope you'll arrive at Rumi's state soon, Aquarius. I trust you'll derive power from saying, "I need more Grace than I thought."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Sometimes the demons that are like mosquitoes are more dangerous than the demons resembling dragons. You go on full alert in the face of the dragons' threats, calling in all your favors and hauling out your biggest guns. But you may underestimate the power of the mosquitoes to mess with you, and not be aggressive enough in shielding yourself from their subtly demoralizing effects. Don't let this be the case in the coming week, Pisces. Don the persona of a heroic warrior as you take extreme measures to exorcise the mosquito demons.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Charles Baudelaire counseled readers to be drunk continually 'on wine, on poetry, or on virtue, as you wish,'" wrote Kate Taylor in The New Yorker. "But he also thought drugs were a perversion of our taste for the infinite and that great minds could furnish their own intoxicants." I'm hoping you're one of those "great minds" the French poet was talking about, Aries. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you need a large helping of the magic that lies outside of ordinary consciousness. But you're far more likely to thrive if you can find a natural way to satisfy your "taste for the infinite."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

To hint at the potentials of the coming week, I'll appropriate the words of avant-garde music composer and author, John Cage. In describing his work, he once said,  "I have nothing to say/ and I am saying it/ and that is poetry." Here's an altered version, Taurus, created especially to suit your current astrological needs: You have nothing to do/ and you are doing it/ and that's your genius.

No one knows you better than you do, Taurus. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

The gods have authorized me to give you three tough but sweet oracles. Ready? 1. If you hope to be in the right place at the right time to hear the words that will set you free, you'll have to act with both more confidence and more humility. 2. To learn the clue that will heal an old rift, you'll have to really want to know what's going on beneath the official version of the truth. 3. To find the hidden beauty and inspiration in an initially awkward mess, you'll have to respond without anger to a message that feels threatening to your pride.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Your actions in the immediate future could have a potent impact on your long-range future. For instance, new connections you forge in the coming weeks -- especially if you leave your comfort zone to make them -- will be valuable if you decide to leave your current dream home and head to a new dream home next year. Here's another example: If you spend some time this August trying to fix a glitch in the way you communicate, 2005 may bring a dramatic enrichment of your sense of community and a surge of grace in your family dynamics.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In describing his creative process, novelist Jack Kerouac said, "The first thought is the best thought." When Allen Ginsberg was asked "What's the best advice you can give a poet?", he echoed Kerouac. On the other hand, Nobel Prize-winning writer William Butler Yeats constantly revised works he had already published, even fiddling with poems that were many years old. Pierre Bonnard was so committed to editing himself that "he was once caught trying to retouch one of his own paintings hanging on a museum wall," wrote poet Linh Dinh, who concluded, "Last thought is the best thought." While there are valid arguments for both views, Leo, the astrological omens say your best bet for now is to go the way of Kerouac and Ginsberg.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Before you can move on to your next exciting challenge, you'll have to answer a few hard questions about the life you've lived since your last birthday. The object of this test is not to make you feel guilty, but to help you take inventory of your gaffes and indiscretions so you can make atonement, thereby clearing a path to the future. Have you purposely caused anyone pain? Did you tell any big lies? Did you commit any unethical acts? Have you revealed information told to you in confidence? Do you owe money or energy to anyone you have no intention of paying back? Confess everything, Virgo--to the mirror. Then go set things right, or at least as right as possible.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Virgo? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"If the landscape reveals one certainty," wrote Annie Dillard in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, "it is that the extravagant gesture is the very stuff of creation. After the one extravagant gesture of creation in the first place, the universe has continued to deal exclusively in extravagances, flinging intricacies and colossi down aeons of emptiness, heaping profusions on profligacies with fresh vigor." In my astrological opinion, Libra, it is your duty to resonate with this particular aspect of the cosmos. For the next few weeks, you have license to overflow with floods of self-expression; you have the right to create like a god who has the pleasure and privilege of creating a new world.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Libra. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

A Taoist parable tells of a poor farmer who owned a single horse. One night it ran away. The neighbors came to offer condolences. "What bad luck!" they said. "Maybe," the farmer replied. "Maybe not." A week later, the fugitive horse returned, accompanied by six wild horses. The farmer and his son corralled them. "Lucky you!" the neighbors cried. "Maybe," the farmer said. "Maybe not." Soon the son tried taming the new arrivals. A stallion threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. "Terrible luck!" the neighbors wailed. "Maybe," said the farmer. "Maybe not." The next day, soldiers visited the village. Strife had broken out between two warlords, and one had decided to conscript the local young men. Though every other son was taken, the farmer's boy was spared because of his injury. "What fantastic luck!" the neighbors said. I think this story captures the essence of your coming week pretty well, Scorpio.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In the middle of a moonlit night last February, someone in the English town of Pembury sneaked into the yards of over a hundred homes and secretly planted an ash sapling in each one. It was hard work. The weather was bad and each tree needed a hole dug to accommodate it. Judging from your current astrological omens, Sagittarius, I believe you'll soon be the recipient of a gift like that. Other good surprises may be on tap as well, especially if you say a prayer in which you tell God or Goddess that you're ready, willing, and able to receive all manner of unexpected benevolence.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The saliva of vampire bats appears to be effective in dissolving the blood clots that cause strokes. Ongoing research into the medical applications of snake venom suggests it may ultimately be used to fight cancer, heart attacks, and mad cow disease. And I suspect that in the coming weeks, Capricorn, you will be healed by a small dose of an experience that in large doses has felt noxious to you in the past. Keep your mind open to the possibility. Don't automatically avoid everything that seems unpleasant.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

You are more ready than you've ever been for the kind of intimacy that the poet Adrienne Rich extols: "An honorable human relationship -- that is, one in which two people have the right to use the word 'love' -- is a process, delicate, violent, often terrifying to both persons involved, a process of refining the truths they can tell each other." I'm not implying, Aquarius, that you should find a relationship where you can continually break down your self-delusions and dig for the raw truth. Nor am I insisting that you should prod one of your existing relationships to leap to this higher octave. But I am saying that you have the strength and courage to try it.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Visionary educator Maria Montessori believed that self-discipline motivated by a child's own enthusiasm is far better than discipline imposed on the child by a strong-willed authority. What's the best way to develop the superior form? Kids need to understand the difference between good and evil, and even more importantly, they must not associate good with passive immobility and evil with animated activity. I believe her argument will be useful for you to meditate on in the coming weeks, Pisces. It's an ideal time to bring more order, efficiency, and discipline into your rhythm. And the best way to do that is to cultivate an irrepressible desire to perpetrate aggressive acts of generosity and good will.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Two years ago a diminishing marriage rate and an increase in divorces began to worry Malaysian officials. The family development minister issued a plea for spouses to be more aggressive about calling each other "darling," "sweetie," and other affectionate names. As you slip into the Amorous Season, Aries, I'm going to ask you to do that, plus more. Supercharge your entire approach to speaking the language of love. Be aware of how powerful your words can be in stirring the emotions of people you care about. Use your voice to experiment with romantic potentials and bring more truth and beauty into your intimate moments.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Since 1977, 40 percent of U.S. elementary schools have done away with recess. Meanwhile, among adults at work, the time allotted to lunch is steadily shrinking. Executives spend an average of just 42 minutes with their midday meals. This dangerous trend hits you Tauruses the hardest: You need spaciousness. You shouldn't and can't be rushed to do anything. That's why I'm calling on all Bulls to launch a Mass Slowdown in the coming week. Take all the time you need to do whatever has to be done, whether it's enjoying your sandwich or preparing an important report. From an astrological perspective, it's a pivotal moment for you to be faithful to your own internal rhythms. If anyone complains, tell them your astrologer made you do it.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I suggest that you encourage your right hand to get into a wrestling match with your left hand. Let them go at it for as long as it takes for one to emerge victorious. They desperately need to engage in a vigorous dialogue, and the best way for that to happen is in the heat of battle. It's true that while their struggle rages, you may be too preoccupied to worry about the thousand and one questions that are begging for your attention. But I'm betting that many of those questions will be resolved or rendered irrelevant as your right hand and left hand get to know each other better.

No one knows you better than you do, Gemini. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Warning! Too-much-of-a-good-thing alert! Take a few deep breaths and consider the possibility that sweet satisfaction may be on the verge of mutating into overripe excess. Examine your life to see whether well-crafted luxury is in danger of becoming grandiose exorbitance or whether your fair share is close to becoming too hot to handle. I'm not saying any of these developments have occurred yet; just that they might unless you take action immediately. As a Cancerian myself, I know how we Crabs sometimes indulge in the fantasy that hoarding stuff protects us from the world's unpredictability. Though it can on occasion, this is not one of those times.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

From an astrological perspective, it's a perfect time to order a custom-made action figure that looks and talks like you. You'd really benefit from having a miniature version of yourself to play with. You could dress it in superhero costumes, fantasize scenarios in which it pulls off epic feats, and use it to help you escape the imaginary constraints that have been inhibiting you lately. But getting a doll of yourself is expensive, and there are other ways that would probably work just as well to free up your bold, adventurous spirit. Maybe you could write a short story starring you as a daredevil or pioneer. Or how about embarking on a series of strenuous physical activities that will awaken your dormant reserves of willpower? If nothing else, create a sock puppet of yourself.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Leo. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I met a man who told he trademarked the term "couch potato" more than two decades ago. He said that in the early years, he made decent money from people who compensated him for the right to use his intellectual property. Eventually, though, he had to hire lawyers to take legal action against those who wanted to avoid payment. In time, his attorney fees outstripped the amount he was able to collect from violators of his trademark, and he gave up the effort. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you Virgos are facing or will soon face a comparable situation: A certain advantage you've had may no longer be an advantage; an asset or strength could begin to require so much upkeep that it may no longer be an asset or strength.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

You've been blessed and cursed with arduous lessons these past months, Libra. They have compelled you to navigate your way through the most challenging archetypes of all: death and rebirth. Before these trials, you may have considered yourself smart and capable but wondered how strong you were. Now there is no doubt: You're more courageous than you ever imagined. But don't stop pushing yourself to the limit yet. Your hero's journey still has a few weeks to go. Keep doing what you've been doing, only more so.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"Disabuse yourself of the notion that greatness is somehow inextricably linked with fame, power, wealth, or social stature," writes one of my readers, Pyrrol Red. "Some of the greatest human beings have been mostly unknown." This is an important point to keep in mind, Scorpio, as you seek to ascend higher. The essence of your beauty may never be fully appreciated by more than a few people; the gifts you have to offer are so subtle and complex that you might find it hard to encapsulate them in simple forms that gain wide popularity. I'm not saying you'll never be famous, powerful, wealthy, or high-status. But even if you do win those perks, it will be because of decisions you make and actions you take that are free of all lust for them.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"The future enters into us, in order to transform itself in us, long before it happens," wrote Rainer Maria Rilke in Letters to a Young Poet. That's a good description of what will be happening inside you in the coming weeks, Sagittarius. But keep in mind that this lovely invasion may not be accompanied by fireworks and thrilling music. It might unfold in a series of what Rilke called "seemingly uneventful and motionless moments."

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Anthropologists say that in every culture in history, children have played the game of hide and seek. I've observed that most adults still engage in sublimated or disguised versions of the game. They may withdraw emotionally and expect their friends and loved ones to telepathically figure out what's going on with them. Or they may play hard to get, forcing their lovers or spouses to come find them in their secret hiding places. Judging from the current astrological omens, Capricorn, I suspect you will soon be embroiled in a hide-and-seek ritual. You might as well try to have fun.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

My hypnotherapist friend has noticed a common theme running through the lives of many of her clients: They take their blessings for granted and underestimate the power their blessings afford them. One client, for instance, seems to assume that everyone in the world is as perceptive and sensitive as she is. As a result, she doesn't completely appreciate how valuable these skills are, and she doesn't fully take advantage of the tremendous influence they could help her wield. You suffer from a similar blindness about your own gifts, Aquarius. Luckily, this is the perfect time to change that.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The Bureau of Justice says that crime in America is at its lowest level since it was first tracked in 1973. Canada's crime rate has also been declining for years. So why is everyone walking around scared all the time? In its "Personal Security Index" report, the Canadian Council on Social Development said, "The fear of crime is disproportionate to the true risk of being victimized, and that fear can be a negative factor in people's lives, often unnecessarily restricting their social activities." I bring this up, Pisces, because it's a perfect moment for you to dramatically reduce your levels of dread and anxiety.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A newlywed couple I know is planning to go to Cuba for their honeymoon. That's pretty risky. The American government has sternly discouraged us citizens from traveling there for years, and President Bush recently laid down even further restrictions. But I admire my friends' desire to combine their romantic getaway with swashbuckling drama. It shows they intend to keep their relationship feisty, free from the ravages of excess comfort and convention. I suggest that you cook up a similar excursion, Aries. Love will thrive on adventure, and vice versa.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

It's a perfect time to reinvent the past. You'll unearth interesting discoveries if you explore the old days with a critical, objective eye. Look for discrepancies between how you remember things and what really happened. Consider the possibility that some of your memories aren't really your own, but other people's interpretations that you've unconsciously absorbed. By August 15, I hope you'll be ready to correct the story you tell yourself about your history.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Responding to hate-mongers who want to ban gay marriage, the American Anthropological Association said this: "The results of a century of anthropological research on households and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support for the view that viable social orders depend on marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution." In fact, the evidence suggests the opposite: "A vast array of family types, including families built on same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies." Make these thoughts your starting point, Gemini, as you re-imagine the kind of family you want to create for yourself in the future. There's no need to be loyal to any of the narrow dogmas your culture tries to foist on you about the right way to live together with people you love.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Is there a lack of money in your life? If so, and you do nothing but whine about it in the coming weeks, your energy levels will decline. If, on the other hand, you develop a plan to pad your bank account -- even if that plan doesn't ultimately work out -- you'll become better looking and your health will improve. It's possible, of course, that you're one of the lucky people whose financial life is thriving. If so, and you do nothing but spend your money on yourself in the coming weeks, your energy levels will decline. If, on the other hand, you share your wealth, you'll become better looking and your health will improve.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

You'll be glad to know you're coming to the end of the Suffering Season. If you've made it through these past few weeks with your sense of humor intact, you now have cosmic permission to give yourself a big shiny reward. To make the best of these last few days, carry Henry Miller's declaration around with you: "Everything we shut our eyes to, everything we run away from, everything we deny, denigrate, or despise, serves to defeat us in the end. What seems painful can become a source of beauty, joy, and strength, if faced with an open mind. Every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such."

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Many creative people feel compelled to mirror the pain they witness, making art that is as desolate as the experience it represents. Greek poet Odysseus Elytis mourned this phenomenon. He believed that artists in its grip are like people with healthy legs who choose to limp along with broken crutches. "During the time of Buchenwald and Auschwitz," he said, "Matisse painted the most charming flowers and fruit ever made. They still speak more eloquently than the most macabre descriptions of the period. Their creator was faithful not to the tragedy but to the reaction that tragedy kindled in his conscience." I call on you, Virgo, to respond as Matisse did when you encounter people going through trials and tribulations in the coming days. The best gifts you can give them are your joy and vitality.

This week I'll give you nine of Darryl Cherney's 20 "Rules of Activism." Honed during his many years of protecting the environment, they should be useful to you as you fight for justice and liberation in your own sphere. 1. Never turn down help. 2. Don't believe your own BS. 3. Speak in plain language. 4. Find the truth in what everyone says. 5. The most interesting things sometimes happen last. 6. Advance planning is overrated. 7. Seize the moment. 8. You never succeed the same way twice. 9. Surf the tidal wave.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The astrological omens suggest that I should urge you to be far bolder than usual. They even seem to be saying that the more brazen you are, the bigger your rewards will be. In fact, Scorpio, if I'm reading the signs accurately, you might want to draw your inspiration from the 40 starving artists in Paris who broke into an abandoned building near the Louvre a few years back. They built studios inside and have been squatting rent-free ever since. Now the city of Paris has bought the building and is paying $3.5 million to renovate it so that the artists can continue to thrive there. Be like them.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Developed by the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, the Waldorf system of education is designed to cultivate the soul as well as educate the intellect. Waldorf teachers say it's crucial that young children aren't pushed to master academic subjects prematurely. One sign that the time is ripe, they believe, is when a kid begins to spontaneously draw butterflies. This suggests that his or her soul has completed its chrysalis stage. I bring this up, Sagittarius, because every time I turn my meditations to you lately, I get visions of you drawing butterflies. Does it mean you've completed an adult version of the soul's metamorphosis?

Though musician Stevie Wonder has been blind since birth, he has recently begun to drive a Rolls Royce. His "road" is a flat, empty airfield where he's not in danger of crashing. I suggest you Capricorns draw inspiration from his example in the coming weeks. Create a safe place where you can experiment with an activity you've always avoided because of a supposed handicap or lack of natural aptitude.

You've been suffering from an excess of rational behavior and logical thinking, Aquarius. It's high time for some poetry. I don't so much mean reading poetry as being and doing poetry. Here are some ideas to get you started. Wash your feet in a river. Lie on a green hill and sing lullabies to the person you'll be ten years from now. Eat the petals of a pansy or violet or nasturtium. Thank your mother for the pain she endured while birthing you. Give yourself a secret name, then spell it out on the ground with pine needles. Assume you have psychic abilities, and read people's minds. Sip tea in the rain. Dream you're a hawk soaring over a volcano.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Joan Borysenko is a medical researcher and psychologist who has written several books on how to synergize the efforts of mind and body in cultivating good health. I respect her work, but was appalled at a statement she made recently to an interviewer. "The most sobering discovery," she said, "is that we will never truly heal the wounds of our past." My own experience suggests that some people have suffered some irremediable hurts. But on countless occasions, I've also seen brave, dedicated souls completely fix what had been broken in them.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Two years ago, scientists discovered a secret underground river running more than 800 feet below a Mauritanian town in the Sahara Desert. With a flow rate of 8,450 gallons per hour -- enough to supply the needs of 50,000 people -- it is the biggest unnamed river in the world. I predict that you'll soon make an analogous find in your own domain, Aries. What is the valuable resource that has always been near you, but hidden? Any day now, you'll know.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

I took a long, meandering walk today. After an hour, I found myself in an unfamiliar neighborhood on a wide paved road. In the middle of a long straight stretch there were two street signs next to each other. The one on the right -- the direction from which I had come -- said "Split Drive." The one on the left -- where I was headed -- said "Union Avenue." There was no intersection here and no bend in the road to mark the change -- no apparent distinction at all between Split and Union. Now study all the details I just reported, Taurus. They're symbols for your life in the coming week.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Golfer Phil Mickelson has had an odd career. During his first 12 years as a pro, the 34-year-old Gemini won 22 tournaments and earned more than $25 million. But because he had never finished first in any of the four major tournaments, sports writers branded him as a loser. When he finally captured the top spot at the Masters last April, they acted as if he had exorcised some terrible ancient curse. I suspect that many of you Geminis will soon be subject to expectations and pressures as absurd as those once directed at Mickelson. Please resist the urge to buy into them. Don't let anyone manipulate you into trying to live up to their pathological standards of success.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

To pump up their volume above the prevailing human din, some nightingales in big cities have learned to unleash 95-decibel songs, matching the loudness of a chainsaw. I'd love to see you make a similar push, Cancerian, because let's face it: If your output remains at its current level, you'll continue to be half-invisible, never making the impact you should. So raise your intensity, please. Whatever you've been doing to express your uniqueness, do it louder. However you've been contributing your beauty to the world, do it bigger.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"Dear Dr Brezsny: I need someone to rescue me! My therapist fell asleep during our last session! Even my mother won't return my calls! And the man I love just told me he's not emotionally attached to me and is planning to marry a woman he's known for six weeks! I'm smoking too much and drinking every night and crying myself to sleep. I'm afraid I'll end up as a middle-aged cat lady wearing a housecoat and sponge rollers in my hair, drinking gin straight out of the bottle! I need some bright, wise soul to restore me to health and wholeness and hope! -Lamed Lioness."
	Dear Lioness: According to my reading of the astrological omens, there's a special person who'll soon be in a perfect position to rescue you. That person is you yourself! The same thing's true about a majority of your fellow Leos: They're on the verge of becoming their own saviors. Any minute now, you'll all know exactly how to convert your breakdowns into breakthroughs.

No one knows you better than you do, Leo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I think what you're about to experience is summed up well by the bumper sticker I saw today: If a pig flies, don't criticize it for not staying up long. In other words, Virgo, the most righteous response to the wonders you've been experiencing is delighted gratitude -- even if the wonders don't quite live up to their initial promise or your early expectations. Ironically, this approach is the only one that will make it possible for the pig to fly again in the future.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Your life has brought you many maddeningly inconclusive adventures. On occasion, you've probably been tempted to invest what was left of your battered faith in the doctrine proclaimed by Gertrude Stein: "There ain't no answer. There ain't going to be any answer. There never has been an answer. That's the answer." But now the time has come for you to suspend your belief in Stein's theory and others like it. During the next five months, I predict that you will be given more precise, definitive answers than you've ever had before.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Libra. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Each day many of your cells expire and are replaced by others. As long as you live, this relentless process of death and rebirth never abates. Periodically, then, you have a completely new set of flesh and bones that retains none of the same atoms you were composed of earlier. Think back, for example, to the physical body you inhabited in July of 1999. There is nothing left of that old thing! In a sense, you have reincarnated without having to endure the inconvenience of dying. Do you realize how free this makes you? In the coming week, Scorpio, take full advantage of this gift. Show how much you appreciate it.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

The Bible's Book of Revelation is one of the world's most notorious advertisements for doom and gloom. Millions of people actually think the wacky yet terrible visions laid down in that ancient text describe future events. Few of the believers live in Beijing, China, fortunately. When a swarm of locusts like those prophesied in Revelation arrived in the area in 2002, local residents greeted the creatures warmly. They scooped them up in large bags, deep-fried them, and turned them into the main dish of an enormous feast. I urge you to make a similar reversal of a fearful scenario that someone's trying to foist on you, Sagittarius.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Contrary to the orthodox notion that sperm headed towards an egg are in a deadly competition with each other, researchers have discovered they collaborate, often joining together to create a "love train" so as to reach the target faster. Using this as your inspiration, Capricorn, see if there's an area of your own life that you've misjudged as being a hotbed of cutthroat rivalry. The astrological omens suggest that it's a perfect time to awaken and cultivate the cooperative potentials of such a situation.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)
Tjiliwirri is a special language taught to adolescent boys undergoing initiation rites among the Warlpiri tribe of the Australian Aborigines. A speaker uses it to express the opposite of what he pretends to mean. In order to convey the meaning, "You are tall and wise," for instance, a boy might say the Warlpiri equivalent of "You are short and short-sighted." To express a yearning for greater fulfillment, he may declare, "I have no needs." Regard this vignette as instructive about your immediate future, Aquarius. In the coming weeks, I believe you will undergo a kind of initiation that dares you to rise to a new level of maturity. In the course of this rite of passage, you may have to navigate your way through situations that are the opposite of what they seem.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Two years ago, seven-year-old Steven Olson was awarded patent number 6,368,227 for a new method of swinging on a swing. His application said that kids can get bored just moving back and forth on the swing or twisting the swing's chains to make it spin. That's why he invented the technique of swinging side to side. Will he get rich from selling the rights to use his patent? Probably not. Now let's talk about how all of this applies to you. I think you should pull off your own version of Olson's coup in the coming weeks -- but see if you can take it one step further. Dream up an innovation that makes a fun experience even more fun, and meditate on how you might then exploit it to your practical advantage.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

One of the most exuberant poets of the twentieth century was James Broughton. "I pray every night to wake up crazier," he wrote. By that he meant he wanted to become increasingly receptive to unpredictable joy and pleasure. His knack for having a good time didn't mean he dodged the hard times, though. "Suffering can't be avoided," he told interviewer Jack Foley. "The way to happiness is to go into the darkness of yourself. That's the place the seed is nourished, takes its roots and grows up, and becomes ultimately the plant and the flower. You can only go upward by first going downward." That's the perfect prescription for you in the coming days, Aries. (Here's more Broughton and Foley.)

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Your word of power this week is yua. It's a term the Yupiit people of Alaska use for the spirit that inhabits all things, both animate and inanimate. A rock, for instance, has as much yua as a caribou, spruce tree, or human being, and therefore merits the same measure of compassion. If a Yupiit goes out for a hike and spies a chunk of wood lying on a frozen river bank, she might pick it up and put it in a new position, allowing its previously hidden side to get fresh air and sun. In this way, she would bestow a blessing on the wood's yua. Try living your life like this in the coming days, Taurus: as if absolutely everything is alive, has a soul, and deserves your loving kindness. (Thanks to Earl Shorris, "The Last Word," Harper's, August 2000.)

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"Goodies" is your word of power this week, Gemini -- though it could also be your word of weakness. To ensure that it's more the former than the latter, meditate on the following three inquiries. 1. Of all the goodies you want, which are the two most important ones? 2. Do your flirtations with second-tier goodies tend to undermine your pursuit of the first-tier ones? If so, are you willing to wean yourself from those flirtations? 3. Do you have any doubts about whether you truly deserve the very best goodies? If so, what can you do to render the doubts irrelevant?

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In accordance with the astrological omens, I've assembled a host of snappy one-liners for you to wield in the coming week, Cancerian. Sooner or later, it will make sense for you to utter every one of them. 1. "It only seems kinky the first time." 2. "Even if the voices in my head aren't real, they still have some good ideas." 3. "To make your prayers come true, you have to get off your knees." 4. "I'm the good kind of bad." 5. "It's not really a party till something gets broken." 6. "Shut up and dance." (P.S.: I don't anticipate there'll be any messy consequences if you cultivate the attitude I'm suggesting here. But in case there are, invoke this disclaimer: "I didn't do it. You can't prove it. Nobody saw me.")

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Have you ever been burned by bad religion? This is the week you could start getting rid of the scorch marks. Have you ever been abused by an authority figure who made you feel helpless? This is the time to correct for the distortions that jerk wreaked in your psyche. Are you feeling tyrannized by a habitual response that was once quite useful but isn't appropriate any more? This is a perfect moment to dissolve it.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Thirty-three-year-old pop star Jennifer Lopez earned $29 million in 2003. Presumably she shares some of her wealth with her mom, Guadalupe. Cynical observers might therefore regard it as a sign of divine favoritism that Guadalupe recently won a jackpot of $2.4 million while playing a slot machine at an Atlantic City casino. I suspect you may be less hasty to jump to that conclusion, though, since many of you Virgos are currently being visited (or soon will be) with an equally ridiculous amount of good luck. Don't feel guilty about your blessings in the least, please, even if they seem way beyond your fair share. Lap them up.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

For years, Salt Lake City was undisputed Jell-O champion on the world, with the highest per capita consumption. But in 1999, Des Moines, Iowa catapulted into the lead. In response, chef Scott Blackerby staged a "Take Back the Jell-O Title" Recipe Contest at his restaurant in Salt Lake, and thousands of Utahans signed petitions that helped make Jell-O the official snack of the state. Soon the city had retaken the top spot, where it remains to this day. I hope this story serves to motivate and inspire you in the coming days, Libra. It's time for you to reclaim a lost title or crown that you once possessed and that really should belong to you again.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

On your bad days, Scorpio, you're like a swamp that serves as a weird oasis in the midst of frozen tundra. On your good days, the physical feature you correspond to most is an underground river winding in a serpentine course beneath green, fertile hills. But in the coming weeks you'll be like a place you've rarely resembled before: an unspoiled tropical beach where the warm wild ocean meets the foot of a towering mountain.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Shopping for a new mission, Sagittarius? Or perhaps a new branch of your old familiar mission? You should be. This is one of those pivotal moments when heaven comes all the way down to earth; when invisible allies from the other side of the veil make an appearance; when age-old secrets briefly show what they're really made of. To aid your quest to glimpse your best possible future, here's advice that the sorcerer Don Juan gave to his student, Carlos Casta√±eda: "Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary. Then ask yourself, and yourself alone, one question. 'Does this path have a heart?' If it does, the path is good; if it doesn't, it is of no use."

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In ancient Greece, Apollo was a great sun god. Ruler of music and healing, he had the power to vanquish darkness from the human soul and transform chaos into energy. Pilgrims traveled from afar to seek oracles at his main temple in Delphi. Inscribed above the entrance of the temple was the maxim "Know thyself." No other words of wisdom are more important for you to heed in the next six weeks, Capricorn. Getting to know yourself better will be the best way to rouse your own inner Apollo, thereby allowing you to tap into the fertility of your unconscious chaos and harness the beauty of your soul's darkness.

"I didn't feel your passion in my secret garden," a celebrity judge told an aspiring diva after her less-than-perfect singing performance on "The WB's Superstar USA," an "American Idol" parody. I'm afraid I'm going to have to borrow his words to describe your recent efforts, Aquarius. All of us occasionally fail to live up fully to our potential, and the recent past has been your time of missing the mark. Now please don't waste your energy getting mad at me for delivering this knock. Instead, channel that emotion into making sure you don't keep missing the mark. Conjure up the breakout passion that we who love you *will* feel in our secret gardens.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Here's one of the few universal truths I know: Everyone has a piece of the truth, even those you disagree with. According to my reading of the astrological omens, though, you are now in possession of a giant piece of the truth -- bigger than what you usually have and bigger than everyone else's piece. That's exactly why you should proceed cautiously. Your deep understanding and authoritative knowledge might tempt you to dismiss the tiny slivers of truth that other people are holding, and that would be a mistake.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

July is Reinvent Your Family Month, and today begins Home Improvement Week. Your short-term assignment is to beautify your sanctuary. Get rid of stuff that tends to keep you locked into sterile memories, and fill the place with fresh symbols and accessories that make you excited about the future. That should get you in the mood for the more demanding task, which is to change whatever needs to be changed in order to create the exact family feeling you have always wanted.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

You need to laugh more this week than you've ever laughed before. I'm not exaggerating, Taurus. Mirth is not just food but also medicine for your soul. It's an absolute necessity, not a luxury. I'm talking about amusement as a way of life, not a pleasant diversion; as the attitude that underlies everything you do, not just an occasional escape into frivolity. You probably have some ideas about where to begin: which funny friends you should hang out with and which comedians you should expose yourself to. But in order to fulfill your assignment, you'll also have to track down new laugh-inducing stimuli; you'll have to expand your capacity to be delighted.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Some mistakes are too much fun to make only once. Wouldn't you agree? And that's one reason I'm authorizing you to repeat a naughty or excessively rowdy adventure from the past, Gemini. Here's another reason: The same series of actions that had an awkward result way back when will lead to a breakthrough this time. That's what I predict, anyway -- especially if you add a little tenderness to your mischief this time around.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I propose that you conduct a radical experiment for the next three weeks. Between now and July 22, try on the theory that life is on your side. Assume that all of creation is conspiring to give you exactly what you need, exactly when you need it. At least once every day, speak these words with passionate sincerity: "I believe that reality is a sublime comedy staged for my education and amusement, and that there is a benevolent conspiracy to liberate me from my ignorance and help transform me into the unique masterpiece I was born to be."

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Astronomers recently discovered a planet-like world orbiting the sun beyond Pluto. They called it Sedna, a name they said was derived from the Inuit deity that created the Arctic's sea creatures. They didn't realize that the myth of Sedna is far more complicated. She is the Dark Goddess, embodiment of the wild female potencies that are feared yet sorely needed by cultures in which the masculine perspective dominates. Dwelling on the edge of life and death in her home at the bottom of the sea, Sedna is both a source of fertile abundance and a mysterious prodigy. Shamans from the world above swim down to sing her songs and comb her long black hair. If they win her favor, she gives them the magic necessary to heal their suffering patients. In the coming weeks, Leo, Sedna is your special ally. Call on her power as you work to cure the part of you that you've thought would always be wounded.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

This may be the turning point your grandchildren will tell stories about years from now: the time you leap over the abyss to the other side of the Great Divide and begin your life in earnest. On the other hand, this moment of truth may end up being nothing more than a brief awakening when you glimpse what's possible on the other side of the Great Divide, but then tell yourself, "Nah, that's waayyyy too far to jump." In that case, your grandchildren will have to be content talking about what delicious cookies you used to bake or what your favorite sports team was. It will all depend on how brave you'll be.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

The Monster Raving Loony Party is a political party that nominates candidates for British elections. Its goal is to inject invigorating mayhem into a process that everyone takes far too seriously. Here are a few of its proposals: Anyone using a cell phone in a theater must be squirted with silly string; joggers should be required to run on giant treadmills that generate electricity for public use; and Britain should be towed 500 miles south to improve the climate. I call on you, Libra, to create a branch of the Monster Raving Loony Party in your own locale. Or at least inject some medicinal teasing into the political intrigues you're having to navigate, whether they're in your family, workplace, or social circle. The astrological omens say you now have a knack for lightening up group dynamics that have become way too heavy.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The astrological omens are telling me you need a vacation from media babble. That's probably the only way you'll be able to tune in to the crucial messages that are being sent out by the still, small voice within you. Do you have the willpower to carry out this heroic discipline? I dare you to unplug your TV and keep your radios turned off. Avoid films. Don't even open up a newspaper or magazine. It would also be great if you'd boycott computers. But if that's impossible -- if you have to stare at a computer screen for the sake of your work -- then check your email just once a day and don't surf the Web aimlessly. Create a silence that's deep enough for the still, small voice to be heard.

Gypsy Rose Lee (1914-1970) was not a stripper in the sense we think of it today. Her more precise title was striptease artist. During her performances, she never actually took off all of her clothes. Her style was rooted in the advice her mother gave her: "Make them beg for more -- and then don't give it to them." While I don't suggest you apply for a gig at a strip club this week, Sagittarius, I do recommend that you incorporate some of Lee's approach in your own chosen field.

The emotions in your vicinity are about to get very interesting. Here's a rapid-fire flurry of advice to match the fluttery, fluctuating rhythm you'll be navigating. Day 1: Don't fight the problem; make yourself bigger than it. Day 2: Become better acquainted with the part of yourself that sometimes does things unconsciously. Day 3: Allocate more funds and resources for foreign affairs. Day 4: A little rebellion will prevent a debilitating weakness from erupting. Day 5: Prove your love not with sentimental sweetness but with exuberant adventure. Day 6: Talk about the two things you never talk about.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

This will be a bad news, good news kind of week, Aquarius. But the bad news will be small in proportion to the good news, and may even be necessary for the good news to occur. For instance, a mosquito might keep you up all night. That, in turn, could lead you to call in sick for work, spend the day rethinking your whole life, and decide to make a dramatic move that will change everything for the better.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

My Piscean friend Risa dreamed that the Buddhist monk and teacher Thich Nhat Hanh wanted to give up his celibacy to pursue a romantic relationship with her. She was flattered -- the man is a brilliant saint who has written more than 20 books -- but she ultimately decided to stick with her husband. The night after she told me this dream, I dreamed that my three best Piscean friends were making love with Mother Teresa, Buddha, and the 16th-century Kabbalist holy man, Isaac Luria. From this evidence, as well as certain astrological data, I conclude that you Fish are in the midst of trying to integrate your spiritual and sensual yearnings. To expedite this exciting process, I suggest you murmur exuberant prayers during your sexual encounters this week.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"Let that which stood in front go behind!" roared Walt Whitman in his poem "Respondez!" "And let that which was behind advance to the front and speak." That's the first clue you should meditate on in the coming week, Aries. Your second hint is from Bob Dylan, who could have been talking to you when he wrote these words for his song, "The Times They Are A-Changin'": "The slow one now/ will later be fast/ And the first one now/ will later be last."

Are you the type of person who is capable of altering your trajectory in midair? Let's say, hypothetically speaking, that you worked in the circus as a human cannonball. Let's say you had just been shot out of a cannon but sensed you were headed towards a spot on the ground a few feet beyond the safety net. Could you wiggle or shimmy in such a way that you accomplished a mid-course correction, ensuring that you landed where you wanted to? In my astrological opinion, Taurus, you could.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

According to my research, astrologers and economic forecasters are about equally accurate in their predictions. The difference is that some astrologers can provide useful financial advice, whereas most economists can't distinguish a Mercury-Saturn conjunction from a transit by retrograde Venus. Given the fact that you're in a phase when you'll thrive on financial advice from a metaphysical perspective, I suggest you seek input only from the first type, the business-savvy stargazers. And since I'm one of them, I'm happy to offer you this tip: Having a sensitive soul and spiritual yearnings are often impediments to getting richer quicker, but for now the reverse is true for you.

I have a pleasant assignment for you, Cancerian: Decide what form of abundance is most important to you. Is it money? Friendship? The land you own? Is it romantic love or creative inspiration or your children? Of course you probably value several different kinds of abundance, but your challenge right now is to determine the one that you prize above all others. Whatever you decide it is, it will flourish in the next four weeks.

You've got that look in your eye, Leo -- that slightly demented, fervently giddy expression I see in you every now and then. Judging from previous experience, I surmise you're about to either launch a brave quest to the frontiers of your understanding or else hurl yourself into a sticky abyss where all the demons adore you. You realize there's a difference, right? One is scary fun and the other is glamorous torment. Please go to your room, take a hundred deep, slow breaths, and meditate about what you should do next to prove how much you love yourself.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Wal-Mart is famous for the stingy pay and benefits it offers its employees. But another giant chain store, Costco, is the opposite. It's so good to its workers that some business gurus disapprove. "From the perspective of investors, Costco's benefits are overly generous," says retail analyst Bill Dreher, quoted in the Wall Street Journal. He thinks the company's benevolence depresses its stock value because investors are afraid its profit margins aren't as high as they could be. But the fact is that Costco is very successful, and its five-year growth rate has been 10.1 percent annually, better than Wal-Mart's 9.8 percent. All this is preface, Virgo, for my warning that your gifts may also be criticized in the coming week. Be unfazed, please. Have faith that the best way to build your prosperity is to cultivate your generosity.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

According to my reading of the astrological omens, you're about to receive a burst of attention -- maybe even be offered your 15 minutes of fame. If you don't especially care about being seen on TV, quoted in the newspaper, or gossiped about by professionals, you should negotiate with fate to bring you a heightened visibility that's more useful and interesting. How about having your good work get more recognition and appreciation from the few people who really matter, for instance? I'm sure you can have a lot of influence on how your higher profile manifests, Libra. All you have to do is get very clear about what you really want.

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Libra? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Your magical powers will be at a peak in the coming days. Reading people's minds will be the least of what you're capable of. I wouldn't be shocked if you were able to concoct love potions in your kitchen, get useful tips from the spirits of the dead, or control the weather in your vicinity. Given the fact that you'll be able to accomplish wonders I can't even imagine, I'm reluctant to make a suggestion. Who am I to give advice to a potential superhero? But I feel it's my duty to let you know that the very best use of your magical powers will be as follows: to help those in need, to fight for justice and freedom, and to conjure up miraculous sex.

No one knows you better than you do, Scorpio. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Have you ever seen that bumper sticker that goes, "I am brilliant and talented, but I have to do dumb and self-destructive things to relax"? Studies at the Free Will Astrology Think Tank have shown that a far higher percentage of Sagittarians exemplify this bad habit than any other sign. Even if you aren't dominated by it, you probably fall victim to it every once in a while. That's the bad news. The good news is that you now have the power to break its hold on you. By August 1, with hard work and a little grace, you could very well have earned the right to put the following bumper sticker on your car or refrigerator: "I am so brilliant and talented that I've discovered how to relax in uplifting ways that enhance my brilliance and talent."

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Sometimes Zen masters with valuable teachings appear in the form of children playing or old folks in fading health or boring geeks you look down on. On occasion, crucial help can't arrive any other way except through bewildering riddles you barely understand or seemingly trivial distractions that appear to be wasting your time. It's one of those phases right now, Capricorn. To get you in the mood, here's some foolish wisdom from ex-baseball player, Yogi Berra: "When you come to the fork in the road, take it."

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Capricorn. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"Dear Reverend (or is it Irreverend?) Brezsny: After long meditation on what's missing from my relationship with God, I found the answer: a sense of humor. I realized I can never truly love or honestly communicate with a Supreme Being who doesn't chuckle. Alas, there doesn't seem to be a single text in any religious tradition that's even slightly funny. Can you give me some hope? - Aquarius in Search of a Droll Deity."
	Dear Aquarius: You're in luck. According to my inside sources, the Divine Creator will soon unleash Her comic genius in your vicinity. You can expect a flood of playful teases, mind-bending jokes, and slapstick disruptions in the conventional wisdom -- all designed to provoke sacred, cleansing laughter. Here's even better news: She'll be laughing with you, not at you.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In his poem "The History of My Life," John Ashbery poignantly refers to the death of his brother as a child. He quickly follows it with self-mocking humor about how fast that sad event forced him to grow up. "Ashbery is always vacillating between the unbearable heaviness and unbearable lightness of being," Fred Moranarco writes in The American Poetry Review, "as if moving between the two make both extremes bearable." I expect this will also be your forte in the coming week, Pisces: the ability to flow gracefully between profundity and frivolity, between penetrating explorations of complex mysteries and sweet celebrations of breezy delight. (P.S.: Unlike Ashbery's experience, your dive into the depths won't involve death.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Current human life expectancy is already at 78 years, and it's steadily increasing. So if you're 30 years old, you can expect to be alive for at least another 48 years, and probably longer. If you're 22 you could easily be here for another 60 revolutions of the Earth around the sun, and if you're 45, you've got a minimum of 33. So what are you going to do with all that precious, spacious time? I encourage you to let your brainstorms flow freely in the coming week. Is there another career or two you might want to pursue? A far-flung locale where you'd like to live for a while? An adventure that may take a long time to get ready for? Have fun visualizing the enormous magic you could accomplish little by little in the next three decades.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Naturalist John Burroughs was addressing your current needs when he wrote the following: "The lesson which life constantly enforces is 'Look underfoot.' You are always nearer to the true sources of your power than you think. The lure of the distant and the difficult is deceptive. The great opportunity is where you are. Every place is the center of the world." Let's finish up this little pep talk, Taurus, with some advice from Theodore Roosevelt: "Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"Never test the depth of the water with both feet," the old saying goes, and usually I endorse such an approach. But not now. For the next two weeks, Gemini, you're exempt from that and just about every other cautionary rule. As far as I can tell, your future is so wide open that the only guiding principles you need are those that give you permission. Here's an example you might like, formulated by sex researcher Alfred Kinsey: "The only unnatural sex act is one you cannot perform."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Until recently, Indonesians thought their country consisted of about 17,000 islands. But in February of 2003, an analysis of satellite images found more than a thousand undiscovered islands, bringing the total to 18,108. I suspect that you're on the verge of making a comparable breakthrough about yourself, Cancerian. There's much more of you than you ever imagined. Many previously unknown territories will soon come into view. It will be as if you have unearthed a new world right in the midst of the old one.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Lions and jaguars can roar, but they can't purr. Cheetahs and snow leopards can purr, but can't roar. Now and then a tiger in captivity learns how to produce a sputtering imitation of a purr in addition to its characteristic roar. But as a rule, every species of feline does one or the other but not both. To meet your dates with destiny in the coming week, you'll have to be like a kind of cat that doesn't exist in nature: one that purrs with sublime contentment and roars with fierce authority.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Your theme this week is careen-stable. Here's Rebecca Rusche to tell you of the term's origin and how to recognize when it shows up in your life. "In high school, my mom used to let me use her VW Beetle to go to basketball practice. One night after practice, a friend and I were chatting and drinking Coke when we decided to see how fast we could get the Beetle going down a nearby dirt road. Soon we were careening at 65 mph, shouting 'careen!' every time we hit a bump and went flying into the air. When we arrived back at the gym and got out of the car half an hour later, we saw my Coke can sitting on the front bumper next to the license plate. I nudged it softly to see if it was lodged in there somehow, but it fell right off -- wasn't stuck at all. I thought, 'There must be a word for this magic,' and thus 'careen-stable' was born. It came to mean anything that maintains its poise in the midst of wild, fast movement."

Libra (September 23-October 22)

A couple from Houston had been trying to conceive a child for ten years. Finally, with the help of in vitro fertilization and fertility drugs, Jeffrey and Sheryl McGowen succeeded extravagantly. Two eggs were implanted in Sheryl, and both split. Nine months later she gave birth to two sets of identical twins. "I think God has a sense of humor," said Jeffrey. "He took a vacation, and when he got back from it he answered all of my prayers at once." Keep this story in mind, Libra. It will help prepare you for what God does for you upon returning from vacation.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"Poets should welcome all opportunities to become befuddled," writes poet Linh Dinh in The American Poetry Review. "To not know what's happening forces one to become more attentive." Whether or not you're a poet, Scorpio, I heartily recommend this approach to you in the coming weeks. The feeling of having wandered off the path will be a sign of grace. To be confused will be a blessing. The only possible way you could miss out on the gifts that life wants to send you is if you act like a know-it-all who's in complete control.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You can stir up sweet synchronicities by intensifying your connection with anyone who is an alternate version of you. So negotiate with your evil twin, Sagittarius. Inspire and incite your alter ego. Throw a bone to one of your imitators and leap to the next level with a kindred spirit. Slip in and out of the fourth dimension with your soul twin, send a message in a bottle to your future self, and pose a riddle to your shadow.

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Visualize a tall, thick, steel column that has been forged to serve as part of the foundation of a huge building. It's hauled to a construction site by a truck, held vertically by a crane, then driven into the ground by an enormous pile driver. The clanging of metal against metal rings out. Eventually, the bottom of the pillar is planted deep in the earth, destined to become a key part of the superstructure that will hold together tons of concrete, wood, and steel. Have you got that picture in your mind's eye, Capricorn? I think you're a lot like that pillar right now. Though you're weary of being pounded by the pile driver, you know it's in a worthy cause. And the good news is that the pounding is almost finished.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"If you removed all of the homosexuals and homosexual influences from American culture, you would be pretty much left with the TV game show, 'Let¬ís Make a Deal.'" So proclaimed famed wit Fran Lebowitz. I'd wager that similar statements can be made about the cultures of every country where this horoscope is read. So wherever you live, Aquarius, let Lebowitz's observation be the starting point for your meditations this week. Think of all the beauty, creativity, and vitality that live in the world around you because of people whose relationships with gender are different from the standard models. For that matter, think of all the interesting experiences that have come your way--and may soon come your way again--because of your own refusal to strictly adhere to gender stereotypes.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"Don't rub the lamp unless you're ready for the genie." Nine out of the ten astrologers I polled for this horoscope said that this is excellent advice to give you right now. The tenth stargazer sneered, "Most Pisceans are never ready for the genie." My perspective is different from both the majority and the minority. I say, go ahead and rub the lamp immediately. Why? Because I'm privy to this bit of inside information: Nine out of the ten voices in your head are currently chanting, "I'm totally, absolutely, beyond-any-doubt ready for the genie."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

While living in Manhattan in the 1950s, avant-garde composer John Cage felt beleaguered by the omnipresence of radio sound.  Rather than piss and moan, he wrote a musical piece that featured several radios tuned to different frequencies. After that, he was always able to respond to street radio noise with a pleasant sense of "They're playing my song." According to my reading of the astrological omens, Aries, this is a perfect strategy for you to borrow in the coming week. Turn something that bothers you into something that comforts you, enhances you, or both. (Thanks to Ruby for inspiring this horoscope.)

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

One of my readers, Elizabeth Whitsage, told me a story of when she was working at Disneyland selling mouse-eared balloons. Every so often a mother, father, and young son would come up to her, the parents asking in enthusiastic voices "What color do you want?" and the son answering "Pink!" One parent, usually the father, would recoil in horror and say something like, "No, son, don't you want red or blue?" But before the child could reply, Elizabeth would whip a pink balloon out of the bunch and wrap its string around his wrist. Then she'd smile and say to the dad, "That'll be one dollar, please." Keep this story uppermost in mind during the week ahead, Taurus. Make sure that you always get and always give your personal equivalent of the pink balloon.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

From an astrological perspective, last January wasn't an ideal time to make New Year's resolutions. I'd be surprised if you kept any of the promises you made back then. On the other hand, now is a perfect moment to make New Year's-type resolutions. Here are a few free samples to inspire you. 1. "I resolve to seek out conversations that are so intense and interesting that I lose track of time." 2. "While in the throes of road rage, I resolve to howl like a wolf." 3."I resolve to unashamedly pray for cash, enjoy how messy my room is, and sing along loudly with the muzak in public places."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Jean-Dominique Bauby was a 43-year-old editor when he suffered an unusual stroke. Though his brain remained undamaged, his entire body was paralyzed except for his left eye. Slowly he learned to communicate in code by blinking, and over the next two years he dictated a memoir. Feeling as if he were trapped in a diving bell, but with his imagination as free as a butterfly, he called his book The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Critics have described it as "inspirational" and "a jewel." Bauby is your role model during this last difficult phase of your yearly cycle, Cancerian. Though you won't suffer from any physical affliction, your psychic turmoil may make you feel imprisoned and inaccessible. And yet I promise you that you can find a way to liberate your mind and convey luminous truths to the people who matter.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I don't know if you're the type of person who enjoys trance-dancing half-undressed till 4 a.m. at bacchanalian parties, then prowling the early morning streets barking at the moon and singing songs from Broadway musicals with loony companions until you end up playing strip poker outside an all-night diner as the sun comes up. But if you are that type of person, this will be a perfect week to indulge your inclinations. If you're not, please find an equivalent adventure that you're comfortable with. 'Tis the season to be rowdy.

I propose that you drink a toast to Virgo actress Sophia Loren, who has been in a hundred movies during her long career. To do so may help you take maximum advantage of this phase of your astrological cycle, when your instinct for creating abundance and longevity is at a peak. Are you game? Say this: "May the spirit of Sophia Loren come to me in my dreams and reveal her secret of enduring success." I suggest you also visualize Loren's fortieth birthday, when her husband gave her a custom-made, 14-karat-gold toilet seat. Then drink a toast to yourself, saying: "As compensation for all the times that fate has kicked my ass over the years, may I now receive a reward that's as luxurious as Sophia Loren's magic toilet seat."

This is a perfect time to translate your recent inner changes into a visible form. If you're an artist, start work on a masterpiece that reflects your fresh insights. If you're a businessperson, dream up novel approaches to making money from doing what you love. If you're a politician, get yourself a new spin doctor. If you're between gigs, experiment with your physical appearance. However you do it, Libra, show the world vivid evidence of how you've transformed.

Aeschylus, the seminal playwright of ancient Greece, wrote over ninety plays, but most did not survive the ravages of time. The evidence for his renown has consisted of just seven works. Recently, however, archaeologists have discovered an eighth, "Achilles." It was on a papyrus scroll stuffed inside an Egyptian mummy. This summer, a theater company in Cyprus will stage the play for the first time in over 2,000 years. I urge you Scorpios to be alert for ways this story can serve as a metaphor for your personal quest in the near future. What old but dynamic parts of your life have been all but lost? How can you regain access to them and make them work for you now?

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Color psychologists say that red stimulates emotional intensity. It can raise the temperature of love and awaken feelings that have been subconscious or dormant. Given the rich potentials for deepening intimacy that are now available, you may therefore want to add more red to your apparel and environment. On the other hand, be aware that red can cloud objectivity and make negotiations more jarring. Since you and your partners will probably want to agree on some common goals, you should include calming blue in the mix. Not too much, though: An excess of blue can cause a chill.

My analysis of the cosmic omens suggests that you have one major assignment this week, Capricorn: to kill germs. I'm referring to both the physical and psychic versions of those tiny invaders. There'll be more of them than usual trying to mess with you. As a public service, I'll remind you of the factors that are most effective in zapping pests of all kinds: hot soapy water, fresh air, sunshine, orgasms, and tears.

It's the perfect moment to ask you a question I've been thinking about posing for a long time, so here goes. I'd like to know if you're willing to push hard to get better, improve your attitude, grow your devotion to the truth, fuel your commitment to beauty, refine your emotions, hone your dreams, face your shadow, cure your ignorance, and soften your heart -- even as you pledge to always accept yourself for exactly who you are with all your so-called imperfections, never demeaning the present moment by comparing it to an idealized past or future.

"More good has been launched by more people from kitchen tables than any other platform in the land," says populist writer Jim Hightower, quoted in Orion magazine. I hope you take his words to heart, Pisces. Even if your power spot is normally in an office or store or art studio, this week it will be at your kitchen table. Even if you normally like to brainstorm with your allies at restaurants or bars or on long walks, this week you should gather them at your kitchen table. The dreams and schemes you hatch there in the coming days could change the course of history.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

There is a Native American nation that white people call the Winnebago. The tribe's members refer to themselves, however, as the Hotc√¢gara. That's your first metaphorical clue for the week, Aries. You should firmly correct anyone who misnames or misidentifies you. Here's another tip, courtesy of the Hotc√¢gara. In their origin myth, the great god Earthmaker wakes up to realize he is the only being in the universe. In his abysmal loneliness, he weeps. His tears become the oceans and rivers and lakes of our world. I suspect that the tears you cry in the coming week will also, like Earthmaker's, be profoundly creative.

In his book The Gulag Archipelago, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn documents the Soviet Union's oppression of many ethnic groups between 1918 and 1956. "Only one nation would not give in, nor acquire the mental habits of submission," he noted. "These were the Chechens. They never sought to please, to ingratiate themselves with the bosses . . . No one could stop them from living as they did." I don't mean to imply that the manipulative pressures coming to bear on you, Taurus, are anywhere near as severe as what the Chechens experienced. In fact, your version might be rather covert or subtle. But I urge you, nevertheless, to stand up in defense of your independent spirit with a Chechen-like clarity and ferocity.

At this point in your journey, Gemini, your free will is a more important factor in determining your fate than the constraints of karma or the whims of the gods. I won't waste your time, then, predicting what may or may not lie ahead. Instead, I'll invite you to formulate self-fulfilling prophecies about the beautiful future you want to create. To help tease out your brainstorms, I offer you a few of the laws of life articulated by Hawaiian shaman Serge Kahili King: 1. The world is what you think it is. 2. There are no limits; everything is possible. 3. Energy flows where attention goes. 4. Now is the moment of power. 5. To love is to be happy. 6. All power comes from within.

"Dear Dr. Brezsny: Last night I dreamt I was returning home from a horrid date with a man who didn't even know my name. As I came into the living room, the heating duct flew off, and hundreds of rabbits started pouring in. At first I didn't mind, but then they started to attack me. Long story short, I was eaten alive by cute cuddly bunny wabbits. Comments? -Apparently Delicious Moon Child."
	Dear Moon Child: I think you're dreaming for the entire Cancerian tribe. Here are some possible dream interpretations. 1. You've been too nice for your own good lately. 2. Your extreme, almost manic fertility is leading you to do things that aren't healthy for you. 3. You should minimize contact with anyone who doesn't see you for who you really are, and you shouldn't indulge people who take advantage of your nurturing sweetness.

"Leafing through Forbes or Fortune is like reading the operating manual of a strangely sanctimonious pirate ship," wrote Adam Gopnik in The New Yorker. My perspective is a little different. I think of Forbes and Fortune as the Bibles of the world's pre-eminent religion, the Holy Orthodox Church of Business As Usual. It's a cult we all have to come to terms with and pay tribute to. What's your relationship with it, Leo? Have you made your peace, or are you in a state of tormented denial? If it's the former, the next three months will be a favorable time to increase your income. If it's the latter, you should consider going on a financial vision quest.

[Note: In the spirit of the epic yet mysterious turning point you're at, Virgo, I'm providing you with an extravagant yet cryptic oracle. Read it with the nonlinear side of your brain.] Your escape from the false "home" is imminent. Are you ready to change about 10 percent of your mind about who you really are and 20 percent of your mind about where you truly belong? Regard it as a lucky sign if the prospect of fresh freedom rouses an ancient fear. It means you're close to finding the lost key to the kingdom of childhood, which is also the key to the secret garden of adulthood.

Using probability theory, mathematician J.E. Littlewood calculated that most people typically experience a miracle at a rate of about one per month. In my experience, that estimate is high. I think the average is closer to one miracle every seven weeks. But you Libras can disregard this speculation completely. The astrological omens suggest that the next four weeks will bring you at least four and as many as nine amazing synchronicities, supernatural interventions, and wondrous mysteries.

It's also likely, however, that they will connect you to new resources and help you transcend your limitations. A third possibility is that they will do both: hurt you and heal you. However it all shakes out, Scorpio, you can be sure that your closest relationships are about to teach you lessons you didn't even realize you needed to know.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Laughter Yoga (www.laughteryoga.org) is a new international phenomenon that began in India. Practitioners gather together regularly to engage in half-hour sessions of nonstop chuckling, chortling, and cackling. Yogic breathing exercises supplement the therapeutic value. The month of June will be an ideal time for you Sagittarians to launch local branches of these Laughter Clubs. The astrological omens say you'll be running into an extraordinary number of funny things. That's lucky for you, because you have a lot of accumulated tension to purge, and the best way to do that is by having hilarious experiences.

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Sagittarius? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Your guardian angel is in a feisty mood. I wouldn't be surprised if that not-so-imaginary friend played a trick on you in an attempt to get you to lighten up. Nor would I be shocked if that wise old fool woke you up in the middle of the night to teach you a new freedom song. A kick in the butt isn't out of the question; nor is a tickling sensation in your id or an oddly pleasurable itch in your funny bone. No matter what form they take, Capricorn, I urge you to regard these visits from your secret helper as gifts of inspiration.

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Capricorn? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

The Weekly World News sponsored Wear Your Thong To Work Day last March 26. I didn't tell you about it back then because you just weren't ready for it. This week, though, I can justify advising you to stage your very own Wear Your Thong To Work Day. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you'll have a lot more slack than usual whenever you express the raw, uninhibited, risk-taking sides of your nature. If doing the thong thing isn't the way you'd prefer to cash in on this opportunity, choose something that's a more unique reflection of your daring side. How about an Indulge Your Fantasies Day, or a Be Your Future Self Day?

No one knows you better than you do, Aquarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In the Greek myth, Persephone was abducted by Pluto, god of the underworld. He took her to his domain with the intention of making her his queen. Persephone's mother Demeter pleaded with Zeus to intervene, and he agreed to do so, declaring that as long as Persephone had not eaten any food while in the underworld, she had to be returned to her mother. But by then it was too late: Persephone had already nibbled four pomegranate seeds. Eventually, a compromise was reached: Zeus decreed that Persephone must dwell in Pluto's realm for four months of every year, but could live in the sunlight the rest of the time. The moral of the story, as far as you're concerned, Pisces: Don't eat even one bite of that underworld food.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I almost always urge you to see the glass as half-full, not half-empty. But this week I'm more cautious. Why? Because you may soon be pressured to buy into overly optimistic fantasies. Even people you trust may encourage you to place inflated faith in shaky promises. So ask lots of probing questions, please. Beware of groupthink. On the other hand, however, there's no need to adopt a sour, suspicious perspective. Being cynical will not automatically make you insightful. See if you can manage to be a cheerful skeptic, as generous and open-minded as you are alert for the hype.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

A surfer from California recently collected his 15 minutes of fame when he rode his board for the 10,407th consecutive day. During those 28 years, Dale Webster never took a vacation. To keep his mornings free, he worked exclusively at low-paying night jobs. He surfed on the day his daughter was born and the day he passed kidney stones. His eyes now have scar tissue because he has gazed into the sun for so long, and he's literally afraid to stop surfing for even 24 hours. I nominate him to be both your role model and anti-role model, Taurus. It's a perfect time to commit yourself with fierce passion to a long-term dream, but only if you promise not to let your devotion degenerate into manic obsession.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Taurus. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I lead a group called the Prayer Warriors. We petition God on behalf of people who need help in summoning divine intervention. Here's the prayer we'll be saying for your tribe in the coming months. Dear God: We beseech You to give a big, beautiful home to all Geminis who want one. If they aren't allowed to have that for karmic reasons, please grant them a comfortable apartment with no obnoxious roommates. If You can't manage that, bless them with a trailer that's free of mildew. If that's impossible, bestow on them a tent that doesn't leak and a cheap place to pitch it. If that's too much to ask, let them have their own tree house in a forest that's not too dark and scary. And if all that's out of the question, please at least help them feel at home in the world wherever they are.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Antibiotics have been miracle drugs for over 60 years, but their potency is fading as bacteria evolve to become resistant to them. This has led some British doctors to revive a medieval approach to healing -- placing maggots in open wounds. Seriously. The creepy creatures are fast and effective in cleansing infections. I'd like this to serve as your operative metaphor in the coming weeks, Cancerian. As you strive to mend old psychic lesions, call on the wisdom of the past -- even if it involves a cure that makes you a bit uneasy.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Cancerian? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

The puzzle is not as difficult as you imagine. In fact, it has only seven pieces -- far fewer than you've assumed. Perhaps you got thrown off by its simplicity; it does have a superficial resemblance to a more complicated puzzle from your past. The ironic thing is that you'll never figure it out as long as you're so serious and stressed about it. To create the conditions that will lead to a solution, relax, have as much fun as possible, and assume that the puzzle will soon solve itself.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Leo. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Most American children don't want to grow up to be president any more. The practice of politics is boring and sickening, they tell pollsters. There's too much pressure and too much arguing involved. Despite this trend, I predict that in the coming weeks, a disproportionately large percentage of Virgo youngsters will fantasize about someday becoming President of the United States. I further predict that one of these kids will ultimately be elected Commander in Chief in 2044. As for you Virgo adults, I believe that no matter what country you live in, events in the coming days will awaken your dormant reserves of ambition and authority.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

The time a rodeo cowboy has to stay on a bucking bronco to qualify: 8 seconds. The time a lion-tamer holds his head in a lion's mouth: 7 seconds. The time it takes for a skydiver's parachute to open: 6 seconds. The time it takes for thunder to travel a mile: 5 seconds. The time it will take, sometime in the coming week, for a divine intervention to reveal a galvanizing vision of your possible future: 10 seconds. The time it may take for you to fully understand the meaning of the vision: 4 months.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai wrote that "The soul is a search; the soul is a dance of searches for whatever is lost." Let that be your guiding thought in the coming weeks, Scorpio. The astrological omens suggest that it's high time for you to go looking for a missing treasure. The best way to ensure that you find it is to feed and praise and give free reign to the part of you that you call your soul.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

What kind of archer do you want to be when you grow up, Sagittarius? Would you like to be: 1. the kind of archer who aims in the general direction of several big targets in the distance; 2. the kind who aims at a single medium-sized target in the middle distance; 3. the kind who aims at many small targets that aren't too far away; 4. the kind who never aims at any target at all, but just enjoys the thrill of shooting lots of arrows everywhere? This is a perfect time for you to settle on one of these four options.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

My friend Katherine comes from an old southern family that has recorded its history for generations. She says her great-great-great-grandmother, Elizabeth, was born in Greenville, South Carolina in 1852. Until she was 81 years old, Elizabeth suffered from asthma. Then she was cured completely, and lived free of its ravages until she died in 1955 at the age of 103. I nominate Elizabeth to be your inspirational role model for the next two weeks, Capricorn. Believe it or not, you now have the power to shed a burden or cure a malady that you've always feared was a permanent curse.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Welcome to the Happiness Season, Aquarius. The entire universe is now conspiring to provoke in you an abiding sense of joy and well-being. You can resist, of course; it's your God-given right to use your free will to repel this influx of contentment. But in case you decide to cooperate with the cosmic trend, here are a few helpful thoughts to propel you. "Happiness is a state of going somewhere wholeheartedly, without regret or reservation." - William H. Sheldon. "I'd rather be a failure at something I enjoy than be a success at something I hate." - George Burns. "Happiness is not  attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose." - Helen Keller. "Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy." - Anonymous. "To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of  happiness." - Bertrand Russell.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I predict that some of you overly sensitive Pisceans will soon be beaten down by the cold, cruel world. Maybe you'll move in with your parents or flee to the middle of nowhere and live off the grid in a log cabin. Similarly, more than a few of you Piscean artists, actors, writers, and musicians will get weary of the uphill battle to make a living from doing what you love. You'll think about selling out, seeking dull but secure gigs in the corporate world. But I'm begging all of you not to give up. Please continue your heroic struggles to be true to yourselves. If you can manage to hold on a while longer, you will be blessed with a breakthrough no later than September 1.

No one knows you better than you do, Pisces. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
Wabi-sabi is your guiding principle this week, Aries. It's a Japanese term for a kind of beauty that's imperfect, transitory, and incomplete. In his book Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers, Leonard Koren says wabi-sabi differs from the Western notion that beauty resides in things that are "monumental, spectacular, and enduring." It's about "the minor and the hidden, the tentative and the ephemeral: things so subtle and evanescent they are almost invisible at first glance." Be calmly eager for these small wonders, Aries. Let wabi-sabi be a magic spell that opens up the secret joys concealed within the passing moments of your everyday routine.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

If you've gone to college in the U.S., you've taken the SAT, a standardized test administered to high school students. Is it an accurate measure of intelligence? In a recent analysis, the Princeton Review determined that if the great Taurus writer, William Shakespeare, had submitted his "All the world's a stage" speech for the essay section of the SAT, he would have flunked. Its language is too colorful. I suspect that you, too, may soon be judged or evaluated by one-dimensional minds, Taurus. Don't take it personally. They're simply not able to recognize and accommodate a soul as weighty as yours. Take their off-kilter response as a sign that you need to work harder to situate yourself in environments that fully appreciate you.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I love my regular hikes to the top of idyllic Mohawk Hill. Green hills cascade in every direction. Horses graze in a nearby pasture. Red-tailed hawks soar overhead. But there is one blight: a gray metal storage structure surrounded by barbed-wire fence. At the climax of my ascent today, I rejoiced to find that this monstrosity had been improved. Artistic vandals had paid a visit, covering it with bright graffiti. The yellow, blue, and red designs were mostly indecipherable except for one patch that clearly said "Test Your Strength." That brings me to the point of this week's horoscope, Gemini. Your assignment is to carry out a legal version of what the vandals did: Bring dynamic, interesting disruption to a sterile, ugly scene, thereby testing your strength.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Your symbol for the next four weeks will be the Great Wall of China. Centuries ago, it was a 4,000-mile-long defense system. In that respect, it was an apt metaphor for the formidable barriers you've built around yourself. But the modern version of the Great Wall is only one-third the size it once was, having been reduced over the centuries by people appropriating its stones for new building projects. This reduced state, I hope, is an apt metaphor for the way you'll be dismantling your defense mechanisms between now and June 20.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"I knew that my God was bigger than his," bragged U.S. Army Lt. General William G. Boykin as he derided a Somalian guerrilla leader. "I knew that my God was a real God, and his was an idol." I can't vouch for the accuracy of Boykin's assertion, but I do know this, Leo: According to my analysis of the cosmic omens, your Supreme Being really is stronger, sweeter, and sexier than everyone else's Supreme Beings, at least temporarily. Frankly, your God could kick all the other Gods' asses. I don't advise you to sic Him on anyone, though -- not even on the jerks who seem to deserve it. There'd be hell to pay later if you did. On the other hand, if you and your God show extra mercy and generosity in the coming weeks, you will accrue tremendous karmic credit, which you'll be able to harvest beginning in August.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Can you wait a while to receive your vindication, recognition, and reward? I hope so. If you insist on your prize immediately, it will be unfinished, like a garland made of flowers that were picked before they bloomed. If you're patient, on the other hand, fate will be able to fashion you a riper and more useful blessing. Do you need further motivation, Virgo? Here's some. One of the weak spots in your mastery of the game of life has been a lack of good timing, but lately you've been getting better at sensing the arrival of the perfect moment. Let this growing skill grow a little more.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I don't want to encourage you to be a lazy, crazy, hazy drifter who careens from chance encounter to chance encounter without any specific intention in mind . . . but I do want to invite you to be an adventure-chasing, dream-intoxicated, passion-awakening wanderer who glides from experiment to experiment armed with the goal of opening your mind as far as it can safely go. Head in the direction of the best smells and most intriguing mysteries, Libra.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Your fresh dilemma is actually a twisted old predicament in disguise. It's a bit prettier than it was the last time you saw it, but just as knotty. Please don't underestimate it. If you imagine you can force it to disappear overnight, you'll make bumbling decisions and awkward moves. If, on the other hand, you assume you'll need steady, prolonged effort, you will attract excellent luck and unexpected help. Be a humble warrior motivated not by hatred for the problem but by love for yourself.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Let's talk about repression and suppression. When you repress a difficult feeling or thought, you drive it so deeply into your unconscious mind that you forget about it. In effect, you hide it from yourself out of fear. And yet because this exiled material is of crucial importance, it refuses to remain buried. It ultimately re-emerges in disguise, often as an addiction or obsession, sometimes as an illness. Suppression, on the other hand, is a healthier mechanism. It involves you moving the problematic feeling or thought away from the center of your attention, but remaining aware of it. You're not motivated by fear, but by the intention to deal with the challenge at a time of your choosing. In the coming week, Sagittarius, you'll have to decide between repression and suppression. I hope you'll pick the latter.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Professional handicappers say the odds are a billion-to-1 that any particular person will ultimately achieve sainthood, but a mere 70,000-to-1 that someone will be possessed by Satan. According to my reading of the cosmic signs, however, those figures won't apply to you Capricorns in the coming weeks. I estimate that the odds of you flirting with diabolical forces will be 900 million-to-1, while the odds are 5-to-1 that you will perform services and bestow blessings that qualify you for sainthood. Are you ready to explore the frontiers of ingenious, over-the-top benevolence? Goodness is your superpower.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In his book Weird Ideas That Work, business consultant Robert Sutton advises companies to have as much commitment to creativity as to stability. That's why, in his opinion, they should hire a few free thinkers who enjoy bucking the status quo and are willing to fight for their unique ideas. I think everyone would benefit from heeding that advice; we all need people in our lives who regularly push us to question our assumptions. You Aquarians especially need this influence right now. Do you know any good troublemakers you can call on to get your dogmas disrupted? If not, find one.

It has taken eight centuries, but the Dutch people have added 3,000 square miles to their country. They accomplished this feat not through the conquest of neighboring nations but by building dikes and moving great amounts of water, gradually transforming parts of the sea into livable land. Their dogged effort is a good metaphor for the work I propose for you, Pisces. Think of your unconscious mind as the sea and your conscious mind as the land. Can you imagine what it would entail for you to turn some of those watery depths into solid ground where you can take a stand? Can you imagine the satisfaction of becoming fully aware of feelings and dreams and desires that are now hidden from your view?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Whirl-Zap-Gush (the Supreme Being formerly known as God) has choreographed a rigorous dance for you to do this week. It has a mix of primal and elegant elements; it's both meditative and profanely funny. A good title for this mysterious spectacle might be "Holy Ruckus" or "Sacred Uproar." As always, of course, you have free will: You can refuse to do the dance as Whirl-Zap-Gush has choreographed it, and instead go off and try your own spontaneous improvisations. But for maximum beauty, truth, and fulfillment, I suggest you stick with the divinely designed moves.

It's time to get a new soundtrack for your life. Whatever music has served as your mythic theme all this time just doesn't cut it any more. You need to sing and listen to songs that resonate with the fresh emotional currents that are flowing through you. As you update this primary source of inspiration, I suggest you turn your attention to others as well. Look for a book that can change your life, a role model to inflame your imagination, and a pair of magic underpants.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I'm falling in love with you all over again, Gemini. You've been turning frustration into fuel, and that has impressed me deeply. I'm fascinated by how you've been using your sense of desperation as a good excuse to go crazy in creative and constructive ways. Your inner child and your inner wiseass have been collaborating to pull off unpredictable departures from tradition, and I find that very entertaining. I especially admire the warrior energy you've been bringing to your dreams: how you punched a hole in the nightmare, how you told jokes to the monster, how you risked everything to wake up.

Cancerian singer George Michael recently announced that he intends to give away his music for free, posting it on the Internet for anyone to download. "I've been very well remunerated for my talents over the years," he told BBC, "so I really don't need the public's money." Given the current astrological omens, dear Crab, it makes perfect sense for you to regard Michael as your role model in the coming week. I urge you to expand your generosity to the next level as you provide free samples of a resource or skill you've been blessed with in abundance.

"Emotional Violence for Dummies" was the alternate title Cintra Wilson gave to the film "Mystic River." Writing in Salon.com, she said that while Sean Penn is normally a great actor, the role for which he won his Oscar was overwrought. "I've seen more skillfully calibrated grief at Super Bowl parties," Wilson mused. She speculated that the Academy was "playing catch-up ball," rewarding him for the better work he has done in previous movies. I'm guessing that you will soon have a similar experience, Leo. Like Penn, who was born in the sign of the Lion, you may get more credit or recognition than you seemingly deserve for your current efforts. But it will be well-deserved compensation for the undervalued wonders you pulled off in the past.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

It just ain't natural for a Virgo to be a spectacular exhibitionist. We astrologers might be forgiven, then, if we've wondered how the singer Beyonc√© could possibly be a member of your tribe, as she claims to be. Recently, the mystery was solved. In an interview with the "Star," Beyonc√© revealed that a character named Sasha takes over her body onstage. "There's no way I'd wear a short little dress and dance like that in front of all those people," she said. I bring this up, Virgo, because I'd like you to consider acquiring your own alternate personality. He or she could help you fulfill your current cosmic mandate, which is to climb to a rooftop or mountaintop or tabletop and do a song and dance dedicated to the person you want to be five years from today.

There's a book by Mira Kirshenbaum called Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay: A Step-By-Step Guide to Helping You Decide Whether to Stay in or Get Out of Your Relationship. Her aim is to help her readers "move from painful ambivalence to a clear sense of knowing what to do" about their relationships. I'll be saying a prayer with that theme for you this week, Libra. Whether the relationship in question is with a person or group or job or institution, it's high time for you to be free of swampy vacillation so you can glide into the future with a decisive, free-spirited vision.

These days, Scorpio, you're like a jeweler who doesn't own any jewelry; you're like a TV repair person who never watches TV. The state you're in reminds me of an expert gardener watering the tomato plants when it's raining. You have the aura of a mother without any children or a general whose army is hiding from him. I'm not saying that any of this is a bad thing. It's actually pretty enigmatic and interesting. And for all I know, there may be some method in your madness. Perhaps you're daring fate to give you what you don't know you need.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

The placebo effect is a well-known but little understood phenomenon in medical science. Studies have shown that up to a third of all sick people feel better after receiving pills with no active ingredients. The reason may lie in the body's powerful instinct to participate in its own healing. When it believes help is on the way in the form of medication, it joins in by releasing endorphins, the natural opiates that induce relaxation and a sense of well-being. These thoughts lead me to my analysis of your astrological omens, Sagittarius: I believe that your current ailments, both physical and psychological, are exactly the kind that are most responsive to placebo cures. So load up! M&M;'s are effective, I've found, as are Pez candy and the little white pills contained in toy doctors' kits.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Here's how cartoonist Matt Groening feels about love: "Love is a perky elf dancing a merry little jig and then suddenly he turns on you with a miniature machine gun." Here, on the other hand, is what composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart believed: "Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius." My analysis of the astrological omens leads me to suspect that in the coming weeks your life will be a vivid embodiment of one of those two definitions, Capricorn. Which will win out? The outcome will have nothing to do with blind fate. It'll depend entirely on whether you choose to play romantic games or else devote yourself to the highest form of love you can imagine.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

What if I told you that you can change the past? It's true, Aquarius. You now have power over your memories. It's a perfect moment to adjust them, correct them, and reconfigure them so they will serve you better in the future. You're also in a good position to declare your independence from old images that have been oppressing you. There's no need to feel trapped into being who you used to be if that's not who you are anymore.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Last summer, three exhibitors at the Ohio State Fair tried to fool a panel of judges. The men glued hairpieces on their cows in an effort to hide the animals' sagging backs. But inspectors discovered the bovine toupees and disqualified the cheaters. Now if you Pisceans tried something like this in the coming week, you'd probably get away with it -- at least according to my analysis of the astrological omens. I don't recommend it, though. Ironically, you're far more likely to win competitions or succeed at challenges if you don't engage in subterfuge. Being honest and ethical will give you an unbeatable power you can't tap into any other way.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I suggest you enlist the help of a Jewish Fairy Godmother. If you can't find a good candidate in your own neighborhood, check out the feisty saint at YourJewishFairyGodmother.com. Though I don't know her and can't vouch for her services, I like how she says she "combines a New Age soul with old world wisdom, East Coast savvy and West Coast mellow," and "has black belts in schmoozing, manipulation, and chutzpah." That sounds just right for your current needs, Aries. At this juncture in your noble struggle, you need to be nagged and sweet-talked, prodded and praised. If you get too much tough love or too much tender sympathy, you'll keep missing the point about your problem. But you'll be perfectly motivated if you receive a blend of both.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Welcome to the first horoscope in history that relies entirely on the colors of Crayola crayons for its metaphors. To what do you owe such an honor? Simple, Taurus: After a dicey cruise through the midnight blue and burnt umber parts of the spectrum, you're now awash with a kaleidoscope of flashier hues, ranging from pink flamingo to electric lime to neon carrot. Even wild blue yonder and mango tango are injecting themselves into the mix. Congrats on this vivid redirection. Where you're headed is more interesting than the yellow brick road. In Crayola-speak, it's more like the banana mania brick road.

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Taurus? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Turn your attention, please, to the predicament of Mohabbatsinh Gohil, a diamond trader in India. A cow swallowed 1,722 diamonds that he had accidentally dropped in the street. By combing through the beast's dung for many days, Gohil was eventually able to recover many of his jewels. I suspect that in the coming weeks, Gemini, you'll encounter a challenge comparable to his. Let's hope you've got the patience, humility, and sense of humor to sift through the mounds of drek in search of small but weighty treasure.

No one knows you better than you do, Gemini. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

There's only one bad thing about mountain biking in the windy rain: I have to keep my eyelids half-closed and blink constantly to avoid being blinded. But as long as I'm wearing my waterproof parka, the ride is great fun. Today I swear I heard the wild irises sing with ecstatic gratitude as they soaked up the downpour. The moist blooming humus smell of the earth was intoxicating. The raindrops seemed jubilant as they gathered together into gushing streams and cascaded down the trails. Because no other humans were crazy enough to be out, I got to exult in some precious alone time with the woods. What's the equivalent of mountain biking in the windy rain for you, Cancerian? What tiny annoyances are outweighed by gleeful benefits? You should pursue those experiences passionately this week.

Hungry for more inspiration, Cancerian? Curious about the unfolding mysteries? For more juicy details about your destiny in the coming week, check out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"God is a comedian playing to an audience that is too afraid to laugh," mused eighteenth-century French philosopher Voltaire. What's ironic, I would add, is that the moment you summon the courage to laugh, God's jokes become tonic rather than cruel. They have a cleansing effect, and often tend to break down the obstacles to your dreams. Are you ready to make the transition, Leo? The planetary omens suggest that you have ripened sufficiently to find the next divine punch line hysterically funny.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Leo. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

According to Wordspy.com, the term pareidolia (pronounced "payr-eye-DOH-lee-uh") refers to "the erroneous or fanciful perception of a pattern or meaning in something that is actually ambiguous or random." Mainstream astronomers say this is the perfect word to describe what rogue researchers have called the "Face on Mars," an evocative plateau in the Cydonia region of the red planet. It's important to note, however, that not all wonders and marvels are the result of pareidolia. For instance, the personal message you think you discern in a billboard or tortilla this week may really be a communication directly from an angel of mercy to you. To distinguish authentic breakthroughs from mere pareidolias, strike a balance between skepticism and open-mindedness. Just because some apparent miracles are frauds doesn't mean they all are.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Your role model in the coming weeks is Latin pop star Julio Iglesias, born on the Virgo-Libra cusp. Though he has sold over 150 million records, he admits that there are thousands of people who are more polished vocalists. "I know I can't really sing properly," he told the German magazine Bunte. But he believes it is precisely his lack of perfect technique that makes him so appealing. "My voice has emotion, a style. The best singers can't touch people like I can." If I understand the astrological portents correctly, Libra, you're most likely to succeed in the coming days if you use Iglesias' approach in your own field of endeavor. Don't let an obsession with flawless execution get in the way of expressing genuine feeling. Emphasize magic over cleverness.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Imagine it's 30 years from today. You're looking back at the history of your relationship with desire. You realize that the period of April through August of 2004 stands out as a watershed. That was when you clearly saw that some of your desires were mediocre, inferior, and wasteful, while others were beautiful, sacred, and invigorating. Beginning then, you made it one of your life goals to purge the former and cultivate the latter. Thereafter, you occasionally wandered down dead ends pursuing goals that weren't worthy of you, but usually you wielded your passions with discrimination and integrity, dedicating them to serve the highest and most interesting good. Right?

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Scorpio. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Don't camp next to a forest fire or go on a picnic where mad bulls roam. OK, Sagittarius? Don't play with matches next to a gasoline pump, either, or fly a kite in a lightning storm, or feed steroids to the monsters under your bed. In fact, I suggest that you take fewer risks than you normally might. Whenever you feel a surge of daredevil energy, turn it inward and direct it at the mental blocks that have been messing with your creativity.

Want more clues, Sagittarius? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

It's an astrologically favorable time to expand your repertoire of pleasurable activities. The hidden forces of fate will bring you luck and synchronicity when you set aside your familiar old amusements and experiment with fresh ones. For example, whatever your favorite sexual positions or techniques are, you should consider retiring them for a couple of weeks while you branch out. Same with desserts, intoxicants, games, and getaways: Try anything different at least once. Drink some of that new chocolate beer. Get stroked by two massage therapists simultaneously. Schedule a singing lesson on a mountaintop or a flying lesson in your dreams.

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Capricorn? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Is there anything more dangerous than getting up in the morning and having nothing to worry about, no problems to solve, no friction to heat you up? That state can be a threat to your health, because if untreated it incites an unconscious yearning for any old dumb trouble that might generate some excitement. I'm concerned that you might fall into this trap in the coming week, Aquarius. To ensure that you don't, go hunt down some useful and fascinating trouble as soon as possible.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Aquarius? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Late last year, the dj Danger Mouse made a record that blended vocals from rap star Jay-Z's "Black Album" with instrumental tracks lifted from the Beatles "White Album." The result, which he called the "Grey Album," was praised by Rolling Stone as "the ultimate remix record" and "an ingenious hip-hop record that sounds oddly ahead of its time." Your assignment in the coming weeks, Pisces, is to join together seemingly unrelated elements to create a combination that's as interesting and innovative as Danger Mouse's. There's one way I hope your effort will be different from his, however. Because he didn't have authorization to use the Beatles' material, the "Grey Album" can never be commercially released. Your work, on the other hand, should be legal, kosher, and karmically impeccable.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In Montgomery, Alabama there is an intersection where Jefferson Davis Avenue meets Rosa Parks Avenue. The first street is named after the president of the secessionist slave-owning states in America's Civil War. The other is named in honor of the black woman whose brave actions in 1954 helped launch the civil rights movement. I'd like to suggest that this place is a good symbol for the crossroads where you now stand, Aries. Why? Meditate on these two possibilities. 1. The controlling, dogmatic rebel in you has come head-to-head with the flexible, freedom-loving rebel in you. 2. The loud, bellicose fighter in you is in a struggle with the poised, strategic fighter in you.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Close your eyes and take yourself back in time to the moment when you slipped free of your mother's womb. Imagine your original breath; recreate the sensation of air rushing into your lungs for the first time. Remember it as the end of your warm, dark, watery existence and the beginning of your sojourn in this bright, dry, spacious world. Dwell there in that simulation for a while, Taurus, then consider this: You will soon experience, in a metaphorical way and on a higher level, another first breath. Like the earlier version, it will be both unsettling and vivifying, a time of poignancy and celebration.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Years ago, rock star Sting bragged about the extravagant tantric lovemaking that he and his wife enjoyed. Their erotic sessions sometimes lasted for eight consecutive hours, he said. But recently he confessed that his earlier claims had been overstated. "What I didn't say about the eight-hour marathons," he told British TV station ITV, "was that they included four hours of begging and then dinner and a movie." I urge you to regard Sting as your role model in the coming week, Gemini. Spend some time making good-humored corrections of your past hyperbole. While you're at it, atone for any other extreme or immoderate behavior that may still be generating misconceptions.

Though he wrote almost five centuries ago, comic novelist Francois Rabelais provided the perfect advice for you this week: "It behooves all adventurers to treat their good luck with reverence, neither bothering nor upsetting it." In other words, Cancerian, don't spend even a minute wondering why your life is blessed with so much grace right now. Refrain from analyzing it, discoursing about it, or theorizing on how you might be able to preserve it. Instead, use it exuberantly and with a devout sense of gratitude. Explore in vivid detail what it feels like to be a free-wheeling adventurer.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Now that you're in the ambition-building phase of your yearly cycle, I figure you're ready for a fresh set of cute aphorisms. Use the following to fuel the fire in your belly, the chutzpah in your heart, and the gleam in your eye. 1. If you don't run your own life, someone else will. 2. Opportunity often slips by unrecognized, disguised as hard work. 3. Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself. 4. Be willing to give up what you are for what you can become. 5. Follow your dreams, except the one where you're giving a speech in your underwear.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The influential New York Times Book Review may soon begin to emphasize nonfiction books and cut back on its coverage of literary fiction. "The most compelling ideas tend to be in the nonfiction world," Times executive editor Bill Keller said in an interview, launching the rumors. Poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti decried such a move, telling the San Francisco Chronicle's Heidi Benson that "the national consciousness has [already] been taken over by the technological and pragmatic." He'd like to see more fiction and poetry. Regardless of where you might stand on this issue for the long haul, Virgo, it's important to side with Ferlinghetti for now. You need less knowledge and more imagination, fewer of the hard facts and more of the dreamy truths.

U.S. President Woodrow Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke in 1919. For the next 17 months, until his term was over, his wife Edith was the de facto Commander in Chief of the United States. She hid the severity of his incapacity, allowing only his doctors to see him as he hid in his sickroom at the White House. Meanwhile, she issued a steady stream of policy decisions, signed treaties, and presidential directives, always written in her own hand. I believe you Libras now have a chance to play a role comparable to Edith's: to be the power behind the throne. Here are your words to live by, courtesy of philanthropist Art Rennison: "There is no end to what can be accomplished if you don't care who gets the credit."

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Just because you're born under a particular sign doesn't mean you're forever obligated to be a perfect example of all its classical qualities. On the contrary, a growing number of visionary astrologers recommend regular rebellions against your type. To do so keeps you honest; it prevents you from being consumed by habit. The coming weeks will be an especially favorable time for you to periodically elude the Scorpio trance. It almost doesn't matter which alternatives you experiment with, but I believe you'll gain a lot by trying on Libran and Aquarian perspectives.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Forty years ago, three repetitions of a 60-second TV commercial were enough to reach 80 percent of the population. Today it takes 117 such plugs to accomplish the same effect. Why? The proliferation of cable TV stations and other media means that a business has to work much harder to spread the word about its product. You'll face a similar prospect in the coming weeks and months, Sagittarius. Because your competition will be expanding and multiplying, you'll have to grow in order to keep from falling behind. I think that's good news, though. The pressure to improve will be healthy for you.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Desire makes everything blossom," mused French novelist Marcel Proust. "Possession makes everything wither and fade." If the first part of that quote is true, Capricorn, you'll be in full bloom any minute now. The astrological omens suggest that your longings will explode with the forceful beauty of five dozen long-stemmed red roses arrayed in a spiral on a silk-covered bed. But what about the second half of Proust's quote? Will you feel withered and faded once you have possessed what you desire? Not if you're a student of cycles; not if you're one of those wise, highly evolved Capricorns who's as skilled at having as you are at wanting.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

I won't be upset with you if you decide to buy a case of gourmet chocolate, have your bathroom floor redone in a style resembling the throne room of a seventeenth-century French king, or get cosmetic surgery on your least-favorite physical feature. The astrological omens suggest that you have every right to splurge in order to make yourself feel really good. However, there are less materialistic, more soul-satisfying ways to channel your mandate for lavish self-fulfillment. Consider the possibility of hiring a coach or going on a meditation retreat, for instance. Revamp your diet so it's twice as healthy as it is now, or find a way to release the natural endorphins in your brain on a more regular basis.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Have you ever gone to a film merely looking for lightweight diversion, but instead you get bowled over by a moving scene that inspires you to change your life for the better? Have you ever sought out a friend in the hope of receiving unconditional approval, but she gently points out a flaw in your thinking that helps you shed a pernicious delusion? Fate will offer you life-enhancing substitutions like these in the coming week, Pisces. Don't be fanatically attached to fulfilling your expectations.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Don't try to rob a bank this week, Aries. The astrological omens indicate you'd have a very low chance at succeeding, and besides, it's wrong. I also discourage you from buying hundreds of lottery tickets, selling your childhood collection of Barbie dolls or baseball cards, or wheedling your aging relatives into giving you your inheritance before they die. The cosmic forces are showing signs of coalescing in a way that will bring you financial gain. But in my opinion they'll only do so if you sit down and plot out a sensible, disciplined, ethical master plan.

Your most important accomplishment this year has been a deepening of your capacity for love. That alone should inspire you to leap up in the air and sing a song of joy. More and more you understand that in order to get the passionate affection you want, you simply have to give the passionate affection you want. If you continue to expand your generosity in the coming months, Taurus, you will receive a flood of evidence about how beautiful you really are. That, in turn, will ensure that the influences you want to bring into your life will also be good for you.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

It's molting time, Gemini. If you were a bird, you'd lose your worn-out feathers and sprout a fresh batch. If you were a snake, you'd shed your old skin to make way for the new. If you were a lobster, you'd slough off your exoskeleton because it was constraining your ability to grow, then replace it with a bigger version. So what's your personal version of molting? Maybe some aspect of your persona needs to be cast off. Or maybe some armor that previously shielded you has begun to cramp your style. It won't happen overnight, and you'll feel vulnerable during the transition. But the process is perfectly normal; indeed, it's essential for your health.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The DuPont company has patents on 17 varieties of corn. Yoga teacher Bikram Choudhury has copyrighted and trademarked his poses and breathing techniques. Corporations are acquiring private ownership of fresh water that once belonged to local communities. McDonald's virtually owns the prefix "Mc," and sues new businesses with names that begin with those two letters. In the entrepreneurial spirit of these big thinkers, and by the authority of the planetary gods, I hereby present you Cancerians with full possession of the Dionysian spirit, good for the next four weeks. Now go party harder and smarter than you've ever dared.

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Cancerian? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Artist and filmmaker Andy Warhol was, like you, born under the sign of Leo. One of his goals in life was to blur the distinction between fine art and pop culture. The fact that his paintings of Campbell's soup cans hang in prestigious museums proves he succeeded. My analysis of the astrological omens suggests that you'd be wise to imitate his method this week. In whatever way is most fun for you, bring high and low together; blend what's sophisticated and casual; do experiments that synthesize the sublime and the ordinary.

No one knows you better than you do, Leo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

You have two options to choose from, Virgo. The contrast between them reminds me of the difference between two singers, Norah Jones and Ani DiFranco. Jones's work is "tasteful and listenable," said the New York Times, though "Nothing much happens in her songs." ShakingThrough.net wrote that though Jones can be maudlin and subdued, she creates "a winning collection of polished (albeit innocuous) gems." About Ani DiFranco, the New York Times noted that "It's worth putting up with a few overbearing moments to hear someone so willing to take chances." Billboard said DiFranco's latest CD is "raw --  for better (the immediacy of the performance) and worse (traces of off-key harmonies)." So which way will you go, Virgo: bland and classy like Jones, or rough and stimulating like DiFranco?

Libra (September 23-October 22)

It's time to rise up and fight back, Libra. Maybe there used to be semi-good reasons for you to endure the abuse, but they have become irrelevant. Draw inspiration from the Brazilian crowds that beat up the sharks that were stalking swimmers at a Rio de Janeiro beach. Be as fierce as the Philadelphia schoolgirls who pursued and pummeled the pervert who'd been exposing himself to them.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Libra. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Back in 1987, my life in Santa Cruz was carefree. I loved being an unemployed bohemian with lots of leisure time to write poetry and play music. One summer day, while working on a new song, I heard my doorbell ring. Opening the door, I found a man in a hooded trench coat aiming a slingshot at me. As my knees collapsed and my heart raced, he lowered the slingshot, removed his hood, and chuckled, "Made you flinch!" It was my Scorpio pal, Fred, the poet who loved to play practical jokes to keep his friends on their toes. He said he couldn't stay -- had just come by to make sure I wasn't getting too comfortable. When he left, I went into a creative frenzy and wrote three songs in an hour. In the coming week, I foresee you encountering a milder version of Fred's style of inspiration, which will unleash a similar burst of productive energy.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

It's time to update that pessimistic set of formulas known as Murphy's Laws. In the old version, the rule was: "If anything can go wrong, it will." The new, improved version, which you will soon exemplify, is "If anything can go wrong, it will, but in correcting it you will stumble upon a lucky break you wouldn't have encountered otherwise." Here are other Murphy's Laws to revise, Sagittarius. Old version: "Everything takes longer than you think." New version: "Everything takes longer than you think, which is a good thing, because if it took only as long as you thought, you wouldn't be doing it right." Old version: "You will always find something in the last place you look." New version: "You will often find something in the last place you look, but along the way you'll discover a valuable item you didn't realize was missing."

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Sagittarius? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

If you're average, 90 industrial compounds and pollutants are circulating through your body. You also have the residues of 20 million advertisements and 200,000 televised acts of violence stored in your brain. That's the bad news, Capricorn. The good news is that you'll soon have an abundance of experiences that are highly effective at neutralizing toxins. I'm referring to encounters with play, delight, and love. Rejoice in the fact that every time you grin, giggle, or chuckle in the coming weeks, you'll purge a nasty influence that had been sapping your energy. A single belly laugh could flush out 50,000 commercials.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Capricorn. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

John Goldhammer is a psychotherapist who specializes in working with patients' dreams. Over the course of 25 years, he has concluded that there is one sure way to free yourself from a recurring nightmare: Stop running away from the monster that's chasing you. The moment you're able to change your behavior in the dream -- to turn and face the monster, maybe even embrace it or give it a gift -- the haunting will end; you'll never have the nightmare again. I'd like you to apply this approach in your waking life, Aquarius: Turn and face the uncomfortable truth that's plaguing you. Maybe even express your love and gratitude for it.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Geminis often get credited with being the most versatile sign of the zodiac, but you Pisceans are strong competitors for the title. These days, in fact, your patron saint is the recently deceased George Plimpton. That chameleon-like bon vivant, who had four planets in Pisces, was not only a writer. He also performed as a circus trapeze artist and stand-up comedian, played percussion in a symphony, drove racecars, acted in movies and TV, and competed in exhibition games with professional boxers and football players. Are you ready to claim more of your astrological potential with a Plimpton-like exuberance?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Due to a confluence of unusual astrological influences, you've been temporarily authorized to act as if you are the love child of comedians Chris Rock and Margaret Cho. Here's some of the behavior you have a cosmic license to express: 1. Expose hypocrisy with uproarious honesty. 2. Lay yourself bare as a way to educate and inspire others. 3. Shock people awake with irreverent new spins on traditional subjects. 4. Risk being annoying in order to be a servant of the hilarious truth. 5. Be edgy and healing, disruptive and inspiring, half-crazy and profoundly real.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In my opinion, you're perfect just the way you are. Everything about your life is exactly how it should be. You're right on schedule to fulfill the mission you came to earth to carry out. The paradoxical thing is, though, that you can become even more perfect, and make your life even more completely what it could be, and expedite your progress in accomplishing the mission you came to earth to carry out. This week is an ideal time to understand how these seemingly contradictory truths can co-exist.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Taurus? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.
Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Have you guessed that 2004 is the best year ever to coordinate the parts of your life that have always worked at cross-purposes? Do you realize how much power you now have to unify opposites? Please intensify your efforts to strike a dynamic balance between the impulses of your mind and the yearnings of your heart. Raise your expectations as you strive to create a more perfect blend of freedom and commitment. Summon an almost extreme faith in your ability to be both a charismatic star and a cooperative team player.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The editors of the Old Farmer's Almanac have proposed a new generation of superstitions. Never sing in bed, they warn, or wear just one shoe. Avoid putting the wrong key in a lock, and never lay a broom on a bed. The doomsayers of the mainstream media do the same thing as the Old Farmer's Almanac all the time, of course. They drum up an ever-fresh supply of reasons why you should walk around paranoid, although they pretend their scary fantasies are more real than those of the Almanac. My feeling, Cancerian, is that it's a perfect time for you to rebel against every kind of compulsive fright-mongering, whether it originates with the professional perpetrators of mass anxiety or in the depths of your own unconscious. To get started, sing in bed while lying next to a broom and wearing one shoe. 

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Cancerian? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.
Leo (July 23-August 22)

According to the New York Daily News, Leo novelist Danielle Steel had a tailor embroider the word "bitch" on 16 pairs of her socks. I suggest you do the same. If that's too extreme or time-consuming, write "hard core" on your ankle with a felt-tip marker. If that would sully your dignity, at least imagine that you have a tattoo on the sole of your foot that says "wise-guy" or "riot grrrl." The point is not to send a tough message to the general public, but to make a secret pact with yourself. No one else but you needs to know that you're planning to become better grounded and more fiercely assertive.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

It's time for a check-in, Virgo. What progress have you been making in your work on this year's big opportunities? As I suggested last December, you'll attract unexpected help in 2004 by growing the parts of your life that are small and timid and immature. Likewise, you'll generate good luck any time you enlarge your sphere of influence and energize your ambitions. Thirdly, you'll feel more and more at home in the world if you aggressively seek out interesting responsibilities that liberate you from your old images of yourself. My sense is that you've been doing OK in all these tasks, but there's room for improvement. The coming weeks are the perfect time to kick your efforts into high gear.

No one knows you better than you do, Virgo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.
Libra (September 23-October 22)

The moment is ripe to initiate shifts in the way you create your closest relationships. For starters, I suggest you change the words you habitually use to deal with this part of your life. "Relationship," for instance, is a crashingly dull term for something so interesting. Try "hookup" or "two-way" instead. And rather than referring to someone as your "friend" or "partner," call him or her your "accomplice," your "freestyle," or your "lightning." Dead terms like "significant other," "boyfriend," "girlfriend," and "spouse" should be forever banished as well. In their places, try "lushbuddy," "heartbeat," or "jelly roll." Feel free, of course, to dream up your own fresh slang.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

After you damage a fingernail, it grows faster than when it's in its normal state. Scientists have proved this, though they don't understand why it happens. I have observed that a similar phenomenon often occurs in people who have experienced a psychic wound. They ripen emotionally with amazing speed, blasting through inner obstacles that had kept them enslaved to the past. I predict that you will soon begin responding in this way to your recent hurt.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Let's take stock of the progress you've made since January 1. Most strikingly, you've been more disciplined in your quest for freedom and more discriminating about expressing your generosity. That's very good news. In past years, your drive for freedom has sometimes been chaotic, causing you to overestimate your strength; your generosity has often been excessive, leading you to promise too much. The fact that you're now reining in these two tendencies is a sign that you're finally poised to claim a measure of sovereignty you've never been ready for before.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

You may find this hard to believe, but it's very important for you to decide what actor or actress you'd choose to play you in the hypothetical movie based on your life. For me, it's obviously Viggo Mortensen, though if he weren't available I'd probably accept Robin Williams or Snoop Dogg. But then I can afford to indulge in the luxury of indecision about this matter, whereas you really can't. For reasons you can't imagine -- reasons that have to do with you taking your life's work more seriously than ever before -- you must expand and deepen the mythic intensity of your life story.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Please try to be a little more boring this week, Aquarius. The swarming melodrama you call your life has become waaaayyyy too interesting. You've got more superheated plots and subplots going on than a Mexican soap opera. People are spreading such extremely entertaining gossip about you that you may be hard-pressed to live up to your growing reputation. Having said all that, however, I want to emphasize that I'm only asking you to turn down the excitement level one notch, and no more. You just need to shift from outrageous pandemonium to wild intrigue.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Aquarius. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.
Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Scientists believe that objectivity and intellectual curiosity are the two attitudes most crucial to understanding how the world works. The nineteenth-century Scottish essayist, Thomas Carlyle, had a different emphasis. "A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge," he wrote. Kabbalistic teacher Ann Davies agreed, saying that in order to truly see a person, you have to connect with his or her inner essence through loving empathy. Regardless of which style of learning you're naturally inclined to, Pisces, I suggest you use both aggressively in the coming weeks. You have an unprecedented opportunity to grow both smarter and wiser. The best way to take advantage is to be inquisitive, unbiased, and profoundly compassionate.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If forced to decide between having a bigger penis and living in a world where there was no war, 90 percent of men would pick universal peace. So says a poll conducted by Glamour magazine and MensHealth.com. I predict that fate will soon ask you, Aries, to choose between two possibilities that also seem to represent a showdown between self-aggrandizement and altruism. If you play your wild cards, right, however, you may not have to pick one at the expense of the other. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you can have both.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"We are attracted to people who express the qualities we deny or repress in ourselves," says creativity expert Shakti Gawain. Using this idea as your hypothesis, Taurus, take an inventory of the people you're most drawn to. Ask yourself whether they have talents and dreams that you secretly wish could come fully alive in you. If you find this to be the case, consider the possibility that it's time to transform your secret wishes into definite plans.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Seeing as how you're at the peak of your popularity and in the harvest phase of your yearly cycle, why not suggest to your friends that they organize a celebration in your honor? A parade could launch the festivities, with you riding in a red Cadillac convertible followed by floats depicting the turning points in your life. When you arrive at the banquet hall, you'll be carried on a litter to a throne. You'll eat a gourmet dinner featuring your favorite food while a series of allies comes to the microphone to describe what they like most about you. To conclude the party, a band will play a set of songs written especially for you. These are merely suggestions, Gemini. You may have different ideas about how you'd like to be glorified. Just make sure you communicate them clearly to the proper people.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I'm a direct descendant of Genghis Khan (1162-1227), the Mongol leader who controlled an empire stretching from Hungary to Korea. The funny thing is, you might be one of his progeny, too. Geneticists have determined that there are millions of us worldwide, owing to our forefather's prolific sowing of wild oats over an extensive area. Of course it's natural if we have mixed feelings about him: He and his troops did all the nasty things a conquering army usually does. But he was also a good manager who codified laws, advanced religious freedom, and promoted ethnic diversity. Even if Khan isn't officially your ancestor, Cancerian, you're now primed to imitate his more enlightened side. As you expand your territory and authority, fantasize about the ways your new clout will allow you to give greater gifts.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I never take drugs. If I were a Leo, however, I might travel to Britain this week and smoke some pot. (Possession of the stuff in small amounts is no longer illegal there.) If that's impossible for you, find other ways to gently blow your mind. Go on a three-day meditation retreat, make love for six consecutive hours, and read the poetry of Mary Oliver while swinging on a swing. Or make atonement to a person you once wronged, assume that everything you think you know is only half-right, and give away money to someone in need. Or all of the above.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The Indian activist Gandhi lead many peaceful rebellions against oppressive governments, first in South Africa and later in British-controlled India. At first he called his strategy "passive resistance," but later disavowed that term because it had negative implications. He ultimately chose the Sanskrit word satyagraha, meaning "love force" or "truth force." "Truth ('satya') implies love," he said, "and firmness ('agraha') is a synonym for force. 'Satyagraha' is thus the force which is born of truth and love." According to my reading of the astrological omens, Virgo, satyagraha should be your word of power in the coming weeks. Your uprising against the forces of darkness has got to do more than say "no." A fierce, primal YES should be at the heart of your crusade.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

By 2005, you'll be enrolled in a new School of Life, beginning a fresh course of study that will delight the innocent, open-hearted kid in you. But much of 2004 will be like taking a long final exam based on material you've studied forever. On some days the test questions may bore you into a stupor, while on other days they may electrify you into a state of red alert. Here's a clue that could help you keep those extreme states to a minimum in the coming months, as well as ensure that you'll ace the exam: Leave your normal routine and get away from it all as often as is practical. While you wander in the great unknown, you're likely to attract the exact experiences you'll need to solve the toughest riddles.

No one knows you better than you do, Libra. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Let's do a check-in, Scorpio. What progress have you been making in your work on this year's biggest opportunity? As I suggested last December, 2004 will be an excellent time to build the kind of network you've always wanted. New alliances will be yours for the asking. Existing collaborators will be extra receptive to deepening your connections. You'll tend to get lucky whenever you try to interest people in helping you express your talents for the good of all. If you've been lagging behind in cashing in on this trend, step up your efforts immediately. You now have the power to make up for lost time.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

April is Feedback Month. In the coming weeks, everyone from your best friend to the janitor at work may barrage you with hints of what they think about you. A few of the reports will be fairly accurate representations of you, while others may resemble the reflections you get from funhouse mirrors. If you just relax your ego muscles and watch the mad rush of images as you would a comic movie, however, the overall experience will be rejuvenating.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Free will is there for the taking, like wild blueberries," writes poet Ellen Dor√© Watson, "-- a trifle more sour than we remember." In other words, Capricorn, your mouth might pucker and your eyes may squint when you first sample the ripe crop of free will that you'll come upon this week. But once you've experienced the sensation for a while, it'll start tasting sweeter. By this time next week, you'll be amazed at how delicious it is.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In my astrological opinion, you now have a sacred duty to cause good trouble. Please carry out at least two kinds of benevolent mischief from the following list. 1. Break taboos that serve no useful purpose. 2. Circumvent rules that are rotten or harmful. 3. Expose the manipulators who are trying to get everyone to buy into their delusions. 4. Trick people into rebelling against influences that are bad for them. 5. If you see friends or loved ones who are running on autopilot, give them lessons on how to wake up.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Piscean actress Mercedes Ruehl won the Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the 1991 movie, "The Fisher King." Taking the stage at the awards ceremony, she exclaimed, "I shall never waitress again, and you are my witnesses!" She was almost 43 years old at the time. I foresee a comparable breakthrough for you in the coming months, Pisces. It may not be quite as dramatic as Ruehl's, but it will definitely free you forever from a task that has stifled or demeaned your spirit. And you can lay the groundwork for this victory now.

On some days the test questions may bore you into a stupor, while on other days they may electrify you into a state of red alert. Here's a clue that could help you keep those extreme states to a minimum in the coming months, as well as ensure that you'll ace the exam: Leave your normal routine and get away from it all as often as is practical. While you wander in the great unknown, you're likely to attract the exact experiences you'll need to solve the toughest riddles.

No one knows you better than you do, Libra. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Let's do a check-in, Scorpio. What progress have you been making in your work on this year's biggest opportunity? As I suggested last December, 2004 will be an excellent time to build the kind of network you've always wanted. New alliances will be yours for the asking. Existing collaborators will be extra receptive to deepening your connections. You'll tend to get lucky whenever you try to interest people in helping you express your talents for the good of all. If you've been lagging behind in cashing in on this trend, step up your efforts immediately. You now have the power to make up for lost time.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

April is Feedback Month. In the coming weeks, everyone from your best friend to the janitor at work may barrage you with hints of what they think about you. A few of the reports will be fairly accurate representations of you, while others may resemble the reflections you get from funhouse mirrors. If you just relax your ego muscles and watch the mad rush of images as you would a comic movie, however, the overall experience will be rejuvenating.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Sagittarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Free will is there for the taking, like wild blueberries," writes poet Ellen Dor√© Watson, "-- a trifle more sour than we remember." In other words, Capricorn, your mouth might pucker and your eyes may squint when you first sample the ripe crop of free will that you'll come upon this week. But once you've experienced the sensation for a while, it'll start tasting sweeter. By this time next week, you'll be amazed at how delicious it is.

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Capricorn? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In my astrological opinion, you now have a sacred duty to cause good trouble. Please carry out at least two kinds of benevolent mischief from the following list. 1. Break taboos that serve no useful purpose. 2. Circumvent rules that are rotten or harmful. 3. Expose the manipulators who are trying to get everyone to buy into their delusions. 4. Trick people into rebelling against influences that are bad for them. 5. If you see friends or loved ones who are running on autopilot, give them lessons on how to wake up.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Aquarius? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Piscean actress Mercedes Ruehl won the Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the 1991 movie, "The Fisher King." Taking the stage at the awards ceremony, she exclaimed, "I shall never waitress again, and you are my witnesses!" She was almost 43 years old at the time. I foresee a comparable breakthrough for you in the coming months, Pisces. It may not be quite as dramatic as Ruehl's, but it will definitely free you forever from a task that has stifled or demeaned your spirit. And you can lay the groundwork for this victory now.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Pisces. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Aries statesman Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in a mere 18 days. You should make him your role model as you devote the next three weeks to producing a masterpiece that will be regarded by posterity as one of history's great accomplishments. APRIL FOOL! I was exaggerating a little, Aries. It's true that you now have enormous creative power, and you could very well lay the groundwork for what will ultimately be a tour de force. But you may not be able to whip it out in three weeks, and it may not have quite the star quality of Jefferson's classic.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In the coming week, your dreams will be more interesting and important than anything that happens during the day. Your sleeping mind can solve all your problems if given enough time -- and maybe even the problems of those you love, too. Can you afford to stay in bed for 12 hours at a stretch? APRIL FOOL! Twelve hours might be a bit much. But everything else I said was true. You have the potential to be a dreaming genius.

Want more clues, Taurus? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Visualize a scenario in which Israelis and Palestinians are still embroiled in a hateful state of siege for another 100 years. Imagine that the personal problems bugging you now will continue to torment you indefinitely. Live your life as if you believe the world is falling apart and that we human beings are parasites bent on wrecking the paradise we've been blessed with. APRIL FOOL! Don't you dare indulge in any of the hackneyed cynicism I just spouted. While educated idiots might try to convince you that badmouthing the future is honest and intelligent, it's actually a bad habit based on delusion. Here's your real assignment, Gemini: Retrain your mind to expect the best. Visualize in graphic detail the transformations you'd love to see. Cultivate delight using all your ingenuity.

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Gemini? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Add more locks to your doors and more armor to your defense mechanisms. Transform your home into an impregnable fortress of solitude and don't go out unless you absolutely have to. You must make yourself perfectly safe! APRIL FOOL! It probably makes sense to be more discriminating about whom you share your feelings with, but in general it's an excellent time to open your heart and turn your home into a festive center of abundance. I suggest you invite every interesting person you trust to come and experience you in your natural habitat.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Cancerian? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

This just in: It is possible to buy happiness. In fact, researchers at Yahoo! Personal Finance have determined the precise amount necessary: $4.9 million. With that sum in your bank account, you could acquire the lifestyle that would fulfill your dreams and make you feel really good. Now here's the crazy part, Leo: The chances are far better than usual that you'll win the lottery this week, thereby guaranteeing your eternal happiness. APRIL FOOL! While you Leos do have extraordinary financial luck these days, there just aren't enough lotteries in the world to ensure that every one of you will win one.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Your role model these days should be the vulgar, debauched writer Charles Bukowski. He was poor most of his life as he worked endless odd jobs, but he managed to publish 50 books with titles like Love Is a Dog from Hell and Play the Piano Drunk Like a Percussion Instrument Until the Fingers Begin to Bleed a Bit. Here's one of his typically inspired passages: "It's not easy to juggle a full-time job, a pregnant wife, and a troubled child, but somehow I still managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day." Be like Bukowski this week, Virgo. APRIL FOOL! I was just messin' with you, Dog! I don't really want you to be like Bukowski. But I had you going there for a minute, didn't I? And that's good, because every now and then -- like right now -- it's damn healthy for you to fantasize that you're a vulgar, debauched writer.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Does your roommate have some ripe plums in the refrigerator that you're dying to devour? Go right ahead. In the spot where the plums were, leave this poem by William Carlos Williams: "I have eaten/ the plums/ that were in/ the icebox// and which/ you were probably/ saving/ for breakfast// Forgive me/ they were delicious/ so sweet/ and so cold". APRIL FOOL! While you do have astrological permission to be grabbier and greedier and more impulsive than usual, you can easily do that without generating any bad karma. Don't steal the plums.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

It's not enough to do good deeds this week. You should also be intent on getting handsomely repaid for your good deeds. In other words, Scorpio, generosity will be a brilliant strategy if it manipulates others into being generous to you. Give selfishly, or don't give at all. APRIL FOOL! The truth is that you should bestow blessings everywhere you go, but with absolutely no strings attached. Here are your words to live by, courtesy of the Dalai Lama: "Try with all your might -- work very, very hard -- to make the world a better place. But if all your efforts are to no avail -- no hard feelings!"

No one knows you better than you do, Scorpio. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Everyone in the world is either a narcissist or a closet narcissist. Ironically, it's those in the latter group who're more dangerous. Their self-obsession expresses in covert ways that are hard to track. That's one reason why you should be unapologetically blatant about expressing your superiority this week, Sagittarius. The second reason is that the astrological omens suggest you have a mandate to be a raging megalomaniac. APRIL FOOL! I went overboard there, although not by a whole lot. Let's just say that between now and April 18 you have cosmic permission to love yourself even more than usual and break your all-time bragging records.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

My reader-satisfaction level is high. The weekly audience for this horoscope column is about nine million people, but I get an average of only 40 complaints a year. Maybe it's because you Capricorns are so forceful in sticking up for your needs, but a disproportionate number of the beefs I receive are from your tribe. That's why I've decided to never again utter a discouraging word in your presence. Forevermore, your horoscope will contain nothing but praise and good news. APRIL FOOL! I love you, Capricorn! And it wouldn't be very loving to refrain from kicking your butt on those rare occasions when you need it. Like now, for instance: I demand that you demand higher standards from you and your inner circle.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Capricorn. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

A swimming coach in Darwin, Australia decided that his young swimmers lacked ambition. They were consistently mediocre in competition, with no apparent drive for peak performances. Hoping to rouse their primal instinct to swim faster, he proposed to have them practice with a ten-foot crocodile in the pool. I wish you Aquarians would consider being equally daring as you ratchet up your motivation levels in the coming weeks. APRIL FOOL! Scaring yourself is a terrible strategy. But I do think you should take a more aggressive approach to stimulating your drive for excellence.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Quit your job immediately. Move out of your house. Break off your closest relationships. Give away all your clothes to charity and sell your car at less than market value. If you do these things, I guarantee that within six weeks you will get an easy job where everyone loves you and you get paid way too much money to have way too much fun. APRIL FOOL! I was just testing you to see how susceptible you are to being manipulated by experts you trust. The fact is, Pisces, if you turn down the volume of the authority figures who drone on in your head -- both those who bent your thoughts in the past and those who shape your destiny in the present -- your financial situation and your job satisfaction will markedly improve.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For months now, you've been cultivating a more mature relationship with obstacles. You've begun to see them less as punishments doled out by an unfair universe and more as interesting, growth-inducing challenges provided by a generous universe. If you do nothing else but master this perspective in the next eight months, I'll declare 2004 a success. Are you ready for the next big breakthrough in your noble struggle to refine how you struggle?

"Bolivia has no ocean, but it has admirals done up like Lord Nelson," writes Eduardo Galeano in The Book of Embraces. "Lima, Peru has no rain, but it has peaked roofs with gutters. In Managua, Nicaragua, one of the hottest cities in the world, there are mansions flaunting magnificent fireplaces." Are there any anomalies like these in your world, Taurus? Do you have tools for jobs you never do? Luxuries you don't use? Elaborate structures that have no purpose? If so, it's time to either rethink your relationship to them or else phase them out.

You will soon come across numerous clues about the Great Riddle of Your Life -- you know, the brain-teasing, heart-stretching enigma that will take years for you to solve completely. So be alert! Revelations may arrive from unexpected sources and inadvertent teachers. Even seemingly insignificant events may be pregnant with pithy hints. To cultivate the right kind of receptivity, be on the lookout not only for crisp answers, but also for ideas about how to formulate the Great Riddle more clearly. P.S.: Keep an image of a sphinx near you at all times. It'll help supercharge your intuition.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Your trust was violated in the past, and you still feel the wound. You keep it in the background of your awareness, fascinated with the way it never really heals. Though I sympathize, I want you to know that it's time to move on. Your horrified disbelief about having been treated so badly is close to becoming just another bad habit. Your instinct for self-protection is threatening to devolve into indulgent self-pity. What should you do? The first thing is to forgive yourself for the blindness that put you in the path of those who betrayed you. The second step is to restore your trust in yourself. Third, find a way to feel gratitude for those who abused your trust. Yes, you heard me right: Be thankful for all they taught you about how to become yourself.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

When he first invented the printing press in the fifteenth century, Johannes Gutenberg used it to fashion frivolous little things like sets of playing cards. Only later did he put it to work mass-producing books, turning it into a revolutionary tool for disseminating information. I foresee a similar evolution for you in the coming weeks, Leo. In the early going, you'll employ a wonderful new resource in a relatively impractical way; or maybe a big, fresh idea will first appear in a trivial context. Not to worry, though. After the initial false starts and wasteful experiments, you will ultimately discover an elegant use for your innovation. Be patient.

If you're willing, life will soon offer you not just a fleeting glimpse but a penetrating gaze at what has been concealed beneath the surface. You'll be invited to shed your preconceptions and come face-to-face with hidden agendas, missing links, and fertile secrets. If you'd rather not accept life's overture to strip away pretenses, please forget you ever read this horoscope. To retain it in your memory would interfere with your enjoyment of the pretty packaging that veils the slightly disturbing, totally invigorating contents inside.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Just as I have little patience for people who perpetuate ethnic stereotypes, I also cringe at astrologers who assume that all Libras are unflappably gracious, obsessed with relationships, and unable to make up their minds. While there is a grain of truth in those characterizations, they're oppressive if regarded as immutable cosmic law. You need the freedom to complain now and then, especially when a situation has become so filled with deception and illusion that it's hurting people. To remain unflappably gracious in the face of a mess like that would be wrong. Likewise, on occasion you need to forget what's best for a relationship and instead concentrate on what's best for you. This is one of those times, Libra, when you have license to rebel against astrology's stereotypes.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

An image of the Virgin Mary materialized on the window of a home in Ohio. That, at least, is what an imaginative neighbor believed, though the occupants themselves were apathetic. But the neighbor spread the word, and soon pilgrims were coming from afar to be in the presence of the miracle. A blind woman regained her sight; a man in a wheelchair walked for the first time in eight years; a six-year-old child with life-threatening asthma breathed freely again. Then the maid came. It was her regular day to work. The homeowners neglected to tell her not to clean the special window, and she did. The blessed image disappeared and the crowd dispersed. Moral of the story, Scorpio: The magic that comes your way this week might be a bit messy -- indeed, it might even rise out of a mess. Don't clean it up.

Evangelical Christian TV personality Pat Robertson says God told him that George W. Bush will win the U.S. presidential election in a landslide. That's odd, because God told me the exact opposite: Bush will be out of office and sitting on the board of Halliburton by February, 2005. To my knowledge, Robertson has not yet commented on the upcoming binge of intelligent fun and righteous pleasure that astrologers are predicting for you Sagittarians. My guess, though, is that *his* God wouldn't approve. My God, on the other hand, predicts that you will generate good karma as you have a sweet, boisterous time.

An entrepreneur approached me with a proposal. "Your work should be getting out to a bigger audience. The masses are starving for the message you're putting out. That's why you need me. With my marketing machine, your name could become as recognizable as Deepak Chopra's. Let's build an entertainment conglomerate and hawk a hundred Rob Brezsny-style products." "Nah," I said. "People come to me seeking sanctuary from hype. They know I won't smack them upside the head with relentless sales pitches." I urge you to adopt a similar attitude in the coming week, Capricorn. Let everyone relax in your presence, knowing they won't be hustled, cajoled, or manipulated.

The Golden Rule is a decent ethical principle, but it could be even better. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" presumes that others like what you like. But that's laughably naive and potentially a big mistake. There are many things you would like to have done unto you that others would either despise or be bored by. Here's a new, improved formulation, which we'll call the Platinum Rule: Do unto others as they would like to have you do unto them. Of course these are always powerful words to live by, Aquarius, but especially now. It's time to take your integrity to the next level.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Contrary to the assumptions of misinformed "skeptics," real astrology has nothing to do with the stars, except for one star: our sun. The 12 signs of the zodiac don't correspond to constellations, but demarcate symbolic phases of the cyclic relationship between the sun and Earth. Here's another correction of one of the skeptics' many misunderstandings: Astrology is an art, not a science. While it does have a logical coherency and can be of great use in understanding the mystery of our lives, it's not a precise body of facts based on repeatable experiments. It's a mythic language that trains our imaginations to be aware of the links between our inner world and the outer world. Now, Pisces, take inspiration from my words as you fight back against those who judge and criticize you even though they don't understand you.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For too long, grace has eluded you; you have had to fight your way through life. But now your luck is about to turn; your soul will get the refreshment it needs. To celebrate, imagine you're the one speaking in this poem by Theodore Roethke: 

"Near the rose, in this grove of sun-parched, wind-warped madrones

Among the half-dead trees, I came upon the true ease of myself, 

As if another person appeared out of the depths of my being,

And I stood outside myself,

Beyond becoming and perishing.

A something wholly other,

As if I swayed out on the wildest wave alive,

And yet was still.

And I rejoiced in being what I was."

In the first Matrix movie, the central character, Thomas "Neo" Anderson, gradually begins to suspect that his entire understanding of reality is a delusion. At a key moment, a mysterious ally named Morpheus offers him a choice between two pills. If Neo takes the red pill, Morpheus tells him, he will be able to see the truth he has been blind to. If he swallows the blue pill, he will sink comfortably back into the lie he has been living. I see the coming weeks as a comparable turning point for you, Taurus. Which will it be, the red pill or the blue pill?

I'll tell you a little cosmic secret, Gemini. One of the best ways to stay on top -- which is where you are now, right? -- is to keep paying homage to the bottom. So as you harvest your good fortune in the coming weeks, I suggest you express your gratitude for the painful experiences that have taught you how to thrive. While basking in the glow of people's praise and attention, recall the parts of you that are still unripe. When you come home after a day of radiant success, take out the garbage.

In anticipation of the creativity I expect will flow through you this week, Cancerian, I'm going to describe you, too, as an imagineer. It's not that I expect you to literally invent a radical new variation on a roller coaster or anything. But there's a good chance you'll come up with brilliant innovations in the way you have fun.

What's the best way to get yourself in sync with the plans that the Goddess has for you? Follow poet Robert Bly's admonition to "poke holes in your habits." Here are a few suggestions to get you started. Strike up a conversation with a person you'd normally ignore. Write with your non-dominant hand. Try a food you've never tasted. Sprinkle seldom-used words like "sublime," "curiosity," and "reverence" into your conversation. Walk backwards now and then. Slap a crafty grin on your face and wish for something impossible.

To get you in the mood, I've infused the rest of this horoscope with subliminal suggestions that are scientifically formulated to make you a magnet for favors and synchronicities. (Combustion luster verve blaze.) They will set in motion shifts in your inner chemistry that will help other people see how beautiful you are. (Luminous flourish lucid mojo.)

I'm always on the lookout for real heroes. Not the celebrities, athletes, and other fake heroes endlessly hyped by the mainstream media, but brave innovators who show courageous flair in standing up for what's right. The good news is that I recently located an actual hero, and he's a Libra. It's Gavin Newsom, mayor of San Francisco, a Rosa Parks-like figure in the crusade to extend a full array of civil liberties to gays. In his calm fight for fairness, in his skillful use of logic to deal with emotionally charged issues, and in his artful approach to breaking an absurd taboo against joy and passion, he has embodied the highest expression of your sign's potentials. I recommend that you imitate his approach in your own sphere during the coming weeks.

In his book, America As Empire: Global Leader or Rogue Power?, Jim Garrison says America has changed from being a republic to an imperial empire. If you're liberal, you hate this development, and if you're conservative, you like it; but in any case, the deed is done. The genie won't go back into the bottle. The question now is, how will America wield its global power? Will it be a bully using brute force to serve its narrow economic aims? Or will it be a gracious sovereign, leading a movement to bring democracy and freedom to every corner of the globe? In my view, Scorpio, you're facing a small-scale version of this dilemma in your personal sphere. How will you handle the weighty responsibilities that accompany your increasing clout? Will you mostly indulge your selfish interests, or will you work for the good of all?

It took six years for Mark Salzman to write his novel, Lying Awake. When it was done, he told the "New Yorker" about the tortures he'd put himself through as he fought against writer's block. During one stretch, he shut out distracting sounds by wrapping a towel around his head. To discourage his cats from crawling on his lap as he wrote, he covered his lower body with aluminum foil. But nothing worked until he fled to a quiet cabin in the woods. "It was like waking from a bad dream," he said, "-- the removal of all the reminders of art as a profession, as a way of making money or gaining a reputation. The book wrote itself in five weeks." I suspect that after enduring a period akin to Salzman's arduous warm-up, Sagittarius, you're about to have a cathartic five-week breakthrough of your own.

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Your imminent future reminds me of the archaeologists in Scotland who celebrated when they thought they found the remains of a ninth-century Viking village. Upon further review, however, they realized it was actually the site of a suburban patio from the 1940s. Like them, Capricorn, you will probably be disappointed in your initial forays into the mysterious depths; what you unearth will rouse hopes that are quickly dashed. Unlike the archaeologists, though, you will eventually locate treasure lying beneath the discredited discovery -- if you keep digging, that is.

Hungry for more inspiration, Capricorn? Curious about the unfolding mysteries? For more juicy details about your destiny in the coming week, check out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"Be born into the right family. Choose your chromosomes wisely." So begins a list in which Aquarian heiress Paris Hilton details her secrets of success. "Develop a way of entering a room that looks almost royal -- but NOT snobby," she continues. "Never have only one cell phone when you can have many. Eat only the worst junk food or the most fabulous food there is, but nothing in between. Only sleep in Egyptian cotton sheets with a 400 to 600 thread count." I offer you these definitions, Aquarius, in the hope that they'll inspire you to compose your own list. It's an ideal time for you to get very specific about how you plan to achieve happiness and fulfillment.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

It's check-in time, Pisces. What progress have you been making in your work on this year's major assignment? As I suggested last December, 2004 will be prime time for learning much, much more about the arts of intimacy. So have you been shedding bad habits and unripe attitudes that in the past interfered with your ability to get the closeness you want? Have you sought teaching from experts who are wise about relationships? Have you vowed to seek unions only with emotionally intelligent people who take responsibility for their own darkness?

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Pisces? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For too long, grace has eluded you; you have had to fight your way through life. But now your luck is about to turn; your soul will get the refreshment it needs. To celebrate, imagine you're the one speaking in this poem by Theodore Roethke: 

"Near the rose, in this grove of sun-parched, wind-warped madrones

Among the half-dead trees, I came upon the true ease of myself, 

As if another person appeared out of the depths of my being,

And I stood outside myself,

Beyond becoming and perishing.

A something wholly other,

As if I swayed out on the wildest wave alive,

And yet was still.

And I rejoiced in being what I was."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In the first Matrix movie, the central character, Thomas "Neo" Anderson, gradually begins to suspect that his entire understanding of reality is a delusion. At a key moment, a mysterious ally named Morpheus offers him a choice between two pills. If Neo takes the red pill, Morpheus tells him, he will be able to see the truth he has been blind to. If he swallows the blue pill, he will sink comfortably back into the lie he has been living. I see the coming weeks as a comparable turning point for you, Taurus. Which will it be, the red pill or the blue pill?

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Taurus. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I'll tell you a little cosmic secret, Gemini. One of the best ways to stay on top -- which is where you are now, right? -- is to keep paying homage to the bottom. So as you harvest your good fortune in the coming weeks, I suggest you express your gratitude for the painful experiences that have taught you how to thrive. While basking in the glow of people's praise and attention, recall the parts of you that are still unripe. When you come home after a day of radiant success, take out the garbage.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Last century, Walt Disney coined a word for the inventive engineers who designed the rides and attractions for Disneyland: imagineers. In anticipation of the creativity I expect will flow through you this week, Cancerian, I'm going to describe you, too, as an imagineer. It's not that I expect you to literally invent a radical new variation on a roller coaster or anything. But there's a good chance you'll come up with brilliant innovations in the way you have fun.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

What's the best way to get yourself in sync with the plans that the Goddess has for you? Follow poet Robert Bly's admonition to "poke holes in your habits." Here are a few suggestions to get you started. Strike up a conversation with a person you'd normally ignore. Write with your non-dominant hand. Try a food you've never tasted. Sprinkle seldom-used words like "sublime," "curiosity," and "reverence" into your conversation. Walk backwards now and then. Slap a crafty grin on your face and wish for something impossible.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Leo? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Don't sit there passively, Virgo, hoping that fate will be nice to you. Be aggressive about cultivating good fortune. Drum up and track down the lucky breaks you need. To get you in the mood, I've infused the rest of this horoscope with subliminal suggestions that are scientifically formulated to make you a magnet for favors and synchronicities. (Combustion luster verve blaze.) They will set in motion shifts in your inner chemistry that will help other people see how beautiful you are. (Luminous flourish lucid mojo.) Soon you'll be tuning in to evidence that life is actually conspiring for you to succeed. (Lightning splendor wake-up fuel.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I'm always on the lookout for real heroes. Not the celebrities, athletes, and other fake heroes endlessly hyped by the mainstream media, but brave innovators who show courageous flair in standing up for what's right. The good news is that I recently located an actual hero, and he's a Libra. It's Gavin Newsom, mayor of San Francisco, a Rosa Parks-like figure in the crusade to extend a full array of civil liberties to gays. In his calm fight for fairness, in his skillful use of logic to deal with emotionally charged issues, and in his artful approach to breaking an absurd taboo against joy and passion, he has embodied the highest expression of your sign's potentials. I recommend that you imitate his approach in your own sphere during the coming weeks.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In his book, America As Empire: Global Leader or Rogue Power?, Jim Garrison says America has changed from being a republic to an imperial empire. If you're liberal, you hate this development, and if you're conservative, you like it; but in any case, the deed is done. The genie won't go back into the bottle. The question now is, how will America wield its global power? Will it be a bully using brute force to serve its narrow economic aims? Or will it be a gracious sovereign, leading a movement to bring democracy and freedom to every corner of the globe? In my view, Scorpio, you're facing a small-scale version of this dilemma in your personal sphere. How will you handle the weighty responsibilities that accompany your increasing clout? Will you mostly indulge your selfish interests, or will you work for the good of all?

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Scorpio? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The opportunity that's available to you may not be entirely appealing to your pride. It would require you to place yourself in service to a force that's greater than you. I compare it to the role played by Steve Williams, the caddie for golf superstar Tiger Woods. Carrying around a bag of golf clubs may not seem glamorous, but Williams earns as much as $1 million a year doing it for Woods.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Novelist Ursula K. Le Guin decries the linear perspective that dominates modern storytelling. She says it's "like an arrow, starting here and going straight there and THOK! hitting its mark." Furthermore, she complains, plots are usually advanced through conflict, as if interesting action can't possibly arise from any other catalyst. Your assignment in the coming week, Taurus, is to rebel against these oppressive conventions. Boycott any story whose narrative drive is fueled primarily by painful events. Protest movies that imply most human experiences are fraught with difficulty and resolved neatly. Most importantly, look back and celebrate the luminous mysteries that have shaped your life story: the meandering fascinations that didn't lead to tidy conclusions, the wobbly joys that fed your soul, the adventures whose success was built on sweet breakthroughs rather than triumphs over suffering.

"I like to coax my opponents into attacking," he says, "to let them taste the joy of the initiative, so that they may get carried away, become careless, and sacrifice material." Please meditate on how you might adopt this approach to use in your next gambit, Gemini. It's time, in my astrological opinion, for some smart mischief.

Reading books by psychologist Carl Jung or mythologist Joseph Campbell would be excellent for your health. So would doing a meditation session under the night sky or contemplating your dreams as you take in a planetarium show. Have you ever heard the ancient mystical formula, "As above, so below"? It means the cosmos is reflected in your psyche, and vice versa. Look everywhere for evidence that it's true.

In Grimms' version of the fairy tale, "Sleeping Beauty," all the trouble stemmed from a seemingly minor mistake: The king and queen invited 12 of the realm's fairies to their daughter's party, but ignored the 13th simply because they only had 12 gold plates. This last fairy came anyway, angrily crashing the feast and casting a curse as vengeance for her snub. I advise you not to make a similar gaffe this week, Leo. Even if your personal equivalent of the thirteenth fairy is an awkward character or a disruptive presence, you need that influence right now. And the practical fact of the matter is that if you don't welcome it, it'll mess with you; if you do welcome it, it'll bless you.

Its roundabout approach to helping you fulfill your dreams must become more direct and straightforward -- or else! Specifically, I demand that the gods, fates, dispensers of karma, or however they want to be referred to, must, no later than March 13, 2004, begin to provide you with a steady stream of satisfying interpersonal encounters. This must include, though it is not limited to, more tender intimacy, more engaging friendships, and more interesting conversations.

For those of you without a dictionary nearby, a "pyrrhic victory" is defined as a costly triumph, useless advantage, or empty success. What's your best bet for avoiding it? First, start thinking of what your soul needs rather than what your ego craves. Second, forget about trying to provide balance to a distorted situation that's too fixed to be influenced. Third, become aware of how your focus on what you dislike is reinforcing what you dislike.

"Perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave." -Rilke. 3.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

I'm guessing that your imagination is both excited and perplexed; that your senses are heightened yet on the verge of being overwhelmed. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you're going through a phase that at its best might be called a medley and at its most challenging a hodgepodge. It has resemblances to the sibuxiang, a mythic Chinese animal with the head of a dragon, antlers of a deer, tail of a lion, hooves of an ox, and body covered with fishy scales. So is there anything you can do to ensure that you use this time to stir up innovative solutions to long-standing problems? Here's one suggestion: Once a day for five minutes, close your eyes and visualize yourself pulling off rodeo tricks while riding an exuberant sibuxiang.

As I suggested last December, everything you thought you knew about commitment is due for a major overhaul. Before 2004 is over, you must transform the way you weave your fortunes together with worthy allies. By now, you should be at least halfway through this extended turning point; you should have shed outworn ideas about collaboration and conjured up fresh approaches. The next stage of the process begins soon: wherein you formally break off pacts with erratic and emotionally unavailable people, and seal deals with responsible, emotionally intelligent people.

Imagine that your life is a detective story. The goal is not to solve a crime, but to solve the mystery of why you're here on earth so you can carry out the special mission you've come to accomplish. Sometimes you go for months without even looking for clues. You sleepwalk through the world, reacting blindly to the tricks that the gods use to try to wake you up. Then there are those phases when hot leads and fresh evidence pop up all over the place, convincing you beyond a doubt that magic is one of the fundamental properties of reality. This is one of those times, Pisces.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

What time is it, boys and girls? It's SHADOW TIME. Are you ready to negotiate with the chaotic, confusing feelings you usually hide from? Would you consider tunneling down into your soul's darkest pit and hunting for the hidden treasure there? Here are a few morsels to take with you on your journey. 1. "That which we do not bring to consciousness appears in our lives as fate." -Jung. 2. "Perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave." -Rilke. 3. "The great epochs in our lives are at the points when we gain the courage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us." -Nietzsche.

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

I'm guessing that your imagination is both excited and perplexed; that your senses are heightened yet on the verge of being overwhelmed. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you're going through a phase that at its best might be called a medley and at its most challenging a hodgepodge. It has resemblances to the sibuxiang, a mythic Chinese animal with the head of a dragon, antlers of a deer, tail of a lion, hooves of an ox, and body covered with fishy scales. So is there anything you can do to ensure that you use this time to stir up innovative solutions to long-standing problems? Here's one suggestion: Once a day for five minutes, close your eyes and visualize yourself pulling off rodeo tricks while riding an exuberant sibuxiang.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

It's check-in time, Aquarius. What progress have you been making in your work on this year's major assignment? As I suggested last December, everything you thought you knew about commitment is due for a major overhaul. Before 2004 is over, you must transform the way you weave your fortunes together with worthy allies. By now, you should be at least halfway through this extended turning point; you should have shed outworn ideas about collaboration and conjured up fresh approaches. The next stage of the process begins soon: wherein you formally break off pacts with erratic and emotionally unavailable people, and seal deals with responsible, emotionally intelligent people.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Imagine that your life is a detective story. The goal is not to solve a crime, but to solve the mystery of why you're here on earth so you can carry out the special mission you've come to accomplish. Sometimes you go for months without even looking for clues. You sleepwalk through the world, reacting blindly to the tricks that the gods use to try to wake you up. Then there are those phases when hot leads and fresh evidence pop up all over the place, convincing you beyond a doubt that magic is one of the fundamental properties of reality. This is one of those times, Pisces. 

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Pisces? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Do you ever feel an urge to kiss trees? Do animals sometimes talk to you? Can you predict the future by divining the way corn flakes float in the last puddle of milk in your bowl? Do you have a special fascination with chocolate roosters, statues of pro wrestlers, and conspiracy theories? Have you ever fantasized of being a transsexual spy? Are there patterns that resemble constellations on the soles of your feet? If you answered yes to two or more of these questions, you're most likely an extraterrestrial who has amnesia or is in disguise. The upcoming week will be fantastic because events will remind you of life on your home planet. If you answered no to four or more questions, you're probably not an alien, but for maximum comfort you should act like one this week.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Aries? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The world's largest private bank, Citigroup, has agreed to stop financing projects that damage sensitive ecosystems. It has promised to invest more in projects that use renewable energy and to pursue policies that protect indigenous people. How did this impossible dream come to pass? The humble but dogged environmental group, Rainforest Action Network, creatively pestered Citigroup for years until the corporation gave into its demands. I see a comparable David-over-Goliath victory in your future, Taurus, so keep plugging away at your quixotic quest. For inspiration, recall Margaret Mead's words: "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Taurus. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun is rising about a minute earlier each morning and setting a minute later every evening. As a result, you're drinking in about 15 minutes more sunlight every week. The psychological effect of this steady influx has been slowly growing, and, in concert with certain astrological influences, will soon reach critical mass. As a result, you will become sun-like: a luminous beacon of warmth. Everything you shine upon will look brighter, and your own beauty will be highly visible, too. It will be a perfect time, therefore, to make a dramatic move that helps you pursue your dreams harder and smarter.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Many people have come to feel that nature is boring, notes educator Thomas Poplawski. Writing in "Renewal" magazine, he fingers TV's hyperactive imagery as the cause. In becoming addicted to this alternative reality, the mass audience has become numb to the more slow-paced entertainment value of trees and mountains and streams and clouds. Have you been contaminated? Has your capacity for patient observation and reverent objectivity been damaged? If so, this is a perfect astrological moment to seek the cure. I urge you to wander out into the wild places and stay there until you see how interesting they are.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

If you eventually become a millionaire philanthropist at some later date, it will probably be because of the forces you set in motion during the next three weeks. If, in the 22nd century, there arises a religious cult that worships you as a sex god or love goddess, it will be because of a seed you germinate very soon. Finally, Leo, if you are ultimately destined to discover the key to eternal youth, it will have a lot to do with the spacious new question you begin to ask now. These are days of awe and mystery.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Leo? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In order to live, you've got to be a demolisher. You take plants and animals that were once alive and rip them apart with your teeth, then disintegrate them in your digestive system. Your body is literally on fire inside, burning up oxygen you suck into your lungs. You didn't actually cut down the trees used to make your house and furniture, but you colluded with their demise. Then there's the psychological liquidation you've done: killing off old beliefs you've outgrown, for instance. I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, Virgo -- just pointing out that you have a lot of experience with positive expressions of destruction. Can you think of other forms this magic takes? It's your specialty these days.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

It's a perfect time to launch an uprising against God. Due to a favorable alignment of your sign, the "rebel goddess" asteroid Lilith, and Cruithne, Earth's "second moon," you have special leeway with the Supreme Being. It's almost certain that you won't be punished if you bitch and complain to Him about the injustices he has allowed to fester in your life. In fact, expressing your angry protest may even get things changed for the better. Sometimes the squeaky wheel really does get the grease, even in divine matters.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Some branches of Eastern religions teach the doctrine "Kill out desire." In their view, yearning for earthly pleasures is at the root of all human suffering. The Western religion of materialism takes the opposite tack, asserting that the meaning of life is to be found in enjoying earthly pleasures. Its message is "Feed your raw longings like a French foie gras farmer cramming eight pounds of maize down a goose's gullet every day." We here at Free Will Astrology walk a middle path. We believe there are many degrading desires that enslave you and a few sacred desires that liberate you. Your mission in the coming weeks, Scorpio, is to identify the sacred kind and pursue them with your wild heart unleashed.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Your power this week will come primarily from decisions not made, words not spoken, actions not taken, and spaces not filled. Everything you need will arrive if you have created enough emptiness. Everything you love will thrive if it has the freedom to do and be nothing. To ensure that you never succumb to the pressure of Type A bullies who think every moment has to be filled with ambitious commotion, steal away often to stare dreamily out the window and listen to the sound of silence.

It's time for a check-in, Capricorn. What progress have you been making in your work on this year's major assignments? As I suggested last December, you're most likely to attract good fortune in 2004 if you regularly break out of your comfort zone and go wandering in unfamiliar places. You'll discover fresh secrets about how to feel happy and healthy whenever you dip into an experimental mode and try things you've never tried before. Alas, I fear many of you have yet to make a whole-hearted commitment to this thrilling quest. But if you have been waffling, it's the perfect week to dive in. And if you did take the plunge a while ago, you'll harvest a big reward any day now.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Since 1994, Mexico's Zapatistas have evolved from a small guerrilla army fighting for the rights of indigenous people to an international cultural force whose battles are mostly waged with symbols and words. The Zapatista leader, who goes by the pseudonym Subcomandante Marcos, always appears in public wearing a mask. Periodically, his old mask wears out and he has to replace it with a fresh one. Rumor has it that he has gone through ten in ten years. I think this would be a good standard for all of us to live up to: to molt our persona, or social mask, once a year. It's about that time for you, Aquarius. Considering how much your inner world has transformed, it wouldn't make sense for you to keep your same old game face much longer.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Normally I endorse the proverb that says, "You can't cross a chasm in two short jumps." In your current state of grace, however, you just may be able to find a loophole in that cosmic law. The massive amounts of dumb luck that have been surging your way seem to be on the verge of mutating into out-and-out miracles. You could be the first anti-hero in your family line to turbo-charge a quantum leap of faith in mid-leap.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You know that library book you checked out in 1999 and still have in your bookcase? It's time to return it to the library, preferably along with a partial payment. Remember the unconscious way you broke up with one of your old flames? It's time to send an apology. How about that dumb thing you did to sabotage your own happiness once upon a time? Isn't it about time you forgave yourself and shed your lingering remorse? Hell has frozen over, Aries. Pigs have grown wings. Make the atonements you thought you'd never make in a thousand years.

University students in Poland have discovered an unexpected way to boost their grades: wearing red underwear while taking tests. Ever since researchers presented evidence of the "red underwear effect," clothing stores have reported a run on scarlet-hued bras, underpants, and boxer shorts around exam times. Maybe it's merely the result of mass hysteria, but what difference does it make if it truly enhances the students' performance under pressure? I suggest you consider hopping on this trend, Taurus. What have you got to lose from regularly donning red skivvies during this, the final-exam phase of your yearly cycle?

If oil companies were given a green light to drill Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they'd ultimately produce 42 million gallons of black gold every day. America's dependence on foreign oil would diminish, which might in turn reduce its inclination to use military force to ensure its supply. But there is a simpler way to accomplish the same goal. If the fuel efficiency of SUVs were boosted a mere three miles per gallon, America's daily oil consumption would decrease by 49 million gallons. I suggest you keep this scenario in mind, Gemini, as you head towards a turning point in your personal life. Rather than exploit and pollute one of your natural talents for a seemingly good cause, I suggest you seek an alternate way to accomplish that good cause. It may take a relatively minor adjustment.

In an effort to improve the image of the pit bull, New York City has officially changed the dog's name to "New Yorkies." I propose that we Crabs try a similar experiment. Isn't it time we try shedding our linguistic connection with the killer disease? How about if for the next three weeks we call our sign "Thunderbird" or "Quantum Flux" or "Vanquisher" instead of "Cancer"? Let's see if it stimulates subtle changes in the way we think about ourselves. It's the perfect time to try it. We're currently in an astrological phase when we have maximum power to transcend limitations.

Let's do a check-in, Leo. In the first eight weeks of 2004, how well have you taken advantage of the stellar wealth-building opportunities? Have you been doing the inner work necessary to increase your value? Have you unleashed your imagination in a quest to heal and supercharge your relationship with money? Have you started to lay the groundwork for the livelihood you want to be doing by March 1, 2009? It's prime time to intensify your efforts in all these tasks. P.S. I suggest that you also cultivate relationships with collaborators who can help you attract resources you'll need for a long time.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Lent is the period between Ash Wednesday and Easter when devout Christians commemorate the 40 days that Christ allegedly spent resisting the devil's temptations in the wilderness. Growing up Episcopalian, I was taught to imitate Jesus every year at this time by giving up something I had a strong attachment to. My usual choice was candy. It so happens, Virgo, that even if you're not Christian, the coming weeks will be an excellent time for you to renounce three experiences that you have become a bit addicted to. Those experiences are berating yourself, denying yourself pleasure, and giving till it hurts. I urge you to give them all up between now and April 10.

As I suggested two months ago, you should expedite the dying of the Old You, preparing the way for the birth of the New You later in 2004. So have you been taking brave steps to liberate yourself from the past? Have you opened yourself to the possibility of making radical departures from business-as-usual? Do you whisper the word "resurrection" to yourself as you fall asleep each night? If you've been carrying out this quest in even a half-assed way, the coming week will bring you a poignant gift.

Your ability to speak moving words and initiate useful changes is at a peak. So is your knack for revealing your inner beauty and attracting the help and attention you want. How will you wield these awesome powers? Like a manipulative megalomaniac bent on ruling your little corner of the world, always angling for personal gain? Or like a fascinating fount of blessings, eager to share your wealth as you hunt down inspiring adventures with relentless ingenuity?

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Scorpio? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Northern California, the place I call home, has more spiritual workshops per capita than anywhere else on earth. On a given weekend, you can choose from yoga retreats, meditation classes, astrology intensives, and a hundred other adventures in woo-woo. Grizzled veterans of the scene have a phrase to describe the attitude of workshop leaders who are overly proud of how enlightened they are -- who ooze a pretentious solemnity that belies the divine grace they're supposedly championing. The term is "stinky Zen." It's a perfect way to convey the fact that humorless self-importance can sabotage even the finest ideals. Be on the alert for this stench, Sagittarius -- not only in New Age types, but in everyone else, too. I nominate you to be the earthy whistleblower who makes sure that all the deep truths stay fun and funny.

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Some British celebrities turn down the honors their government proposes to bestow on them. For example, actor Albert Finney refused to become a knight, saying it was "a disease which perpetuates snobbery." Similarly, some people reject gifts they can't use or don't want. My friend Glenda's uncle offered to give her an ostrich farm in Louisiana on the condition that she move there and oversee its operation. No thanks, she said. I advise you to be on the alert for meaningless honors and pseudo-blessings like these, Capricorn. Don't let them distract you from the real thing, which will arrive later.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

At no time in the week ahead will you be struck by lightning, squeezed by a giant python, or blindsided by an old nemesis. I do predict that an unexpected force will hit you upside your attitude, but it will be the kind that's good for you. Here are some examples of what form this intervention might take. You could be splashed with a squirt gun by a friend who wants to break down an awkwardness or formality that has undermined your closeness; you could be hit with rolled-up socks thrown by a child who has something important to tell you; or you may be hugged with surprising ferocity by a person who is suddenly sorry to have been taking you for granted.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

 Some astrologers believe that an unusually high percentage of babies born on February 29 grow up to be bisexual. I would go further and say that people born on that day are more likely to become bisexual, transgendered, double-jointed, ambidextrous double agents who are equally skilled at accessing both their left and right brain. Even you Pisceans who were not born on that exceptional day will be injected with a hefty dose of the February 29 spirit this week. It should be an excellent time to have your cake and eat it, too.

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Pisces? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

On February 1, six big-name entertainers took control of the Super Bowl halftime show. The result was a histrionically boring spectacle of robotic sexuality and fake emotion. If there was any saving grace amidst the monumental emptiness, it was Janet Jackson's climactic unveiling. In a New York Times article, Alessandra Stanley wrote, "The one moment of honesty in that coldly choreographed tableau was when the cup came off and out tumbled a normal middle-aged woman's breast instead of an idealized Playboy bunny implant." Your assignment in the coming week, Aries, is to be inspired by that moment of honesty. Strip away pretension and phoniness everywhere you find them, thereby exposing the raw humanity that lies beneath. One caveat: Do this ethically, and without breaking the law.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Aries? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The President of Belarus has issued a mandate to his country's athletes regarding their performance in the 2004 Summer Olympics. "You should have clear-cut plans for victory," Alyaksandr Lukashenka told them. "It is unacceptable for you to win fewer than 25 medals." That sounds a bit unrealistic to me, so I won't be that demanding in my decree to you, Taurus. But the astrological omens are on my side as I command you to pull off a feat that would be your equivalent of a gold medal between now and March 20. In addition, I order you to gather a new privilege, new perk, or new title.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Taurus. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

After years of occupation by the Soviet Union, Georgia became an independent republic in 1991. Its new leader was Eduard Shevardnadze, who over the next 12 years brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy and became the most hated man in public life. Last November he relinquished power in the face of a "revolution of roses," a bloodless insurrection led by protestors brandishing flowers. Two months later, one of the leading "rose revolutionaries," 36-year-old Mikhail Saakashvili, was elected Georgia's new president. I suggest that you Geminis make Saakashvili your role model for the next two months. You've got a lot of status quo to overthrow, and the best way to do it is with your version of flower power.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

According to my analysis of the astrological omens, it's time for you to make two corrections. First, you are suffering from an exaggerated sense of what's possible to accomplish in the short term. I urge you to deflate your grandiosity a bit. Second, your expectations of what you can pull off in the long run are way too small. I authorize you to pump them up.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Our subject this week, class, is the aphorism, "If at first you don't succeed, redefine the meaning of success." Your assignment is to make practical use of this principle. Judging from the current astrological omens, I think the best place to apply it might be in your love life. If you agree, here's a suggestion about how to proceed. First, figure out what it is you've been doing wrong that has kept you from getting the exact kind of love you want. (One possibility is that your soul and your ego are craving different things and therefore working at cross-purposes.) Second, revise your definition of the exact kind of love you want, incorporating a more realistic assessment of who you are. Third, forgive yourself for having previously had an inadequate definition.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I'm grateful for my years of psychotherapy. They've been crucial in helping me shed bad mental habits and master the art of being happy. How about you, Virgo? Have you ever met regularly with an empath whose primary purpose is to listen to you and enhance your life? It's a perfect time to start giving yourself this necessary luxury. Or, if you're one of the lucky few who already has a skilled wise person working in service to them, it's a favorable time to dive deeper into the work. The astrological omens suggest that you now have the power to get more help than you've received before -- but you have to ask for it.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry is a bit stiff, but his Libran wife Teresa is just the opposite. "She can be as unbuttoned in her speech as Kerry is buttoned up in his," wrote Philip Gourevitch in "The New Yorker," "with the result that she is sometimes impolitic and always worth listening to." In Salon.com, Rebecca Traister said Teresa has complained that George W. Bush "is afraid to be Socratic" and that he entered his presidency "with a lack of curiosity about the job." She playfully told one interviewer that if John is elected, her main job as first lady will be to keep him humble. I urge you to make Teresa your role model in the coming week, Libra. Be unbuttoned, impolitic, Socratic, curious, and worth listening to. Use humor to keep yourself and everyone around you humble.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Love may not conquer all in the coming weeks, Scorpio, but it could conquer 60 percent, and even as much as 75. The key factor in determining love's power to accomplish wonders will be your knack for avoiding obsessive perfectionism and all-or-nothing thinking. You should work with love like a master politician who's skilled at compromise, not like a glory-seeking hero who thinks she can change everything overnight.

"The fishermen of the Colombian coast must be learned doctors of ethics and morality," writes Eduardo Galeano in The Book of Embraces, "for they invented the [Spanish] word sentipensante, or 'feeling-thinking,' to define language that speaks the truth." I advise you to make sentipensante your word of power in the coming days, Sagittarius. It may help you synchronize your galloping emotions and your restless intellect. And that may be your best hope for solving the conundrums headed your way. Here's another way to describe your assignment: Think with your heart and feel with your mind.

In his 1989 song, "Fight the Power," Public Enemy's lead rapper Chuck D expressed his opinion of Elvis Presley: "Elvis was a hero to most/ But he never meant sh*t to me, you see/ Straight up racist that sucker was, simple and plain." Thirteen years later, Chuck D presented a different story, telling Newsday he had "a great deal of respect" for Elvis. I suggest you follow Chuck D's example in the coming week, Capricorn. It takes courage to shift your position as radically as he did, and I hope you can do the same. It's a perfect moment to officially change your mind about at least two important issues.

Has your relationship with money been suffering from any ignorance or chaos? If so, the next seven months will be a favorable time to fix that. The cosmos will be conspiring to help you upgrade your financial savvy. To the degree that you co-conspire, you will get richer a lot quicker. Here's the best news: It all starts in earnest now.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You will wake up one morning and realize you're more free than you've been in a long time. Nagging ghosts will have lost their power to bug you. Stale traditions will have faded. You will have made your last payment on an old karmic debt. Through an act of grace you don't fully understand, mind-forged manacles will have vanished. So what should you do next? I suggest you celebrate. Throw a "Get Out of Jail" party for yourself. Then run wild for a couple of days. When you're good and ready to harness your adorable new independence, ask yourself, "In what area of my life is it most important that I start fresh?"

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Happy Valentine Daze, Aries! Here's an important bulletin from poet Emily Dickinson: Until you have been in love, you cannot become yourself. I'd like you to try that revolutionary idea on for size, Aries. Do this experiment. For a given period -- say the coming week or the next ten years -- act as if the only way you can ever find out who you really are is to lose yourself in sublime yearning for a worthy partner. Assume, for the sake of argument, that one of the best strategies for becoming the unique masterpiece you were born to be is to help a person you love become the unique masterpiece he or she was meant to be.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Happy Valentine Daze, Taurus! The Goddess of Love, Aphrodite Herself, has asked me to remind you that you have always been in love. You will always be in love. In fact, it is impossible for you not to be in love. You'd be unable to get out of bed each morning unless there were someone or something that roused your heart and stirred your imagination. So please just admit that you are alive because of love; that you are made of love. Now write a list of the ten things you love most, and devote some time in each of the next seven days to expressing your appreciation.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Happy Valentine Daze, Gemini! After careful meditation about what advice would be most likely to energize your love life, I've decided to suggest that you say your prayers while having sex with a saint in a sacred place. If you can't manage all that at once, at least try praying while doing the wild thing, or fooling around with a saint, or making out in a church or temple, or talking dirty to God. One way or another, Gemini, you should blend earthly pleasures and spiritual aspirations. Here's a quote to write on your mirror or your forearm: "I never knew how to worship until I knew how to love." - Henry Ward Beecher.

Happy Valentine Daze, Cancerian! After strenuous meditation about what advice would be most likely to heat up and deepen your love life, I've decided you need a stiff challenge. That's why I'm inviting you to have an epic showdown with your fears about love. What keeps you from stripping away your outmoded inhibitions and brazenly exploring the mysteries of attraction? What doubts prevent you from enjoying regular soul-to-soul gazes with your ancient future? Wouldn't you love to shed your psychic armor and summon the chutzpah to whisper in someone's ear, "I'm not afraid to ask for everything."

Happy Valentine Daze, Leo! After careful meditation about what advice might galvanize your love life, I've decided to share a thought from Jewish mystic Lawrence Kushner. "Everyone carries with them at least one piece to someone else's puzzle," he wrote in his book, Honey from the Rock. In other words, you have in your possession certain clues to your loved ones' destinies -- secrets they haven't discovered themselves. And in my astrological opinion, it is the right time and place to hand over those clues -- to make a gift of the puzzle pieces that are most needed by the people you care about. So search your depths for insights you've never communicated. Tell truths you haven't found a way to express before now. More than you know, you have the power to mobilize your companions' dreams.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Happy Valentine Daze, Virgo! After careful meditation about what advice might purify and supercharge your love life, I'm making this suggestion: For one week, concentrate all your passion and ingenuity on learning to love yourself better. Write at least one love letter and one love poem to yourself. Treat yourself to pleasures that relax your intelligence and open your wild heart. Gaze in the mirror and whisper a flood of sweet nothings. Give yourself thoughtful, surprising gifts. And finally, propose marriage to yourself and perform a wedding ceremony in which you promise to cherish and honor yourself until the end of time.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Happy Valentine Daze, Libra! I'm hereby declaring a love emergency. Right now you need love more than you need food and drink. More than that: You need to crave love with an almost crazed lyrical ferocity . . . with a reverent, burning hunger that some traditional astrologers would say Libras aren't capable of. At this pivotal moment, you've got to find a way to claim Erica Jong's subversive words as your own: "Love is everything it's cracked up to be. It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk everything, you risk even more."

"Love asks you beautiful, unanswerable questions." - Carl Sandburg. 2. "Love brings to life whatever is dead around us." - Franz Rosenzweig. 3. "Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other." - Rainer Maria Rilke. 4. "Love is the only game where two can play and both win." - Erma Freesman. 5. "Falling in love is a lot like dying. You never get to do it enough to become good at it." - My Scorpio friend Elise. 6. "Love is like a well in the wilderness where time watches over the wandering lightning." - Pablo Neruda.

"We are not the same person this year as last; nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person." - W. Somerset Maugham. 2. "People often start by falling in love, and they go on for years without realizing that love must change into some other love which is unlike the original." - Iris Murdoch. 3. "Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone; it has to be made, like bread, remade all the time, made new." - Ursula K. Le Guin. 4. "A successful marriage is an edifice that must be rebuilt every day." - Andre Maurois.

Happy Valentine Daze, Capricorn! After careful meditation about what advice might fertilize your love life, I've decided to alert you to two practical principles. The first comes to you courtesy of philosopher Rollo May: "We receive love roughly in proportion to our capacity to love." In other words: To be adored more, adore more. Your second utilitarian theorem was immortalized by the character Dicky Fox in the movie "Jerry Maguire." "If you don't love everybody," he said, "you can't sell anybody." In other words: Your most effective strategy for getting what you want is to feel tender affection for the whole world.

Happy Valentine Daze, Aquarius! After careful meditation about how I might help you perfect your love life, I've decided that all you need is my authorization to be more mercurial and improvisational. So here's a Turkish proverb for you to try on for size: "To prepare for love, learn to run through snow, leaving no footprints." Next, see how much fun you can stir up by taking to heart this Italian proverb: "Love rules without rules." Finally, Aquarius, experiment with this advice from motivational author, Sark: "Love imperfectly. Be a love idiot. Let yourself forget any love ideal."

Consider the possibility of making love with funny hats on while watching "The Simpsons," or shaving each other in the bathtub while singing tunes from Broadway musicals, or getting naked at the breakfast table and trying to throw Cheerios in each other's mouths while an instructional CD in how to speak Esperanto plays in the background.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Writing in "The Week" magazine, editor-in-chief Bill Falk reminisced about how earlier in his career he churned out three opinion columns a week for newspapers. It was tough. "The truth is," he said, "there were many weeks in which I didn¬ít have three fresh opinions of any value." These days, he added, he couldn't handle a gig like that. As he's matured, he has become suspicious of his own certainties. "Opinions are highly overrated," he concludes. "Most concern passing phenomena that, six months or six years from now, become utterly irrelevant." I propose that we make Falk your patron saint for February, Aries. The astrological omens suggest that this is a perfect moment to enjoy the humility and grace that come from nurturing compassionate ideals instead of agitated opinions.

You might want to get a history book and read up on the Greek army's defeat of the invading Persian forces at Marathon in 490 B.C. While you're at it, look into the ragtag band of Texan soldiers that won independence from Mexico at San Jacinto in 1836, or the continental army's pivotal victory over the British redcoats at Saratoga in 1777. I make these suggestions not because I think you will literally be going into battle, Taurus, but because I believe you'll soon be moved to defend and even expand your freedom. Meditating on history's successful struggles for liberation might inject an inspirational dose of martial energy into your campaign.

You're in a phase of your yearly cycle when fate will conspire to expand your perspective, get you naturally high, and turn you into an explorer. To align yourself with these cosmic tendencies, you might want to charter a supersonic MiG-25 Foxbat plane to ferry you to the upper edge of the atmosphere, where you can see the curvature of the Earth. Other good ideas: Sail over Tanzania's Serengeti Plains in a hot-air balloon; paraglide off the sea cliffs at Oahu's Makapuu Point; or take a class in shamanism at a local yoga center.

I predict that in 2004 you will become far more discriminating about what images and information you allow to enter into the holy temple of your mind. You may even put up protective barriers that keep out the media's toxic psychic wastes and your friends' bad moods. I also predict that if you don't become more discriminating, you will lose touch with your own deepest desires and end up trying to be something you're not. In conclusion, fellow Cancerian, you sure as hell better remember how naturally telepathic you are, and how easily you take on other people's feelings as if they were your own.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

After English, astrology is my second language. Like a language, it's both logical and messy; it's useful in making sense of the world, yet full of crazy-making ambiguities. At its best, astrology is a playful study of the metaphorical link between the human psyche and the sun, moon, and planets. It's not a science. It's an elegant system of symbols, an art form with a special capacity to feed the soul and educate the imagination. When regarded as a precise method for predicting the future or when used to pander to the ego's obsessions, it becomes a deserving target for satire. So there you have it, Leo. I've clarified the essential views that underlie all I do in this horoscope column, and which therefore color the relationship between you and me. Now I challenge you to do what I just did: Get together with the people you care about and articulate the fundamental assumptions that form the basis of your connection.

I rarely employ my mediumistic skills, but a host of spirits was just clamoring to address you this week. So I agreed to channel five of them, on the condition that they'd be brief and to the point. Here, then, are your advisors from the other side of the veil. First, Wernher von Braun: "Research is what you do when you don't know what you're doing." Second, A.A. Milne: "One of the advantages of being disorderly is that one is constantly making exciting discoveries." Next, Ralph Waldo Emerson: "Sometimes a scream is better than a thesis." Casey Stengel: "You're lost but you're making good time." Harry S. Truman: "If you can't convince 'em, confuse 'em."

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." So proclaimed science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke in his book Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible. To a medieval peasant, for instance, television would have appeared to be pure sorcery. Here's my corollary to Clarke's principle, Libra, just in time for your season of wonder and mystery: "Any sufficiently unexpected blessing is indistinguishable from a miracle."

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"How can one's heart and brain stand all the things that are crowded into them?" wrote nineteenth-century composer Robert Schumann. "Where do these thousands of thoughts, wishes, sorrows, joys, and hopes come from? Day in, day out, the procession goes on." Sound familiar, Scorpio? If I'm reading the astrological omens correctly, the flood that Schumann described has recently reached tsunami proportions in you. You simply can't go on like this. As the closest thing you have to a soul doctor, I regard it as my duty to prescribe massive doses of spacious silence. Quiet your thoughts, slow down your pace, and drop out of every frenetic game, at least for now.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Back in the 1980s, an old pal of mine was a girlfriend of Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry. I'm hoping if he's elected in November, she'll arrange for me to get a tryout as his astrological advisor. Who knows? Maybe he already reads this column. You there, John? Here's my counsel for you and your fellow Sagittarians. As tempting as it might be to dramatize the differences between you and your competitors, your best bet in the short run is to be an emblem of unity. Don't let your powerful moral vision get bogged down in detailing what's wrong. Instead, be passionate about beauty and truth and justice. Strong women are the key to your next success. Ask more from them than ever before. And make sure that in the midst of your noble push to the frontier, you keep nourishing your roots.

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Here's Big Secret of Life #27, crucial for your meditations in the coming weeks: Whatever you choose to focus your attention on, you will get more of it. So for example, if you often think of everything you lack and how sad you are that you don't have it, you will tend to receive abundant evidence of how true that is. If, on the other hand, you dwell on the good things that make you feel grateful to be alive, they will probably multiply. You are a great wizard, Capricorn. Why not use your powers to practice white magic on yourself instead of the other kind?

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

This will be an elephant-wearing-a-parachute-as-it-falls-through-the-sky kind of week for you, Aquarius. It'll be a successfully-shoplifting-a-Bible kind of week, a using-bottles-of-Dom-Perignon-champagne-to-put-out-a-fire kind of week, a rewriting-a-Shakespeare-play-and-selling-it-to-a-Hollywood-producer kind of week. "Improbable" should be your nickname. "Prodigious" should be your word of power. If you don't receive a magic pretzel or a golden booger from a talking raven in your dreams, I'll be shocked.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Red alert! Your behavior is beginning to have an eerie resemblance to the guy who regularly stands on a street corner in Beijing and offers himself up as a punching bag. At least he makes money from it, charging stressed-out jerks about $6 to smack him around for two minutes. But I can't see any benefit coming to you for the way you're letting yourself be abused. Please stop this perverse form of entertainment immediately. Find a better strategy for encouraging intimate contact with people.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I suggest you deal creatively with budding tension between you and your allies. Maybe you could convince them to get down on the floor with you and tussle like puppies. Or how about organizing a game of paintball? Gather together in someone's backyard and throw rocks at dishes, bottles, and old TVs. Sneak a boombox into an abandoned building and have a guerrilla dance party. Or stage a Lying Contest in which everyone competes to tell the most outrageous whoppers. Any one of these strategies will go far towards ensuring the success of joint ventures in the coming weeks.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Mathematician Paul Erdos used to describe himself as a 'machine for turning coffee into theorems,'" writes philosopher Helena Cronin at www.edge.org. "In much the same way, genes are machines for turning oxygen, water, light, zinc, calcium and iron into bears, beetles, bacteria or bluebells." According to my reading of the astrological omens, Taurus, it's a perfect time to apply this way of thinking to yourself. By the end of this week, see if you can fill in the blanks in the following sentence: "I am a machine for turning _______ into _______." In other words, define the nature of the alchemical magic you are here on Earth to carry out.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

In his masterpiece, The Divine Comedy, Gemini poet Dante Alighieri described Hell as having nine levels, each deeper in the earth and each filled with more terrible sinners than the one above it. Condemned to the eighth level, along with liars, pimps, hypocrites, and frauds, were astrologers. Yet in another book, The Convivio, Dante expressed a reverence for astrology, calling it the highest and most noble of all the sciences. Was he confused? No. He believed that though astrology is a high and noble science, some of its practitioners abuse it so dreadfully they give it a bad name. Can you do what Dante did, Gemini? Can you comfortably hold big paradoxes? I hope so. Wherever you seem to see nonsensical incongruities this week, you will need to penetrate deeper and understand better.

One of the things I like best about the Dalai Lama (our fellow Crab) is his practical approach to spirituality. An interviewer once urged him to discourse on how to cultivate lovingkindness. His Holiness said something like, "That may be too much to ask. How about if we just work on getting the 'kindness' part right?" I bring this up, Cancerian, because the astrological omens suggest that there's nothing more important for you in the coming week than to be charitable and helpful. It doesn't matter whether or not you feel charitable and helpful; be that way anyway.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In Norway, women comprise 40 percent of the government, and state-owned businesses are required to have at least 40 percent of their board seats filled by women. Private companies will have to meet this standard by 2005. In contrast, 14 percent of both the U.S. and Canadian governments is female, while American and Canadian women hold 13 percent of their countries' corporate board seats. The comparable figures for Australia: 25 percent of the government is female and 11 percent of the corporate boards. If you're thinking what I am, Leo, the governments and corporations of our countries desperately need a makeover. I nominate your tribe to lead the charge in the coming months. The astrological omens suggest that whatever gender you are, you will have an enhanced ability to promote females and feminine values in any sphere where you have influence. Start immediately, and be ingeniously relentless.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Jack Nicklaus had more major tournament wins than any other golfer in history. Skill and practice were at the heart of his athletic prowess, but on at least one occasion he tapped into a more mysterious source of power. In 1973, he got into an uncharacteristic slump that had him stumped. Then one night he had a dream in which he experimented with a new grip on his clubs. When he went to the golf course the next morning, he tried the dream's suggestion. It worked; his funk ended. I hope you'll draw inspiration from Nicklaus' example, Virgo. If you start drawing a blank in your area of expertise, be willing to call on help you'd normally never seek -- maybe even the woo-woo kind.

I summon Bast, Egyptian goddess of play, to show you how to deepen your commitment to life by having more fun. Finally, I offer a bribe to Lilith, Pagan trickster goddess, in the hope that she will steal one of your inhibitions and reveal to you the location of an erogenous zone you've neglected.

Astrologer Steven Forrest says that you Scorpios are experts at picking the locks to your unconscious minds. Many of the other signs prefer to keep their hidden depths off-limits, but you are inexhaustible explorers, always burrowing down further into the Scary Unknown to discover more clues to the Great Mystery. Libras may specialize in fostering beauty and harmony, and Cancers are masters of nurturing, but your sign is adept at busting taboos and undoing repression. I hope you're ready to live up to your reputation, because the coming weeks will be prime time for your signature brand of soul retrieval.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

The way politicians create legislation is akin to how the meat industry makes sausage. The average person might like or benefit from the result, but she'd really prefer not to know how it's done or what goes into it. Though you may not be a sausage-maker or politician, Sagittarius, I foresee a similar kind of process occupying your attention in the coming week. Your challenge will be to patch together a workable, maybe even attractive outcome by taking care of all the messy details with discreet integrity.

It's prime time for you to steal good ideas from creative innovators and use them to enhance your life. You're in an astrological phase when imitation of the right influences -- bright and beautiful and benevolent influences -- can lead to rapid progress. (Please don't imitate mediocre, mean-spirited behavior, though.) Copy the styles of fashion adepts, Capricorn. Borrow the successful methods that your competitors and cohorts have employed at their jobs. Read stories about people who are skilled at the art of living, and adopt their strategies as your own. You should always give credit to your sources, of course. The point is not to pretend you're the most original thinker in the history of the world, but to make yourself happier and freer.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In the last 50 years, America's Great Plains area has lost a third of its population, due largely to the disappearance of family farms. People are moving out in droves. Ghost towns are proliferating. From one perspective, that's sad, but from another, it's cause for celebration: The wilderness is returning in some places, and vast herds of buffalo once again roam the land. Is there any chance you'd consider initiating a comparable transformation in your inner realms during the coming weeks, Aquarius? Personally, I'd like to see some of your over-civilized parts revert to the natural state. According to my reading of the astrological omens, the cosmos agrees with me.

No, you won't have to literally stand next to a 13-foot crocodile and feed it a hunk of meat by hand while cradling a baby in your other arm. But you may very well have to be fierce and tender at the same time, or wild and protective, or daring and loving.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For many male athletes, having sex before a big game is taboo. They believe it saps their energy and hurts their chances of winning. The coach of the Chinese Olympic ping-pong team has gone even further, banning his players from falling in love. In my opinion, this approach is crazy and wrong. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, the best way for you to prime yourself for your upcoming moment of truth is by enjoying as much sweet affection and erotic delight as you dare.

Picture two people you know who seem to believe they are superior to you. Maybe they imagine they're smarter or funnier or more popular than you, and therefore think they're justified in treating you carelessly. Maybe these elitists are under the impression that because they have higher social status or more money than you, you don't deserve their focused attention. Next, Taurus, consider the idea, taught by every decent spiritual leader, that people like this have a pathologically inflated sense of self-importance. Finally, place two white roses in a special place in your home. Beneath each, lay a piece of paper on which you have written the name of the person with the superiority complex, along with the words "I am free of your judgment" and a drawing of a winged heart.

The Chinese Year of the Monkey begins this week. According to astrologer Shelly Wu
, it will be "rich in the unexpected," tweaking everyone's concept of what's normal. Ruses, half-truths, and tricks will proliferate, turning the whole year into an extended balancing act. Is anyone likely to thrive? Wu suggests it'll be those with agile intelligence, frisky imagination, and an affinity for risk and novelty. Sounds to me like she's describing the Gemini tribe. Are you ready to be a leader and role model for the rest of us?

I got an email from a person who said he was the former president of the African nation of Liberia. He said that if I helped him transfer his secret fund of $30 million from a Nigerian bank to an account in the U.S., he'd give me $9 million of it. I wrote back to him saying thanks for thinking of me, but I wouldn't take him up on his proposal. Why? I didn't tell him, but I'll tell you. Although it's true that Cancerians like myself are in an astrological phase when we can expect to benefit from other people's money and resources, maybe even in the form of a windfall, we also have to be careful not to get scammed by con artists and manipulators. The only collaborative offers we should consider are those that come from well-known sources and trusted allies.

Each of us has felt the pressure to be a more perfect lover. "Maxim" and "Cosmopolitan" magazines are two of many sources that barrage us with instructions on how to improve our techniques, expand our repertoires, and become telepathic masters of the art of dispensing pleasure. In the coming weeks, I believe you Leos will probably be subject to some of this goading. That could be good if it motivates you in a healthy way; not so good if it makes you feel defensive and self-conscious. To ensure that the mood stays light, I suggest you round up a partner who is willing to collaborate with you in a Bad Sex Festival. During the designated holiday, the two of you will intentionally engage in an orgy of awkward, contrived, and slapstick sex.

My teacher Anne Davies told a story about a negotiation between a U.S. Army general and a cannibal chief in New Guinea during World War II. The general wanted the chief to rally his tribe to help American troops fight the Japanese. The chief refused, calling the Americans immoral. The general was shocked. "We are not immoral!" he protested. "The Japanese are immoral." The cannibal chief replied, "The Japanese and Americans are equally immoral. You both kill far more people than you can eat." Let this story inspire you to take inventory of your own moral code, Virgo. Which parts of it are eternally valid, and which are shaped or distorted by the transitory beliefs of your culture and era?

Like an artist, you should push your analytical mind to the limit as you seek insight about your next creative move, then relax and wait for your intuition to sprout. Like a skilled lucid dreamer, you should formulate a good question about a dicey problem, and hold it in your mind as you fall asleep, fully expecting your dreams to reveal a brilliant solution.

As I compose this horoscope, I'm sitting in an airport bar during a layover. Something odd is happening with the 16 televisions that stretch from one end of the bar to the other. Until ten minutes ago, they'd all been showing the same basketball game. Now each is tuned to a different station. On one TV, the Blue Fairy is waving a wand over Pinocchio. On another, cops are carrying a pig out of a fountain. I'm also keeping up with the story of an African princess learning to be a card shark and a game of camel polo in an Iraqi wasteland, but that's all I can handle. Your life may soon resemble what I'm experiencing now, Sagittarius. I advise you to be like me and don't let your attention split in more than four directions.

In its literal sense, the term refers to the cultivation of flowers and vegetables in places like desert oases or frigid terrains above the tree-line. Interpreting it metaphorically, I'd guess that you have a knack for creating something out of nothing. You could probably coax cautious people into helping you nurture daring plans, or jumpstart a project that seems to have little more going for it than hope.

Writing on salon.com, Farhad Manjoo and Katharine Mieszkowski predict that e-mail spam will ultimately lead to the downfall of Internet porn. Here's the scenario they foresee. By taking advantage of the various sexual enhancements offered via spam, millions of men will become well-endowed, hard-bodied masters of lovemaking. As their ability to date and satisfy real women soars, they will lose interest in porn's virtual pleasures. Voila! Web smut will decline precipitously. I prophesy an analogous development for you in the coming weeks, Pisces. You may find you're able to manipulate one of your enemies into defeating another. Or a compulsive part of your psyche could help solve a problem created by an immature part of your psyche. Or both.

"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is one of the most popular and critically acclaimed movies released in 2003. Yet some of its fervent fans have come forward to identify its many problems with continuity. Did you notice that Frodo's scar migrates from his right cheek in one scene to his left cheek in a later scene? That's just one of over 30 flaws registered by readers of the moviemistakes.com website. I applaud this effort. I've always believed that the most useful critiques often come from people who deeply appreciate the subject they're critiquing.

Thirty-six percent of you plan to launch a new hobby, whereas 58 percent want to get rid of one of your hobbies so as to have more time for the others. While 31 percent of you are plotting to supercharge your ambitions or career, 42 percent of you are quite sure you want to work less and cultivate more leisure and luxury. Finally, 16 percent of you want more "espresso sex" -- quickies with casual acquaintances -- while 69 percent have your hearts set on deep, slow, cozy love-making with emotionally intelligent partners who crave cuddling.

In the weeks ahead, I urge you Crabs to come up with an equally nutty and brilliant strategy as you expand your empire to exotic new locales and shake off old adversaries.

"Dear Doctor Rob: I'm battling mixed emotions. On the one hand, I have frequent surges of intense compassion that make me want to build houses for poor folks. On the other hand, I'm beset by flashes of vanity that make me want to spend my money on Prada shoes and expensive jewelry rather than on trips to Third World countries to help Habitat for Humanity. Is it crazy and self-defeating to want both things? -Guilty Leo"

Dear Guilty Leo: You've summed up a dilemma that many Leos are wrestling with. My advice? Honor both your urge to express beauty and your desire to aid your fellow humans. I have a vision of you wearing a gold tiara and Prada's Sculpted d'Orsay pumps as you frame a wall for a new house in Haiti.

I predict that 2004's mysterious gifts will free you from your old self. At least one of your inhibitions will disappear. Attacks of self-consciousness will diminish in frequency and intensity. You'll realize how fun it is to rebel against your antiquated image. The only new taboo you might take on is a taboo against imitating the overused shticks that have worked for you in the past. Because of these explosive improvements in your relationship with brash spontaneity, you may be ready to acquire your porn name. Here are two suggestions about how to generate the new moniker. 1. Combine the name of your first pet with the name of the street where you lost your virginity. 2. Go to www.mypornname.com and follow the directions.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

To frame your assignment this week, I'm plundering an old horoscope from "The Onion", America's finest source of news and entertainment. "Even the mighty Ozymandias, king of kings, was brought low by time," the 'scope read. "If possible, live your life without this mysterious phenomenon." To help you carry out this difficult but rewarding task, Libra, here are a few tips: 1. In your initial attempt, don't overdo it. Spend no more than three days eluding the oppressive grip of time. 2. Hide all clocks and watches. 3. Read historical novels and watch movies set in other eras. 4. Fantasize about what you were in your previous incarnations and what you'll be in your future lives. 5. Meditate on Plato's idea that "Time is a moving image of eternity."



What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Libra? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"When in a doughnut-eating competition," writes Esquire's Cal Fussman, "press down hard on each one before biting into it. If you don't, the air inside will bloat your belly and you'll get blown out after six." I suggest you regard this as your metaphor to live by in the coming week, Scorpio. Squeeze out all the filler that might dilute your enjoyment of the really killer stuff. Don't get bogged down in empty symbolism and vacant fantasies that wear down your competitive edge.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In Greek myth, Psyche was a pure-hearted young woman whose misadventures with love got her into trouble. One day she found herself at the mercy of the goddess Aphrodite, who commanded her to sort a big heap of mixed millet, wheat, and poppy seeds into separate piles. You're now in a situation that reminds me of Psyche's predicament, Sagittarius. Is there any hope for you to complete your own version of this seemingly impossible task? Yes, there is -- especially if you garner the kind of help that Psyche did. Feeling compassion for her plight, thousands of ants swarmed to her aid, separating the seeds for her overnight. Can you call on an equivalent ally?



No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

You now have the power to design and implement a fresh version of fate for yourself. This window of opportunity won't last long, though, so I suggest you act with swift decisiveness. To guide your work, I offer two observations. The first is from Alan Kay, who conceived the laptop computer: "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." The second is my paraphrase of astrologer Hadley Fitzgerald's paraphrase of Ram Dass: "On the one hand, everything is preordained. On the other hand you have complete free will. When you truly grasp that paradox, you're no longer a slave of your conditioning."

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Aquarian singer Justin Timberlake suffered a temporary blow to his reputation last November. Speaking to ABC-TV's Diane Sawyer, his ex-lover Britney Spears implied that he is under-endowed in a part of his anatomy that most men take very seriously. It didn't take long for Timberlake's grandmother to come to his defense. "I helped raise him, and I can assure you that there's nothing wrong with him physically," 70-year-old Sadie Bomar told the press. I predict you will soon undergo a similar fall and redemption, Aquarius. Start rounding up the allies you will want to testify in your behalf.



Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"Thinking outside of the box presupposes you were able to think in it." This gem from automotive executive Bob Lutz sets the tone for your new plan of action, Pisces. In the coming week, you should concentrate on understanding your life's long-term trends from an inside-the-box perspective. Stick closely to what you actually know, as opposed to what you might speculate or fantasize. Confine your analysis to the data you can definitely confirm. Starting next week, it'll be time to think outside the box. Having prepared a strong foundation, you will have ensured that your imagination will provide useful visions when you finally unleash it.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The astrological omens say it's a favorable time for you to seek greater exposure and get yourself noticed. But there are relatively bad ways and good ways to proceed. Do not, for example, distribute nude photos of yourself over the Internet, proclaim your mad love for an unavailable genius in a full-page newspaper ad, or bust up a meeting with a screaming tirade about how brilliant your ideas are and how stupid everyone else's are. Instead, try this: Spruce up your physical appearance, stoke your charisma, improve your packaging, and hire a marketing consultant.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Sixty-six-year-old Taurus actor Jack Nicholson is a paragon of receptivity. "I'm dying to have my mind changed," he told "Esquire" magazine. "I'm probably the only liberal who read Treason, by Ann Coulter. I like listening to everybody. This is the elixir of life." Nicholson's refreshing declaration should be your words to live by in the next couple of weeks, Taurus: It's your astrological season of expansion and experimentation. Don't just grudgingly agree to open your eyes and have your theories challenged. Learn to love the uncanny stretching sensation.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I believe you should draw your inspiration this week from the British graffiti artist Bansky. He bought an unremarkable landscape painting at a flea market and glued a police "Do Not Cross" tape onto it. Then, disguised as a shuffling old man, he smuggled it into London's prestigious Tate Museum and managed to hang it on a wall, where for a while it was regarded as a legitimate work of art by visitors and staff alike. Is there some place in your life that needs a comparable touch of prankish levity, Gemini? Any overly dignified or formal environment that could use the healing touch of a gentle lampoon?

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The oldest woman to have a number one pop song was Deborah Harry, born under the sign of Cancer. She conquered the UK charts with "Maria" when she was 53 years old. The world's oldest astronaut was another Crab, John Glenn, who flew on the space shuttle when he was 77. Now you, too, have a chance to make history through success in an activity that most people might regard as impossible or inappropriate for someone your age. Don't let anyone shame you into shrinking from the challenge, whether you're 25 and thinking of entering a bubble-gum blowing contest or 65 and considering the possibility of windsurfing down the Amazon River.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I really like a lot about "Suga Suga," a song by hip-hop artist Baby Bash. The rhythm is crafty, the lead guitar line tasty, and the chorus melody infectious. I love Baby Bash's sinuous rap cadences and Franky J's gorgeous singing. The lyrics of "Suga Suga," on the other hand, are vapid and vulgar. And the video of the song is morally idiotic, depicting men leering at a succession of surgically sculpted women who dress and preen like android porn stars. Is there anything in your life that you both love and hate, as I do "Suga Suga," Leo? I'm betting the answer's an intense "yes!" What should you do about it? Try to ignore the part you're allergic to, or else abandon the entire enterprise altogether? Don't make a decision until at least February 1.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Pope Jean Paul II has canonized 477 new saints, exceeding the total of the last 86 popes combined. His secret? Previously, candidates had to have performed three miracles, whereas now it's two at most. Other saint-makers have been inspired by the Pope's example. The Church of the Subgenius is creating an average of 2,100 new saints per year (non-Catholic variety), while the Discordians are close behind with 1,875. I'm embarrassed to say that my own faith, the Temple of Sacred Uproar and Rowdy Blessings, has been lagging far behind -- until now, that is. In honor of the miraculous feats of beauty, truth, and love that "Free Will Astrology"-reading Virgos have been pulling off lately, I hereby bestow sainthood on every one of you. You may hereafter put a "St." in front of your name.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Accountants are experts about money that doesn't belong to them. A scholar may read the texts of mystical spiritual traditions but not be able to enter into the sublime states of consciousness described therein. Please refrain from getting into a relationship like this with the resources you need, Libra. Don't just study them; own them. Seek up-close experiential immersion, not conceptual understanding from a distance.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Creativity comes in a wide variety of forms, from the unruly originality of an avant-garde music composer to the brilliant tactics of a four-year-old manipulating his parents into buying him more toys. The creativity you will specialize in during the coming weeks, Scorpio, is a cross between that of an engineer building a bridge over a steep gorge and a gadfly who prods two ancient enemies into sitting down to talk. It will fit the description articulated by writer William Plomer: "Creativity is the power to connect the seemingly unconnected."

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Sagittarian Pudge Rodriguez is one of the best catchers in professional baseball. Last October, he played a major role in helping the Florida Marlins win the World Series. His contract expired at the end of the season, however, and he was insulted when the Marlins proposed a future salary of only $8 million per year, a 20 percent reduction from the $10 million he earned in 2003. He rejected the Marlins' offer, and made his services available to other teams. Though I admire his fierce pride, I urge the rest of you Sagittarians to be less demanding. If you're offered 8 million of anything -- hugs, gold stars, M&M;'s, dollars -- instead of the 10 million you wanted, definitely take the 8 million.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Following Castro's revolution in 1959, 11-year-old Carlos Eire was exiled forever from his beloved homeland of Cuba. Raised in America, he became a Yale professor, but never lost his yearning for paradise lost. His recent memoir, Waiting for Snow in Havana, recounts his cherished memories. "In the past 38 years," he wrote, "I've seen 8,917 clouds in the shape of the island of Cuba." What's your equivalent, Capricorn? A missing treasure you're reminded of whenever you gaze upon the ripples in a lake? A fugitive dream that floats across your mind's eye as you're falling asleep? I predict you will be united with it in 2004. A crucial pointer will arrive soon. Watch the clouds.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In a recent speech, "Boondocks" comic strip creator Aaron McGruder said that if liberals want to regain power in America, they'll have to learn to be meaner. Leftist singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco echoed the theme in an interview in "Indie Culture" magazine. "It's our job to help and inspire each other," she mused, "but I don't think that all my songs have to be about nature and children and love and hugging. There are ways of helping people by expressing anger." I almost always advise you to err on the side of compassion and kindness, Aquarius. But this is a perfect moment to take McGruder's and DiFranco's words to heart. It's crucial that you find ways to creatively and constructively channel your sacred rage at what's wrong in your world.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In hopes of helping you fully claim the rising levels of goodies and self-confidence that are now available, I urge you to sing or chant the following rant ten times a day for the next two weeks. "All I ever wanted in life was to make a difference, be worshipped like a god, conquer the universe, travel the world, meet interesting people, find the missing link, fight the good fight, live for the moment, seize each day, make a fortune, know what really matters, end world hunger, vanquish the dragon, be super popular but too cool to care, be master of my own fate, embrace my destiny, feel as much as I can feel, give too much, and love everything." (Thanks to Tatsuya Ishida at www.sinfest.net for dreaming up this set of affirmations.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I saw my Aries friend Alexis yesterday. "You're even more festive than the last time I saw you," I told her. She had on red silk pants, a burgundy cashmere sweater, silver scarf, black snakeskin boots, and beaded black tunic. I noticed several new piercings and a Hindu-style red dot on her forehead just above her eyes. She also happened to be carrying her snake, which was wrapped around her arm. "The older I get, the freer I am to hide nothing about how I really feel," she replied. "It's not even rebellion any more -- it's generosity. I have this sense that the world needs me to express my most extravagant self." I nominate Alexis to be your patron saint in 2004, Aries.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

How have you measured your progress over the years, Taurus? Report cards, diplomas, certificates, and plaques? Pay raises, VIP friends, new titles, and nicer cars? Or have your benchmarks of success been subtler, like rising levels of self-love, a growing capacity for intimacy, more robust health, and friendships with people who bring out the best in you? Whatever signs you have relied on, I ask you to set them aside in 2004. Empty your mind completely so that you will be fully receptive to fresh intuitions about how to evaluate your ongoing evolution.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

My orphan friend Elektra has no idea when she was born and therefore doesn't know what sign she is. While there are drawbacks to this, it has advantages, too. She celebrates her birthday once every month, for instance. She also reads all twelve of my horoscopes each week and heeds only the ones she likes. I suggest you adopt her approach in 2004, Gemini. To do so would make perfect astrological sense. This week you could act like an assertive, single-minded Aries. Next week you might want to be an organized and disciplined Capricorn. By mid-January you could thrive on playing the part of a willful, mysterious Scorpio. All the world will be your stage in 2004. You should relish the host of roles available to you.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Cancerian actress Pamela Anderson has become a Sunday school teacher who reads the Bible to kids. While some might wonder if the former Playboy centerfold has reformed and others might call her a hypocrite, she told the BBC there's no incongruity between her sexy image and her faith in God. I urge you to be inspired by Anderson's example in 2004, my fellow Crabs. You have the possibility of playing two different roles that many people imagine are incompatible. Who cares what they think? You can definitely go both ways without being either a contradiction or a fake.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Three weeks in a row, a Leo woman in Romania watched a TV horoscope show that assured her she would soon receive a windfall. No free money ever arrived, though, so she lodged a protest with a local consumer protection agency. Officials there in turn advised the horoscope show's programmers to issue a disclaimer stating that their predictions may not be 100 percent accurate. I suppose I should make a similar announcement here, even though I'm pretty sure the prophecy I'm about to make will be fulfilled. If you vow to work smarter (not harder) and shed illusory hopes that free money might come your way unexpectedly, you will get richer quicker in 2004.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

One of your most wonderful qualities is your aptitude for helping people. It's also the part of your nature that is most likely to be abused by charming narcissists and charismatic manipulators. But in 2004, you will have a knack for freeing yourself from these oppressors. You'll be able to spot potential new ones from a mile away, and you'll know how to break the hold that the old ones have on you. Take this pledge now: "I will serve only the smart, effective people who also serve me."

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I invite you to meditate on death not as the end of your actual physical life, but as a metaphor for killing off beliefs and habits that are outworn burdens. Once you've come to understand that this kind of death is an ally you'd be wise to have by your side all the time, you'll be able to enjoy the rest of this horoscope. Seriously, Libra. Don't read on until you are convinced that the "good death" I described is an asset you want. Ready? Your assignment in the first two-thirds of 2004 is to die at least once every month. If you do it right -- that is to say, with grace and flair -- you will be blessed with a glorious rebirth by next October.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Scorpio actress Chloe Sevigny has a unique relationship with the Ten Commandments. Judging from the fact that she's a Catholic who goes to Mass, she seems to regard them as important. On the other hand, she told a Rolling Stone reporter, "I interpret the Ten Commandments pretty loosely. Actually, I interpret them in any way that helps me." Sevigny's approach won't work for you in 2004, Scorpio. If you want to align yourself harmoniously with cosmic forces, you should either take your moral code very seriously, or else abandon it altogether and find a new one you can totally commit to.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Thirty-six-year-old Dale Peck is an author with an extremely high sense of self-worth. He has written several novels that he describes as "among the best books published in the last ten years." He has also penned many book reviews replete with caustic and derisive dismissals of modern literary giants, including Faulkner, Nabokov, DeLillo, Barthelme, and Pynchon. He calls James Joyce's Ulysses "diarrheic flow," and rips Rick Moody as "the worst writer of his generation." I bring Peck to your attention, Sagittarius, because I believe you should study him as a model of both what to do and what not to do in 2004. Aspire to achieve his abundant confidence, yes, but root it in self-love, not a contemptuous sense of superiority towards others.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

San Francisco Chronicle columnist Tom Stienstra writes about the great outdoors. He sometimes makes long-term weather forecasts by analyzing natural phenomena like the quality of red onion skins, the thickness of winter coats on coyotes and deer, and the difference between sea and land temperatures in coastal areas. I, too, like to factor in clues like this with my astrological evaluations. To gauge your prospects for the coming months, I've gathered information on eagle nests, the horns of mountain goats, and cloud patterns over wild places with no roads. I conclude that for you to be in maximum harmony with cosmic rhythms in 2004, you should spend a lot of time wandering in the great outdoors.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

As an Aquarius, you have a tendency to be ahead of your time. Sometimes that's an asset, like when you readily embrace good changes that less adventurous people are afraid of. But on other occasions it's a liability, like when you figure out solutions to budding problems that no one else is even aware of yet. I believe this kind of disjunction will happen with regularity in 2004. Your first reaction may be to feel frustrated. "I have the answer," you'll feel like screaming at your cohorts, "to the question you people desperately need to ask!" Here's some advice about how to avoid this crazy-making situation: Accept the fact that it will be just as important to sell your brilliant solution as to come up with it in the first place.

After having dined at the Urasawa sushi bar in Los Angeles, I'm prepared to give you advice about your love life in 2004. It should have a lot in common with the sake I drank there: delicate yet potent, so unique as to be almost (but not quite) strange, enjoyed most when sipped slowly, and made from individually polished grains of rice grown next to sacred groves of sakaki trees and fed by an ancient underground spring.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

In his book, The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should, Like, Care, John McWhorter says he prefers the energetic rants of poetry slams to the "doggedly flat rainy day poems" of more academic writers. On the other hand, the spoken word stuff rarely ventures beyond "alienation and scolding," which limits its beauty and power. "The vast weight of human artistic achievement was not created in indignation," he notes. Please remember that, Aries. Your anger will be good and strong in 2004. It will help you tap into a lot of constructive creativity. But you should resist the temptation to let it influence everything you do.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"When you're following your energy and doing what you want all the time," says New Age author Shakti Gawain, "the distinction between work and play dissolves." I'd like to add that you can go a long way towards blending work and play without having to reach Gawain's impossibly high standard of all the time. It would be revolutionary to "follow your energy and do what you want" just 20 percent more than your current levels. And the astrological omens for 2004 suggest that you can easily exceed that. I say shoot for 30 percent, Taurus. Experiment with creating rich new meanings of the term "labor of love."

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

One way or another, you'll be coming home in 2004, Gemini. Maybe you'll finally locate the sanctuary that brings out the best in you -- the power spot where you feel pure and real and true. Maybe you'll create the community you've always dreamed of or else join a network that connects you to resources that have always been off-limits. Perhaps you'll go explore the land where your ancestors lived and died for many generations, or maybe you'll make a pilgrimage to a storied place that holds the key to a mystery you desperately need to clarify. And maybe you'll do all of the above.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"The great lesson from the true mystics is that the sacred is in the ordinary, that it is to be found in one's daily life, in one's neighbors, friends, and family, in one's back yard." So said psychologist Abraham Maslow. Of course that's always true, but in 2004 it will be far more true for you than ever before. You won't have to travel to exotic paradises to drum up life-changing epiphanies, Cancerian. You won't have to hunt for miracles in all-night revels at the edge of reality. All the amazement you'll need will glide right up to you while you're washing dishes or taking a walk or buying peanut butter.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Using FBI crime data, a research company determined that Amherst, New York is the safest city in America, followed by Brick Township, New Jersey and Mission Viejo, California. My analysis of the astrological data for 2004 suggests that your sign, Leo, will be safest in all the zodiac. You're least likely to be a victim of crime, abusive relationships, health problems, and bad ideas. I think you should take maximum advantage of this coming grace period. What adventures would you set out on if you knew you had little to fear? What brave decisions would you risk? What "forbidden" pleasures would you sample?

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Some of the finest minds I've ever known have belonged to Virgos. I've benefited greatly from your tribe's analytical power. Though my gig as an astrology columnist may suggest I favor magical thinking over the logical kind, I am in fact a great admirer of the scientific method and objective reasoning. Having said all that, I can in good conscience tell you to trust your passion way more than usual in 2004. Cut out this quote from Ray Bradbury and carry it in your wallet: "If we listened only to our intellect, we'd never have a love affair or friendship. We'd never go into business. Well, that's nonsense. Sometimes you've got to jump off cliffs and grow your wings on the way down."

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Amazon.com has begun to do with books what Napster did to music: give them away free online. Along with 120,000 other books, you can now read the entire text of my memoir, The Televisionary Oracle, without buying it. My first reaction to this was a clenched "Aaarrrggghhh! My beloved creation, which I slaved over for years, will no longer generate any income!" Soon I moved to a new attitude, Buddhist-style non-attachment: "Everything in this world is transitory. Why worry about what I can't control?" Later my view evolved still further, spurred by reports that Amazon expects this innovation to actually boost book sales. "Maybe this is a good thing," I decided. The process I went through, Libra, will be similar to your own in 2004. I predict that an apparent loss will lead to an unexpected gain.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In last week's horoscope, I predicted that in 2004 you will have many exuberant exploits that spread joy and laughter throughout the land. Now it's time to reveal your other key assignment for the coming months: to seek out experiences that rouse reverence and awe. Do you have any heroes, Scorpio? Do you know anyone whose noble grace or healing genius takes your breath away? Are there any gorgeous works of art or natural wonders that inspire you to fall to your knees and shout "Glory in the highest!"? You need to put yourself regularly in the presence of marvels like that. For extra credit, create adventures in which you feel both worshipful adoration and rowdy pleasure.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You'll have some heroic assignments in 2004, Sagittarius. They will challenge you to be both ingeniously creative and rigorously disciplined. Can you think way outside of the box without alienating those who prefer to live inside of the box? Are you open-minded enough to get fired up about experimental innovations, but authoritative enough to hammer out pragmatic compromises? Do you have the flexibility to be both a maverick and a leader?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Mountaintop perspectives will be your specialty in the coming months, Capricorn. You will be invited again and again to gaze at the big picture. To make sure you keep going with the cosmic flow, keep asking yourself the question, "What would the far-seeing, adventure-loving part of me do right now?" Your weekly schedule should always be spiced with tasks that serve your master plan. Now here's your thought for the week, which can also serve as your thought for the year: "When we stop learning and merely act from the knowledge we have accumulated, disorder comes." --J. Krishnamurti.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Two thousand four will be the Year of Games for you. Here are helpful guidelines, courtesy of programmer Garry Hamilton. 1. If the game is rigged so you can't win, find another game or invent your own. 2. If you're not winning because you don't know the rules, learn the rules. 3. If you know the rules but aren't willing to follow them, there's either something wrong with the game or you need to change something in yourself. 4. Don't play the game in a half-baked way. Either get all the way in or all the way out. 5. It shouldn't be necessary for others to lose in order for you to win. If others have to lose, re-evaluate the game's goals.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I'm hopeful that 2004 will be the year you renounce your habit of taking on the roles of scapegoat and martyr. In fact, let's launch a campaign to do just that right now. The best way to begin might be to engage in one last self-mocking wallow. Tape a "Kick Me" or "Use Me" sign on your back. Attach a chain to a doormat and wear it around your neck like a big necklace. Invite friends to blame you for everything that's wrong in their lives. Take the whole shtick to the limit, in other words, Pisces. Feel how ridiculous it is. Encourage it to burn itself out in a blaze of absurd glory. And then walk away from it forever.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Happy Holy Daze, Aries! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What symbolic item might inspire you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2004? I decided on the book Marathon Training For Dummies, by Tere Stouffer Drenth. It's not because I think you should literally gear up to run a 26-mile race during the coming year. Rather, I'd like to get you in a frame of mind in which you're always prepping yourself for lengthy projects that will require stamina, resourcefulness, and strategic thinking.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The love song is an endangered species. Lots of modern musicians do sex songs and pain songs and rage songs, but few are inclined to craft tunes in which they declare their passionate affection and describe it in all its nuanced uniqueness. As a result, Taurus, you will most likely be out of sync with the tenor of the times in 2004. Your heart will be stirred as it hasn't been in many moons. Even if you're not a professional vocalist, you may often feel longings to express your lush emotions in song. If I were going to get you a holiday gift, it would be a compilation CD filled with the greatest love songs of the last sixty years.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Happy Holy Daze, Gemini! I predict that you'll dive deeper in 2004. You will cheerily plunge in over your head as you pursue the noble goal of getting to the bottom of things. Exploring murky waters shouldn't faze you because you'll have a sixth sense that's equivalent to being able to see in the dark. In looking around for a holiday gift you could give yourself to encourage these extraordinary predilections, I came across a yellow submarine for sale on the Internet. Amazingly, it's named the "Gemini." For more info, see  www.subeo.com.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

You think you know what chocolate is all about? You don't. The tastes you find in M&M;'s and Hershey's Kisses comprise a tiny percentage of chocolate's total flavor spectrum. A few vanguard connoisseurs are beginning to awaken to the glorious diversity. New York now boasts several gourmet boutiques that offer the kind of variety characteristic of wine and coffee specialty stores. If I could get you a holiday gift, Cancerian, it would be a sampling of these exotic chocolates. Maybe if you realized what you've been missing in this one area, you'd also get more aggressive about pursuing a wider array of other fine pleasures in 2004. And that would be in alignment with the astrological omens.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Happy Holy Daze, Leo! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What would best get you ready for 2004? What symbolic offering might motivate you to take maximum advantage of the astrological opportunities ahead? And the answer is: dirt; to be exact, one cup of good, rich soil from each of the seven places in the world where you feel most at home. With these containers of sacred ground displayed on your altar, you might be inspired to come way down to earth: to be more practical, detail-oriented, skilled at compromise, and hard-working than you've ever been.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Happy Holy Daze, Virgo! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What symbolic offering might inspire you to be in closest alignment with the cosmic currents in 2004? I decided on a framed photo of a Great White Shark, which is the only sea creature that has no natural enemies. I expect that you will likewise have few adversaries and obstacles in the coming months. The Great White is also at the top of the food chain, and while you may not ascend all the way to the pinnacle of your local hierarchy, you should definitely climb higher.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Happy Holy Daze, Libra! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What symbolic item might help you take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2004? Here's what I came up with: the film, "Destino," a collaboration between surrealist painter Salvador Dali and Walt Disney's team of animators. Though the joint artistic effort began soon after Disney and Dali met in 1945, it wasn't completed until recently. In that sense alone it should be inspiring, because you, too, will be striving to revive an old dream in the coming months. Your near future will resemble a Disney-Dali creation in another way: There'll be a convergence of what's weird and what's popular, what's extraordinary and normal, what's adventurous and cute.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The coming year will be a favorable time to double your commitment to rowdy fun. I encourage you to attend more parties than usual and always be on the lookout for how you can energize social occasions with acts of joyous abandon. You'll also be wise to infuse even your intimate encounters with boisterous amusements. Therefore, Scorpio, please consider doing more handstands on barstools in 2004. Try dancing on tabletops with only some of your clothes on, slurping right out of punch bowls, starting food fights, and knocking over lamps while spontaneously making love. If I were going to get you a symbolic holiday gift this year, it might be a chandelier, conveying to you my hope that you will bring back the lost art of swinging on chandeliers.

Happy Holy Daze, Sagittarius! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What would best get you ready for 2004? What might help you take maximum advantage of the astrological opportunities ahead? And the answer is: a $20-million, 30-second ad about you and your services, to be broadcast on TV during the Super Bowl next February. You need a splashy marketing gambit like that to get the word out. It is high time for you to shine in the spotlight at center stage.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Happy Holy Daze, Capricorn! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gifts for you. What symbolic items might inspire you to take maximum advantage of the cosmic currents in 2004? I've decided on three things: 1. binoculars, which I hope will encourage you to constantly seek closer looks at distant sights; 2. mountain-climbing equipment, which I hope will encourage you to spend more time outside, get naturally high, and look at the world from lofty perspectives; 3. lightweight, quick-drying, anti-bacterial underwear designed to be washed every night as you travel. I hope they'll encourage you to leave behind heavy baggage and complicated expectations as you make frequent forays out of your comfort zone.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Your holiday celebrations wouldn't be much fun if there were no such thing as fungi. One member of the fungus family, yeast, is essential to brewing alcoholic beverages, baking pastries, and turning cocoa beans into chocolate. Another type of fungus is crucial to the growth of most Christmas trees. They grow well only because of the symbiotic relationship between their roots and certain mushrooms. Wrapping paper would of course also be scarce without the mushrooms' assistance. Now that you've heard these facts, Aquarius, I hope you'll decide to make the fungus your good luck charm in 2004. It will remind you to hold in high esteem the hidden forces and unsung people that will be constantly working behind the scenes in your behalf. This will be the Year of Secret Helpers. (Thanks to Tom Volk's "Fungus of the Month" website.)

Happy Holy Daze, Pisces! I've been meditating on the perfect holiday gift for you. What would best get you ready for 2004? What might motivate you to take maximum advantage of the astrological opportunities ahead? I've decided to give you a small, circumscribed part of the Pacific Ocean. It's a cubic mile located between longitude 110 and 111 degrees west and between latitude 10 and 11 degrees south. I'm hoping that this manageable, well-defined section of the primal sea will inspire you to create better boundaries as you deal with your own oceanic emotions; to be more judiciously dramatic and less overflowingly melodramatic.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Six miles from Maui is a Hawaiian island that tourists never visit -- Kaho'olawe. The U.S. Navy seized it in 1941 and used it as a target range for decades. After years of protests by Native Hawaiians, the Navy finally stopped bombing and began a clean-up campaign. Last month it formally turned control of the island over to the rightful owners. "You can get a feel on Kaho'olawe of what it was like to live on Hawaii at the time of our ancestors," says Native Hawaiian Davianna McGregor. "We can practice our traditions there without it being a tourist attraction. It's one place we can go to be in communion with our natural life forces." Every one of us has a personal version of Kaho'olawe, Aries: a part of our psyche that has been stolen or colonized by hostile forces. It's a perfect moment for you to take back yours.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Aries. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Three billion years ago, the Earth's original single-cell organisms thrived in a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. As a byproduct of their metabolism, however, they released an abundant amount of oxygen. It was a pollutant that ultimately made their environment uninhabitable for them, though it prepared the way for the oxygen-breathers that now dominate the planet. Now let's meditate on how this might be a useful metaphor for you, Taurus. Is there any "pollutant" produced by the person you were in the past that could be valuable for the person you will become in the future?

Want more clues, Taurus? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Vanessa Lucero, a 14-year-old New Mexico girl, is your role model this week. In October, she was named homecoming princess at her high School. On the weekend of her reign, she also played in a game for the football team, becoming the first female in school history to score a touchdown. During the span of a few glorious hours, she wore both a helmet and a tiara. Like Vanessa, you Geminis now have the potential to notch triumphs in two separate spheres using different sets of skills.

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Gemini? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The world's most famous Cancer, U.S. President George W. Bush, has described his relationship with newspapers this way: "I glance at the headlines just to kind of get a flavor for what's moving. I rarely read the stories, and get briefed by people who read the news themselves." Please don't imitate Bush's approach as you gather information in the coming days, my fellow Crabs. It's crucial that you never rely on third-hand reports as you penetrate to the root of every unfolding plot. You know how journalists sometimes bury really interesting and mysterious details at the end of their stories? That's what life will do.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Cancerian? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

After a study found that a majority of heterosexual men dive into sexual intercourse without any warm-up, Britain launched its first annual National Foreplay Day last July. How about if we borrow this holiday for your use, Leo? I'm not saying you've been remiss in your approach to maximizing erotic pleasure, but there's always room for improvement. Besides, from an astrological perspective this is a favorable time to expand your mastery of the arts of love. In fact, let's borrow another British holiday, National Orgasm Day. I hereby proclaim this Universal Foreplay and Orgasm Week for all Leos.

Want to explore the coming week even further, Leo? Dig deeper? Feel stronger? Consider tuning in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

This week's horoscope features the poetry of U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Delivered at a news briefing, it provides a perfect frame for the current state of your fate. "As we know," he said, "there are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns. That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don't know we don't know." You, Virgo, are very close to discovering at least two of your personal unknown unknowns. (For more poetry by Rumsfeld, check out the book Pieces of Intelligence : The Existential Poetry of Donald H. Rumsfeld, edited by Hart Seel.)

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Virgo? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

My Libran friend John was constantly harassed and shamed by his father over trivial issues when he was growing up. A typical scenario often occurred in the kitchen as John scanned the refrigerator for an appetizing snack. "You idiot!" his dad would scream at him. "How many millions of times have I told you not to hold the refrigerator door open so long?" John would immediately close the door and leave in silence, feeling humiliated and hungry. When he told me this story today, here's what I advised him to do: Keep his refrigerator door open for as long as it takes to wipe away the pain of his father's inane cruelty. To the rest of you Libras I say: Rebel in a way that will heal a wound from childhood.

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Libra? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Like every species, harmful microbes evolve over time in response to environmental conditions. Syphilis, for example, was far more lethal and fast-spreading 500 years ago. It killed its human victims relatively quickly, which diminished its ability to proliferate in new hosts. Ultimately, a milder variety developed to ensure the survival of the species. An infected person lived longer and could spread the syphilis strain further. I propose that you adopt this model as a metaphor for dealing with your bad moods, aberrant behavior, and temporary attacks of insanity. Cultivate your relationship with the milder forms of these pathologies, confident that this will make the nastier versions obsolete.

No one knows you better than you do, Scorpio. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

I saw the Acura commercial on TV tonight. The car was driving through a remote high desert. Through the magic of computer graphics, it seemed to be creating the road as it moved, laying down paved blacktop where before there was only dirt. I thought of you immediately, Sagittarius. You're in a comparable situation, right? There's no path where you're going, so you'll have to make it for yourself as you proceed.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Capricorn actress Drea de Matteo's career is in full bloom. Besides her regular role on HBO's "The Sopranos," she has been in nine movies since 2001. To what should we attribute her success? Lots of talent, for one. A playwright mother who exposed her to the theater early, for two. During her recent appearance on Carson Daly's "Last Call" TV show, she revealed a ballsy magic that constitutes a third ingredient. She told Daly she keeps the testicles of her Great Dane, which she had neutered a few years ago, in a jar of formaldehyde by her bed. Take inspiration from her example, Capricorn. It's high time you acknowledged the fact that skill and hard work may not be enough to get you where you want to go; you also need mojo.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Capricorn. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"So many of us are not in our bodies, really at home and vibrantly present there," says dancer Gabrielle Roth. "Nor are we in touch with the basic rhythms that constitute our bodily life. We live outside ourselves -- in our heads, our memories, our longings -- absentee landlords of our own estate." Does any of that description fit you, Aquarius? If so, here's good news: The months ahead will provide you with the best opportunity ever to come home to your body, to inhabit it with robust awareness and gratitude. And it all starts now. To show you're ready, find a place to be alone in the dark, put on music that moves you, and dance yourself all the way back into your body.

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Aquarius? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Each week I give my readers homework. A recent assignment was to finish the sentence, "The one thing that keeps me from being myself is __________." Many respondents filled in the blank with "my fears." Other common answers were "lack of money," "my spouse," and "my obsession with everyone's images of me." But the best contribution was from Ann-Marie at www.getunderground.com. She said, "The one thing that keeps me from being myself is people's reluctance to lick patent leather." By not taking herself too seriously, she showed that nothing can keep her from being herself. Drawing inspiration from her sterling example, Pisces, finish this sentence in a more humorous way than you normally might: "The one thing that keeps me from being myself is __________." 

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Pisces? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

British performance artist Mark McGowan was offended by the widespread international mockery of his country's cuisine. In protest, he decided to express his pride by turning himself into an English breakfast. A store near London let him live in the front window for 12 days, during which time he sat in a vat of baked beans with a crown of sausages on his head and a deep-fried potato wedge lodged in each nostril. In the coming week, Aries, the astrological omens suggest you should be as bold and imaginative as McGowan in support of your own pet cause.

Want more clues, Aries? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

If typical, you will make love about 2,500 times in your lifetime. But maybe only 25 of those encounters will offer this week's blend of physical rapture and spiritual breakthrough. I'm not exaggerating, Taurus. The cosmos is inviting you to be the recipient of a mind-expanding peak experience or two. To take maximum advantage, be as innocent and open as you dare. Find the place in you where lust and compassion overlap. (P.S. You don't necessarily need a partner to enjoy these gifts. If you're single, shed any shame you have about solo sex and explore its mysteries.)

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Taurus? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Every poll I've seen asserts that far more women than men make use of astrology. It was only a matter of time before macho dudes discovered this and sought to exploit it. One such guy is Gemini Pat Burrell, a baseball player for the Philadelphia Phillies. In an interview in a men's magazine, he marveled at how much success he'd had on first dates by talking about horoscopes. In the coming weeks, his experience will apply to you -- only more so. No matter what gender or sexual preference you are, discussing astrology will be a surefire way to advance romance. For that matter, initiating conversations about any subject that gives a mythic flavor to intimate matters will stimulate the flow of sexy vibes. You might want to check out Skymates: Love, Sex and Evolutionary Astrology, by Jodie and Steven Forrest.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I'm worried you'll suffer an attack of shyness or modesty this week. Instead of pushing to get exactly what you want, you might dream up lame excuses to explain to yourself why it's OK if you don't get exactly what you want. Or you may be satisfied too easily and retreat to your hiding place before fate has a chance to bestow the fullness of its unexpected blessings on you. Please fight off this trend, Cancerian. Give your inner wimp a dozen roses and send your inner warrior out to collect your just deserts.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Pop quiz! 1. You are so attractive these days that you risk rousing the envy of people whose support you need. True or false? 2. You now have the ability to change the weather merely by wiggling your eyebrows or wrinkling your nose. True or false? 3. Since you are so exceptionally fertile -- with an equal power to supercharge the growth of beautiful blooms and nasty weeds -- you will have to be very discriminating about where you point your mojo. True or false? 4. You are unusually susceptible to being manipulated through flattery. True or false?

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The Chilean Congress has recently considered a bill that would mandate afternoon siestas for all workers. As a nap activist who has lobbied long and hard for everyone to get more dream time, I cheered this revolutionary proposal. Now I'm asking you, Virgo, to join me in the struggle to gain even more sleepers' rights. What specific action can you take? For starters, spend more time asleep and dreaming in the coming week than you ever have -- and don't let any workaholic, sleep-deprived cranky-head shame you for it. Your productivity will rise; I guarantee it. (P.S. The astrological moment is also ripe for you to rise up against the tyranny of Type A overachievers who think everyone should be as addicted to stress as they are.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Octopuses have eyes that can focus on two different scenes simultaneously. In some species one eye is specialized to see things in the murky depths while the other eye concentrates on sights in sunlit waters. I suggest you make this creature your power animal in the coming week. To keep apprised of the complex plots that will be unfolding around you in every direction, you will need the equivalent of the octopus's vision. 

No one knows you better than you do, Libra. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

For a mere $99.95, I could remove the curse you're suffering from. But I'd feel bad about taking your money when you could get rid of the damn thing yourself. In fact, why don't you do just that, and send yourself a check for $99.95? Here's all you have to do. Step one: Visualize an object that symbolizes the accursed influence. Picture yourself throwing it into a furnace. Step two: Visualize the person you feel is most responsible for the curse. Imagine that one end of a rope is tied around your waist and the other end around the person. Picture yourself cutting through the rope with a chainsaw as you call out, "You have no friggin' power over me!" Step three: Repeat steps one and two twice a day for 11 days. Step four: On the eleventh day, laugh so long and hard that you fall on the floor and cry tears of joyful release.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Master astrologer Steven Forrest believes you Sagittarians often thrive on learning things the hard way. I agree. Here are my three explanations of why this is so. 1. One of your main tasks in life is to cultivate wisdom, and you'll never accomplish that if everything comes too easily for you. 2. To maintain your mental hygiene, you need to push regularly into the unknown, where the rules for success are as yet unwritten. 3. You are sometimes susceptible to being dogmatic, which can interfere with your ability to discern simple, obvious, up-to-the-minute truths. To shock you out of your tunnel vision, your higher self needs to trick you into making interesting mistakes.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Sagittarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Slashing through undergrowth and counting poop is an expensive, time-consuming, dirty, hot, and nasty business," said Dr. Richard Ruggiero of the African Elephant Conservation Fund. Quoted by Andrew Revkin in the New York Times, he was talking about studying forest elephants that are threatened with extinction. But I immediately thought of you when I read that, Capricorn. It's a good metaphor for what's happening in your life. An important and beautiful aspect of your animal nature is in peril, and the only way to save it may be for you to do work that fits Ruggiero's description.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Psychotherapy obsesses on what's wrong with people and gives short shrift to what's right. The manual of the profession is a 943-page text called the DSM-IV that identifies scores of pathological states but no healthy ones. I often complain about this tragic fact and ask my readers to help me compile material for a proposed Anti-DSM-IV, a compendium of all the positive, noble, feel-good categories. One reader, Alka Bhargava, has suggested a condition that you Aquarians will be able to achieve regularly this week. He calls it "Joyful Poignance," and describes it like this: "The ability to be buoyantly joyful while remaining aware of the sadness, injustices, ancient wounds, and future fears that form the challenges in an examined life."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You might enjoy Pearl Cleage's novel Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do. It's got soulful characters, a strong social consciousness, and a dramatic mix of suffering and redemption. But you don't have to read the book to carry out the advice in this week's horoscope. All you have to do is write your own personal version of "Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do" -- a two-page stream-of-consciousness essay is fine -- and then go out and start actually doing the things you've described therein.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Pisces. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Three decades ago, outmoded concepts of God seemed ready for retirement. No thoughtful person could buy into the fossilized delusion that the Divine Intelligence resembled a stern, prudish old man inclined to favor some groups of human beings over others. Since then, however, we have regressed. Literalist interpretations of the Bible and Koran have temporarily restored the supremacy of the Antiquated Cartoon Deity. More than ever, it's crucial that we overthrow that fake, Aries. Luckily, you're in a favorable phase to do your part in the noble work. I exhort you to dissolve obsolete images of God that stifle your relationship with the Real Thing.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In her book Writing Down the Bones, Natalie Goldberg tells aspiring wordsmiths to "Write from your obsessions. They're going to run your life anyway, so why not harness them?" That's good advice if you're an artist in any medium. The consuming fetishes and raging fantasies that threaten to drive you crazy can be converted into excellent raw material for your creative urges. But what if you're not a novelist or painter or musician or actor? How can you turn your obsessions into assets? Be alert for answers to this question. Cosmic forces are conspiring to bring you crisp new insights.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

As your mating season gets into full swing, I suggest you browse through a book called Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation, by evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson. Your mind may be blown wide open as you learn how experimental some animals are in their approach to sex. You'll read, for example, about dolphins that try to copulate with turtles and seals, orangutans that masturbate with sex toys made of leaves and twigs, female chimpanzees that average ten trysts a day with numerous lovers, homosexual romps among manatees, and female seahorses that impregnate their male partners. I'm hoping that by expanding your definition of what's "natural," you'll lose any shame you might still have about your own harmless though exotic erotic tastes.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

This horoscope has been scientifically formulated to raise your spontaneity levels and condition you to thrive on the unexpected. Do not attempt to use logic to understand it. Like a Zen koan, it is meant to give your non-rational mind a workout, thereby preparing you for what cannot be prepared for. Here goes. Find meaning in runaway shopping carts and flaming marshmallows. Seek silk and cashmere interventions in the midst of a secret test. Drum up feral breakfast conundrums with wicked, lickable angels. Welcome violins and snakes at the heart of the cool mistake. Scribble treasure maps on naked promises. Search for messages from the future in the warm glow of yesterday's shock.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

You're the best antidote for all the unoriginal thinking that's going on around you. There may be other people who have the power to overthrow the numbing status quo, but only you have the charm to do it in a graceful way that doesn't offend everyone and damage future collaborative efforts. So be a cheerful rebel, Leo. Unleash your iconoclastic fervor with the intention of making life more fun and interesting, not more annoyingly complicated.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"Time porn" is defined by www.wordspy.com as "TV shows and other media that portray characters having excessive amounts of spare time, a thing we covet but cannot have." "Seinfeld" and "Friends" are especially obscene examples of this phenomenon. I'm hoping, Virgo, that in the coming weeks you will renounce any attraction you might have to this perverse form of vicarious enjoyment. Instead, fight and claw to procure for yourself the real thing: an abundance of free, unscheduled hours when you can sit around doing nothing in particular.

No one knows you better than you do, Virgo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

The National Center for Atmospheric Research reports that the average cloud is the same weight as a hundred elephants. I suggest you use this fact as a metaphorical touchstone in the coming week. Are there any situations in your life that seem insubstantial but that are in fact quite massive? Can you think of any influence you regard as ethereal or feathery that might ultimately have the impact of a ton of bricks? This is the week you should check to see if outer appearances match up with what's inside.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

So you decided to leave your comfort zone. You dared to scare yourself for a good cause. Having researched all the options, you found the skydiving school with the best safety record. Later, fully trained, you felt reasonably confident as you went up in the plane and hurled yourself out the door into the emptiness. Hallelujah! Your parachute opened successfully. Your descent was smooth. Alas, at the last minute a strong wind blew you away from your target and your chute got snagged on a tree. Now you're safe and sound, but stranded high above the ground. What's next?

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Scorpio. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

The good news, say scientists at Sweden's University of Uppsala, is that global warming will never melt the ice caps or create endless summers in Toronto. That's because -- here comes the bad news -- oil and gas supplies will run out far sooner than expected. There's not enough of the stuff left on the planet for humans to create a dangerous excess of carbon dioxide. The scientists believe oil reserves are 80 percent smaller than generally predicted, and will peak in 2010. Let this possible scenario serve as a stimulus for meditations about your long-term future, Sagittarius. What sources of energy, money, and love that you now depend on may be gone in 15 years? What can you do to begin cultivating replacements? Visualize the life you'd like to be living in 2018, and start planting seeds you'll harvest then.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"The abyss has its own rewards." Ancient Greek myth attributed this motto to Hecate, goddess of the crossroads and queen of the night. Can you imagine what those rewards might be, Capricorn? To prepare you for your adventure in the coming weeks, I suggest you brainstorm about them now. While you won't be descending all the way to the yawning pit at the bottom of the abyss, you will spend time in the middle and upper levels. Believe it or not, this will be a good thing. It'll bring fantastic opportunities to shed delusions, expose and heal repressed emotions, and free yourself from bondage.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In times past no one was allowed to study the Qabalah until age 40, after having raised a family and gathered a wealth of life experience. The mystical doctrines were thought to be at best useless and at worst dangerous to younger seekers. The rule has now been waived, however. At this critical juncture in humanity's evolution, we need all the wise folk we can get, even at the risk of unhinging those who aren't ripe enough to apply the esoteric truths with integrity. I mention this, Aquarius, because the understandings you'll be exposed to in coming weeks would qualify you to study Qabalah no matter what your age. You'll be offered chances to dramatically expedite your maturation. If you've been emotionally stunted or deprived of learning adventures in any way, now's the time to fix that.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Aquarius. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

What seems like bad luck is not always caused by the whims of fate. Sometimes it's the result of dumb decisions and their consequences. Take the "Curse of the Bambino." It has supposedly prevented baseball's Boston Red Sox from winning the World Series since they got rid of future Hall of Famer Babe Ruth in 1920. But the real reason for Boston's enduring mediocrity is less occult: the racism of its owners. After Jackie Robinson finally integrated the game in 1947, they lagged far behind in signing black players. Not until the 1990s did the Red Sox fully catch up with other teams. Let this be a goad to your meditations, Pisces. Think about parts of your life that have seemingly suffered from bad luck. Identify the past events that are the true cause, and devise a forceful plan to dissolve the karma.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

To prepare you for your upcoming encounters with inexpressible mystery, I offer you the words of Alexander Solzhenitsyn from his Nobel Prize acceptance speech. "Not everything has a name," he said. "Some things lead us into a realm beyond words . . . to revelations unattainable by reason. It is like that small mirror in fairy tales -- you glance in it and what you see is not yourself; for an instant you glimpse the Inaccessible, where no magic carpet can take you. And the soul cries out for it."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Do one thing that scares you every day," counsels novelist Kurt Vonnegut. That's easy for a risk-loving Scorpio like him to say, but is it good advice for you Tauruses, who typically thrive on peace and safety? At most other times, I would say no; I'd suggest you force yourself to face your fears no more than once a month. But the coming weeks are shaping up as a departure from your usual rhythms. You can do a lot to ensure your long-term peace and safety through regular encounters with unpredictable experiences that will scare up your hidden reserves of courage.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

At one point in Steve Martin's novella, The Pleasure of My Company, the main character Daniel says: "The real me and a false one were competing against each other." San Francisco Chronicle reviewer David Kipen comments that "You could easily read the whole novella as the story of this competition between real and false Daniels." I think we can apply a similar description to your adventures in the coming weeks, Gemini: The deep, genuine version of you will be struggling for supremacy with the artificial, fragmented one.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"Dear Mr. Brezsny: I'm a feminist in a post-feminist era, a warrior poet when poetry is considered irrelevant in war, and a lone wolf amidst yapping coyotes. I've been a firefighter, journalist, and janitor -- and damn good at all three, not that anybody noticed. My questions are: Why is my success with men like that of a goat trying to herd trucks? Why is the only luck I ever have the 'avoided the falling piano at the last second' kind? Are there any cake raffle winnings in my future? -Anti-Heroic Crab"
	
Dear Anti-Heroic: The mournful conditions you described will take a turn for the better when you devote a concentrated time to becoming emotionally self-sufficient. During that period, vow to draw all the love you need from either yourself or whatever passes for God or Goddess in your world. Now would be the perfect moment to begin.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Clarissa Pinkola Estes is a psychotherapist and cantadora, "a keeper of the old stories." She believes that feeding the soul with nourishing tales is a great healing art. And what constitutes a "nourishing" tale? Her repertoire is filled with myths and fairy tales that "cut fine wide doors in previous blank walls, openings that lead to the dreamland, that lead to love and learning, that lead us back to our own real lives." I advise you to get some of this good stuff, Leo. Feast on unpredictable stories that replenish your innocence and rekindle your sense of wonder. Estes' book, Women Who Run With the Wolves, has some good ones. Try "Skeleton Woman" or "Sealskin, Soulskin."

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"Charlie's Angels" star Cameron Diaz, born under the sign of Virgo, hates to give autographs to fans. She's so notorious that Autograph Collector magazine named her the least approachable celebrity entertainer. Another Virgo luminary, Shannon Elizabeth, was ranked right behind Diaz in her stinginess. To redeem your tribe's reputation, I urge you to give away your autograph to anyone and everyone in the coming week. Such a generous display would also dovetail nicely with the astrological omens, which suggest you should engage in playful acts that make you feel like a star.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Many plants used for prescription drugs originate in tropical rainforests. Do their endangered ecosystems therefore harbor other healing herbs that are as yet undiscovered? Probably. But a recent study suggests that weeds growing in easily accessible places near human settlements may be an equally important source of medicine. The Journal of Ethnopharmacology reports that the Highland Mayans of Chiapa "rely almost exclusively on disturbed areas for medicinal plants, even in communities that are adjacent to stands of primary forest." I offer up this intriguing scenario as an apt metaphor for you in the coming days. The best goodies are more likely to be close at hand in the midst of familiar clutter, not in far-off enclaves of peace and plenty. (Thanks to www.eurekalert.org for this info.)

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

To supply the newsprint for the average Sunday edition of the New York Times, about 63,000 trees must die. Is that a worthy sacrifice? Maybe. To keep your body fueled with caffeine for a year, upwards of a thousand plants must give up their lives. Is that a worthy sacrifice? Possibly. To make sure your freshly hatched dream will ultimately reach full bloom, at least three of your tired old illusions will have to croak. Is that a worthy sacrifice? Hell, yes. Let the mercy killing begin.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You're not awakening from a coma or anesthesia; it's not quite that dramatic. But the effect will be similar. Events you've been blind to will suddenly become visible. You'll become a magnet for clues you've been repelling. Your emotional numbness will recede, allowing a flood of feelings to come rushing into your awareness. The net effect, at least initially, may be confusing: You'll be filled up with too much information too fast to make sense of it. But be patient and concentrate on digesting the glut, Sagittarius, and by this time next week the mess will have evolved into a web of fresh insights.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"I go through the canned-goods department of my soul," mused columnist Jon Carroll, "and I write down how many cubes of spiritual bouillon I have left." I suggest you take a similar tack this week, Capricorn. In other words, add a touch of self-mocking frivolity as you make a profound inventory of your current relationship with the Great Mystery. And be sure to mix in a few wacky, winsome questions with your heartfelt yearning for deeper understanding. Here's how Carroll expressed it: "Who am I? Why am I here? Is there an entity greater than myself? If there is, how can I get it to like me?"

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"Satan is broke!" declared a recent article in the Weekly World News. "He's selling back souls at half price to avoid bankruptcy." On the face of it, this is an amusing riff dreamed up by one of the comic geniuses who writes for the notorious tabloid. But oddly enough, there is a metaphorical grain of truth in it. The astrological omens suggest that a huge window of opportunity has opened for those who need redemption. It is a favorable moment for lost souls to find themselves, for black sheep and prodigal sons to return to the fold, and for incorrigible troublemakers to mend their ways. I'm letting you know, Aquarius, because your tribe, more than any of the other signs, is in the best position to facilitate rehabilitations and restorations of all kinds -- both for others and for yourself.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"I've finally got my relationship problem figured out," wrote Melinda, a reader from Philadelphia. "It has been a lifelong, insidious misunderstanding of what I'm entitled to, combined with a fear of abandonment that has made me grab onto the wrong companions." I bring this testimony to your attention, Pisces, because I think it resonates with realizations you're ready for. The coming months will be a favorable time for you to discern the hidden karma that has been keeping you from getting the love you want. A good way to begin your search will be to take inventory of your fear of abandonment and your misunderstanding of what you're entitled to.

To prepare you for your upcoming encounters with inexpressible mystery, I offer you the words of Alexander Solzhenitsyn from his Nobel Prize acceptance speech. "Not everything has a name," he said. "Some things lead us into a realm beyond words . . . to revelations unattainable by reason. It is like that small mirror in fairy tales -- you glance in it and what you see is not yourself; for an instant you glimpse the Inaccessible, where no magic carpet can take you. And the soul cries out for it."

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Aries? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Do one thing that scares you every day," counsels novelist Kurt Vonnegut. That's easy for a risk-loving Scorpio like him to say, but is it good advice for you Tauruses, who typically thrive on peace and safety? At most other times, I would say no; I'd suggest you force yourself to face your fears no more than once a month. But the coming weeks are shaping up as a departure from your usual rhythms. You can do a lot to ensure your long-term peace and safety through regular encounters with unpredictable experiences that will scare up your hidden reserves of courage.

Want to explore the coming week even further, Taurus? Dig deeper? Feel stronger? Consider tuning in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

At one point in Steve Martin's novella, The Pleasure of My Company, the main character Daniel says: "The real me and a false one were competing against each other." San Francisco Chronicle reviewer David Kipen comments that "You could easily read the whole novella as the story of this competition between real and false Daniels." I think we can apply a similar description to your adventures in the coming weeks, Gemini: The deep, genuine version of you will be struggling for supremacy with the artificial, fragmented one.

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Gemini? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"Dear Mr. Brezsny: I'm a feminist in a post-feminist era, a warrior poet when poetry is considered irrelevant in war, and a lone wolf amidst yapping coyotes. I've been a firefighter, journalist, and janitor -- and damn good at all three, not that anybody noticed. My questions are: Why is my success with men like that of a goat trying to herd trucks? Why is the only luck I ever have the 'avoided the falling piano at the last second' kind? Are there any cake raffle winnings in my future? -Anti-Heroic Crab"
	
Dear Anti-Heroic: The mournful conditions you described will take a turn for the better when you devote a concentrated time to becoming emotionally self-sufficient. During that period, vow to draw all the love you need from either yourself or whatever passes for God or Goddess in your world. Now would be the perfect moment to begin.

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Cancerian? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Clarissa Pinkola Estes is a psychotherapist and cantadora, "a keeper of the old stories." She believes that feeding the soul with nourishing tales is a great healing art. And what constitutes a "nourishing" tale? Her repertoire is filled with myths and fairy tales that "cut fine wide doors in previous blank walls, openings that lead to the dreamland, that lead to love and learning, that lead us back to our own real lives." I advise you to get some of this good stuff, Leo. Feast on unpredictable stories that replenish your innocence and rekindle your sense of wonder. Estes' book, Women Who Run With the Wolves, has some good ones. Try "Skeleton Woman" or "Sealskin, Soulskin."

No one knows you better than you do, Leo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"Charlie's Angels" star Cameron Diaz, born under the sign of Virgo, hates to give autographs to fans. She's so notorious that Autograph Collector magazine named her the least approachable celebrity entertainer. Another Virgo luminary, Shannon Elizabeth, was ranked right behind Diaz in her stinginess. To redeem your tribe's reputation, I urge you to give away your autograph to anyone and everyone in the coming week. Such a generous display would also dovetail nicely with the astrological omens, which suggest you should engage in playful acts that make you feel like a star.

Hungry for more inspiration, Virgo? Curious about the unfolding mysteries? For more juicy details about your destiny in the coming week, check out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Many plants used for prescription drugs originate in tropical rainforests. Do their endangered ecosystems therefore harbor other healing herbs that are as yet undiscovered? Probably. But a recent study suggests that weeds growing in easily accessible places near human settlements may be an equally important source of medicine. The Journal of Ethnopharmacology reports that the Highland Mayans of Chiapa "rely almost exclusively on disturbed areas for medicinal plants, even in communities that are adjacent to stands of primary forest." I offer up this intriguing scenario as an apt metaphor for you in the coming days. The best goodies are more likely to be close at hand in the midst of familiar clutter, not in far-off enclaves of peace and plenty. (Thanks to www.eurekalert.org for this info.)

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Libra. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

To supply the newsprint for the average Sunday edition of the New York Times, about 63,000 trees must die. Is that a worthy sacrifice? Maybe. To keep your body fueled with caffeine for a year, upwards of a thousand plants must give up their lives. Is that a worthy sacrifice? Possibly. To make sure your freshly hatched dream will ultimately reach full bloom, at least three of your tired old illusions will have to croak. Is that a worthy sacrifice? Hell, yes. Let the mercy killing begin.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You're not awakening from a coma or anesthesia; it's not quite that dramatic. But the effect will be similar. Events you've been blind to will suddenly become visible. You'll become a magnet for clues you've been repelling. Your emotional numbness will recede, allowing a flood of feelings to come rushing into your awareness. The net effect, at least initially, may be confusing: You'll be filled up with too much information too fast to make sense of it. But be patient and concentrate on digesting the glut, Sagittarius, and by this time next week the mess will have evolved into a web of fresh insights.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Sagittarius? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"I go through the canned-goods department of my soul," mused columnist Jon Carroll, "and I write down how many cubes of spiritual bouillon I have left." I suggest you take a similar tack this week, Capricorn. In other words, add a touch of self-mocking frivolity as you make a profound inventory of your current relationship with the Great Mystery. And be sure to mix in a few wacky, winsome questions with your heartfelt yearning for deeper understanding. Here's how Carroll expressed it: "Who am I? Why am I here? Is there an entity greater than myself? If there is, how can I get it to like me?"

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Capricorn. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"Satan is broke!" declared a recent article in the Weekly World News. "He's selling back souls at half price to avoid bankruptcy." On the face of it, this is an amusing riff dreamed up by one of the comic geniuses who writes for the notorious tabloid. But oddly enough, there is a metaphorical grain of truth in it. The astrological omens suggest that a huge window of opportunity has opened for those who need redemption. It is a favorable moment for lost souls to find themselves, for black sheep and prodigal sons to return to the fold, and for incorrigible troublemakers to mend their ways. I'm letting you know, Aquarius, because your tribe, more than any of the other signs, is in the best position to facilitate rehabilitations and restorations of all kinds -- both for others and for yourself.

Want more clues, Aquarius? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"I've finally got my relationship problem figured out," wrote Melinda, a reader from Philadelphia. "It has been a lifelong, insidious misunderstanding of what I'm entitled to, combined with a fear of abandonment that has made me grab onto the wrong companions." I bring this testimony to your attention, Pisces, because I think it resonates with realizations you're ready for. The coming months will be a favorable time for you to discern the hidden karma that has been keeping you from getting the love you want. A good way to begin your search will be to take inventory of your fear of abandonment and your misunderstanding of what you're entitled to.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The latest movie from Aries filmmaker Quentin Tarantino received mixed reviews. Commenting on "Kill Bill," Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper raved, "It's amazing. Brilliant and stylized! Tarantino is at the top of his form." On the other hand, critic Mick LaSalle had this to say: "If this recycled, derivative nonsense is all this once-promising director has to offer after six years, it's sad." I predict you will provoke a similar range of reactions in the coming week, Aries. It's probably best if you don't put too much stock in either the people who regard you as a genius or those who think you're a crank. Just be satisfied to believe in yourself.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Consumer brands are the new religion," reports "The Financial Times." "People turn to them for meaning." The evidence? Instead of attending church on Sunday, many of the faithful swarm to Ikea. Countless couples exchange their marital vows at Disneyland. Bikers are buried in coffins bearing Harley-Davidson logos. Don't tell me you haven't been infected with this faux religion, Taurus; we all have. But I'm happy to announce that it's a perfect astrological moment for blasphemy and dissent. Renounce your worshipful attachment to brand names and products that are sapping your spiritual juice! Break the hold of your addiction NOW! Just say NO to false gods!

No one knows you better than you do, Taurus. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

 I have just finished skimming Hiroyuki Nishigaki's surprising book How to Good-Bye Depression: If You Constrict Anus 100 Times Everyday. Malarkey? or Effective Way? Though I haven't had a chance to try out his simple and revolutionary approach to mental health, I feel confident about recommending it to you. It's time to take drastic, perhaps unconventional measures to disperse the funky moods that have plagued you recently. Regular butt-squeezing may be able to accomplish what no other therapy can. As one satisfied reader testified after achieving miracles with this technique: "Free your ass and your mind will follow."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Can you find a sensitive saint who'll cater to your desires for a whole day? Someone who is knowledgeable about what gives you pleasure, who would listen with supple curiosity to your stories, who would sing you songs and read you poems and describe to you in lyrical detail all your wonderful qualities? In other words, Cancerian, can you enlist the devotion of a love genius who would regard being of service to you as a holy privilege? The planets have rarely been better aligned for such a possibility. The entire universe is yearning to be more demonstrative in showing its love for you.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Cancerian. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

The bumblebee seems to be aerodynamically unsound. Its body weight appears too great for its wingspan. Indeed, if it were as big as an airplane, it would never get off the ground. Fortunately, it knows nothing of the laws of physics as they apply to machines, and therefore never suffers from self-doubt as it soars and darts. I suggest you make this creature your power animal in the coming weeks. You will need to accomplish small wonders that there are no theories to account for.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

My reading of your astrological omens suggests that you are now standing before three doors. The word "scapegoat" is written on door number one. "Chameleon" is on door two and "weaver" on door three. What you do in the next six days will determine whether you'll ultimately have a choice about which door you open. If you do succeed in winning that privilege, I advise you to pick the "weaver" door sometime after November 22. Selecting the "chameleon" door wouldn't be terrible, but it wouldn't be half as stimulating.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Recently I received a letter with testimony you might find helpful. "Hello, my name is Randall Xavier Ludwick," it began. "I am inspector number 23 for the Federal Commission on Amusement Park Safety. My main responsibility is to ensure that all 'You Must Be This Tall To Go on This Ride' signs are up to code. It's the perfect job for a major Libra like me. Since I can never make up my mind if left to my own devices, I decided to pursue a career that has rigid boundaries and also appeals to my sense of justice." Mr. Ludwick's approach to his indecisiveness might be worth imitating in the coming weeks, dear Libra. I suggest you put yourself in positions where you must adhere to crisply defined limits and rules. (Thanks to Edgar Roberts for introducing me to Mr. Ludwick.)

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

You are fresh, radical, and as free as you've ever been. Only the ripest truths interest you. No pretty lies can trick you and no super-hyped trivia can distract you. I believe you're ready, therefore, to commune with the axioms of healing chaos, lifted from the Whores of Goddess Scientists website. Here's a sample. You are the hidden God. Wake up in the dream. Read between the lies. To question is the answer. The frontline is everywhere. There are no innocent bystanders. Truth is a three-edged sword. Practice infinite tolerance except for intolerance. Achieve strength through joy. Embrace your shadow. Change is stability. Creation never ends. Everything is verb. The way in is the way out. All things fornicate all the time. The going is the goal. Today is the day!

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Walk into the hills or woods and find a large rock jutting up out of the earth in a place that makes you feel at home. Sit down on or next to that rock and let go of the tightly wound emotions you've been holding onto. Sob or sigh or babble until you achieve a spiritual orgasm that will clear your mind of all its gunk and free you to make the decision you've been postponing. Ever hereafter you will call this the Crying Rock, and you will go there whenever you need the kind of release that only a beloved natural power spot can facilitate.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

If a friend or companion is pregnant, buy her some lingerie. If people close to you are depressed, take them to a karaoke bar and insist that they sing in public. If you're feeling cautious and superstitious, book a flight to an island paradise or learn to ride a motorcycle. If you're afraid you're running out of good ideas, start writing a booklet entitled, "My Inexhaustible Supply of Good Ideas." Are you catching my drift, Capricorn? To capitalize on the odd opportunities fate will bring you this week, you should definitely not go with the flow.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Many of you feel that you're only truly yourself if others see you as you want to be seen. But this week I suggest you try out a different perspective. It's hinted at by Suzan-Lori Parks in her play "Topdog/ Underdog": "Yr only yrself when no one's watching." Who are you when you're alone, Aquarius? Turn off your awareness of what everyone thinks about you. Listen only to the clues arising from your silent depths.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Back in the days when I could afford employees, one of them dreamed up a witty ad campaign for my expanded audio horoscopes. The headline was "Rob Brezsny's astrological advice is like Viagra for the soul!" A week after the first ads appeared, I got a letter from the lawyers of the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the real Viagra. "Cease and desist using our trademarked brand name," it said, "or we will sue your ass." (I'm paraphrasing.) My campaign came to a dead stop, and I vowed never again to borrow a corporate fetish for my own marketing purposes. Carefully, then, I make the following announcement: What life brings you in the coming weeks will be like Viagra for your soul.

Aries (March 21-April 19)
Couvade occurs in a variety of indigenous cultures. It's a phenomenon in which a man experiences morning sickness, unusual appetites, and other symptoms similar to his pregnant mate. There's no known physiological basis for it. He may even have labor pains as the child is born, diminishing the mother's distress as if he has mysteriously been able to take some of it on. I suggest we make couvade your word of power for now, Aries. It's likely that someone close to you will soon be giving birth, at least metaphorically. The more you help bear a share of the wonderful ordeal, the bigger your reward will be later.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Aries. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Change your relationship with mirrors, Taurus. If you tend to be obsessed with what they tell you, lose your addiction and escape their tyranny. If you usually avoid them out of fear, summon your courage and approach them with your warrior's heart fully engaged. And in the event you're typically rather apathetic towards them, develop a more intimate connection. It's time to shift the dynamic between you and your reflection.

Want more clues, Taurus? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Gemini Kathleen Raine won several literary awards for her mystical nature poetry and was a highly respected scholar who specialized in William Butler Yeats and William Blake. She died last August at age 95. An obituary in "The Daily Telegraph" noted that she was surprised to have survived so long. More than 35 years ago, a prophetic figure in one of her dreams proclaimed that she had only 100 months (less than nine years) left to live. It just goes to show you that even the smartest, most refined students of the great mysteries are susceptible to being deceived about important matters by the little voices in their heads. Be aware of that as you listen to the jabber that fills your inner landscape in the coming week.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The Cancerian mascot is the crab, which is typically a small, shy creature that moves sideways and backwards a lot. The giant land crab of Cuba is a species apart, however. It runs so fast it can outrace a horse. I nominate this super-crab to serve as your power animal during the coming weeks, when cosmic forces will be conspiring to make you exceptionally robust, forceful, and direct. Charge!

Leo (July 23-August 22)

To gather research for his book, The Age of Missing Information, Bill McKibben watched 1700 hours of videotaped TV shows. In the midst of the babble he detected a single subliminal message flowing relentlessly: "You are the most important thing on Earth." He was disturbed by his discovery, seeing it as a big reason our culture is infected with toxic levels of narcissism. Normally I share his aversion, but this week I'm making an exception.  For a limited time only, Leo, you truly are the most important thing on Earth. Soak up the glory, the attention, and the adoration -- and be prepared to exercise far more responsibility than usual, too.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"Dear Rob: Help! I'm stuck! I give till it hurts, then lash out at those I've lavished my generosity on. I hope too much, setting expectations too high almost on purpose so I have an excuse if things don't pan out. I worry about everything that MIGHT go wrong, sometimes precipitating exactly what I worry about. Please advise! -Virgo in a Rut"
	Dear Virgo: The lucid honesty you just demonstrated is a first step in quitting your addiction to the unwanted behaviors you described. Now is a perfect time, astrologically speaking, to go further. The next step is to feel compassion and forgiveness for the part of you that acts so automatically.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Your body contains enough iron to make a spike strong enough to hold your weight." So proclaims the www.madscience.com website. I would like you to visualize yourself holding such a spike right now, Libra. Think of it as your secret talisman for the coming weeks -- an inspirational symbol that will motivate you to transform your flabby sense of purpose into an iron will. You now have the power to intensify your discipline and drive beyond what you ever imagined was possible.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Warning and congratulations! Wake-up calls are on tap. Here are examples of the kinds of benevolent shocks you may be treated to. 1. You reverently approach a cherished idol. As you bow down, you spy a dirty sock on the floor. 2. You dream of hiking through green hills in springtime. As you loop around a huge boulder, you come upon a mare giving birth to a colt. 3. You receive a Hallmark card in an envelope with no return address. The corny cartoon on the front turns you off. But when you open it up you find a slip of paper on which is handwritten a brilliant poem that fills you with catalytic emotions.

No one knows you better than you do, Scorpio. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Many mythic traditions describe an underworld where souls reside after death and where those who are still alive can visit to gain desperately needed insights. The latter category fits you right now, Sagittarius. You're wandering in the shadowy nether regions, searching for clues that will be of use to you when you come back to deal with your problems here in the sunlit realm. I'm guessing that this exploration, as confounding as it may be, is actually pretty fun in an eerie sort of way. The really hard part will come once it's time for your return. You may be tempted to hang around down there too long. Don't. The treasure you find will be wasted unless you bring it back promptly.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Thinking is more interesting than knowing, but less interesting than looking." That's what the German writer Goethe said back in the nineteenth century, and it's especially true for you now. Here's a corollary that's true only for you in the next two weeks: "Thinking is more useful than knowing, but less useful than looking." In other words, Capricorn, gathering facts and being an expert should be your lowest priority in the coming days. Questioning and analyzing should be moderately important. But the activity you should emphasize most is seeing into the heart of the world around you with compassionate, penetrating objectivity.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Capricorn. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

You have the keys to doors that don't exist yet; save those keys. You know the titles for stories that haven't happened yet; write those titles down. You've caught glimpses of your future, but they're confusing because you can't imagine how you'll get to that future; imprint those glimpses on your memory. In conclusion, Aquarius, shout "hallelujah" and pour yourself a glass of champagne. You have all you need to cultivate a potent kind of faith that's based on hard data, not hopes and wishes.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In addition to meditations on the cosmic omens, my preparations for writing this horoscope were extensive. I read John Milton's book, Paradise Lost, and the sequel, Paradise Regained. I ate both gourmet organic meals and greasy junk food. I rode the roller coaster with my scholarly friend, Arthur, with whom I discussed the Kabbalah, and watched horror films in the basement apartment of my smart but degenerate friend Rocky, who's writing a novel about his past life as a queer pirate in a seventeenth-century anarchist community in Barbados. In other words, Pisces, to work myself into the right frame of mind to channel your oracle, I had to soar to the transcendent heights and plunge into the grungy depths -- sort of like what you'll be doing this week.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You have two biological parents, four grandparents, and eight great-grandparents. You wouldn't be you if it weren't for those 14 people. The legacy they bequeathed you played a major role in determining your talents and flaws, your predilections and aversions. And this is a perfect astrological moment to get to know them better. In fact, deepening your connection to your family's history will provide crucial clues as you seek to reinvigorate your tired old perspectives on long-running dilemmas. Are you brave enough to mutate your understanding of where you came from and where, therefore, you belong? Halloween costume suggestion: the ancestor who fascinates you the most.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

If I were writing this horoscope for "Gun Lovers' Casino Porn Today" magazine, I might advise my Taurus readers to keep their vices firmly in check, as this is a time when anti-social vices are likely to cause even more havoc than usual. However, since you are reading my words in a respectable publication and are undoubtedly a refined and ethical person, I feel comfortable advising you to tap into the instinctual part of your nature that is usually off-limits. Halloween costume suggestion: the animal whose spirit would best awaken your dormant wildness.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"You may have been born to be a worrywart," says Edward Hallowell in his book Worry: Controlling It and Using It Wisely. "Some people have a nervous system that is like an alarm system that goes off too easily." In my experience, only about eight percent of the Gemini tribe fit this description in normal times. But between late October and mid-November every year, the number zooms. Many of you suddenly act as if you're hard-wired to generate anxiety. You seem to enjoy scaring yourself silly. Why? What's going on? It's true that this is a favorable time to confront your doubts and fears. But the point is to conquer them, not let them consume and demoralize you. My advice, then, is to unleash your inner warrior immediately. Halloween costume suggestions: your favorite superhero or crusader for justice.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

New species of delight are headed your way, lucky one. Outbursts of exotic bliss await you. There's only one obstacle that could interfere with your enjoyment: your attachment to old familiar ways of stirring up the good times. Be willing to put them aside, at least temporarily, so that you can be fully available for sources of future happiness. Keep William Blake's poem in mind: "He who bends to himself a joy / Does the winged life destroy; / But he who kisses the joy as it flies / Lives in eternity's sunrise." Halloween costume suggestion: your favorite bird.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In my meditations on your immediate future, I have sometimes seen poignant images: a wet firecracker, for instance, and a flickering flame on a thin candle propped up in a paper boat floating down a creek. But there have been other times when the image that came to mind as I meditated on you was a lover crying cathartic tears while in the midst of a powerful orgasm. Which of these two perspectives is likely to predominate for you this week? It may depend on your ability to create a potent blend of the magic of fire and the magic of water. Halloween costume suggestions: a mermaid carrying a torch or Neptune, god of the sea, holding a thunderbolt.

The current state of your fate could drive you half-crazy if you're not patient. The gods seem to be teasing you with tantalizing promises that they later rescind. You've practically been forced to master the art of living on the edge and in between. I'm reminded of a passage from a poem by Octavio Paz: "All is visible and elusive,/ all is near and can't be touched." My advice, Virgo: Visualize your predicament as an intriguing enigma, not a maddening ambiguity. See if you can approximate the condition the poet William Wordsworth described: "fleeting moods of shadowy exultation." Halloween costume suggestions: a puzzle, a majestic cloud, a second mask worn over the first mask.

No one knows you better than you do, Virgo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Dear Rob: I've spent my life trying to adjust to the fact that I never finished being born. Literally. It's as if I didn't actually agree to leave the womb; never surrendered to being cast out of heaven and exiled into this heavy, difficult place called Earth. As a result, I feel I'm not completely here; I'm always holding back a little. But I'm tired of this tentativeness. I want to arrive fully and embrace my destiny. Can you help? -Unborn Libra."
	Dear Unborn: Interesting you should bring this up. It's a favorable time for you Libras to come all the way down to earth. I suggest that you do a meditation in which you visualize yourself being born while filled with a sense of glee, triumph, and freedom. Halloween costume suggestion: a very happy baby.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

If you enjoy tormenting yourself with fantasies of bad things that might happen in the future, surf over to the "Dante's Inferno Test" website. There you can get a prediction about what level of hell you'll be exiled to after you die. If, on the other hand, you're finally ready to shed your perverse attraction to doom and gloom -- and my astrological analysis says you are -- then zealously avoid entertaining yourself with fear and anxiety. Instead, use all your ingenuity to track down fascinating encounters with boom and zoom. Halloween costume suggestions: a pirate wearing smiley face buttons or a gangsta rapper with a fuzzy Sesame Street puppet.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Scorpio. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You're a giant surrounded by ants. Unfortunately, the ants are better organized than you. What are you going do about it? It's not too late to launch a crash program to match them in their disciplined strength. If you do it now, you can accomplish this seemingly improbable feat without diluting the creative power of your messy fertility. Here's one suggestion that might help: Design a Halloween costume that expresses both extremes. You could be a soldier wearing a jester's hat, for instance, or an ant riding a unicycle.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Confront the difficult while it is still easy," suggests the ancient Chinese book Tao Te Ching. "Accomplish the great task by a series of small acts." This is perfect advice for you to act on in the coming weeks, Capricorn. To it I will add three variations on the theme: 1. Fix things before they're broken. 2. Arrange to have a showdown on your home turf as soon as possible so you don't have to submit to a confrontation in a time and place your adversary chooses. 3. Go looking for good trouble before it degenerates into bad trouble. Halloween costume suggestions: scout, tracker, pathfinder, fortuneteller.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Capricorn? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Here are your affirmations for the week, Aquarius. Say them aloud at least 20 times every day. "I want to have a vision of the recognition I will some day be worthy of. I want to ignore everyone else's definition of 'professionalism' and create my own. I want my reputation to be a close reflection of who I really am. I want to feel what it's like to have supple faith in my decisions." Halloween costume suggestions: the leader you most admire, a famous wise person, an unpretentious king or queen.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Aquarius. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

It seems that the long-sought treasure is different from what it was when you first launched your quest to make it yours. Either that, or it has stayed the same and you have changed. Whatever the case may be, the fact is that you need to adjust your relationship with it. Its meaning and value have shifted, and the strategy you've employed in your pursuit of it won't work much longer. Halloween costume suggestions: a knight of the Round Table, an alchemist in search of the philosopher's stone, a religious seeker headed for the promised land.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I confess to have fallen prey to a sin that has become widespread: overusing the term "sacred." To my credit, I haven't sunk to the vulgar depths of New Age hucksters who offer workshops in "sacred e-mail marketing" or "sacred dog-walking." But still, I want to be more spare in invoking the term so that on those rare occasions when I do, you will be appropriately awed. Like now, for instance. I predict you will soon be roused to reverence by a visitation that fits the description given by Phil Cousineau in his book, The Art of Pilgrimage: "If you aren't trembling as you approach the sacred, it isn't the real thing. The sacred, in its various guises as holy ground, art, or knowledge, evokes emotion and commotion."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Taurus William Henry Seward was the U.S. Secretary of State in the 1860s. Though his career included many notable achievements, he is best known for buying Alaska from Russia. His contemporaries thought this was a batty idea -- Alaska was regarded as a frozen wasteland -- and referred to it as "Seward's Folly." Ultimately, his determination to follow his dream in the face of ridicule proved to be an act of brave genius. For 2.5 cents an acre, he added a rich land that now composes one-fifth of the entire United States. I predict that you, Taurus, will soon have a chance to pull off your own version of Seward's Folly.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Trial and error should be your main strategy these days. It's your best hope for generating reliable information. As you grope and stumble, keep in mind the following thoughts from philosopher Robert Anton Wilson. "These are the batting averages of the best hitters in baseball history: Ty Cobb: .366; Rogers Hornsby: .358; Joe Jackson: .356. Since an average of .333 means a player did not get a hit two out of every three times he batted, these champions made an out more often than they got a hit. Most professional players do much worse. Moral of the story: Unless you're a brain champion equal to these baseball champions, you're probably wrong close to two out of three times."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Even if you're in love and happy with your partner, this is a perfect moment to ask for even more from your relationship. And if there is room for improvement in the way your love life is unfolding, it's an even more perfect moment. To launch the intimacy revolution, try this. After taking a bath and while still naked, write down the worst things that have happened to you because of being in love. Burn this document in the flame of a white candle while chanting the words "I am letting go of past disasters." Then dab cinnamon on your forehead, chest, and genitals while murmuring this: "I deserve to be in love with a lover who brings out the best in me -- a lover who inspires me to be in love with everything alive."

Leo (July 23-August 22)

We're all pretty ignorant about how our bodies work. Do you even know where your pancreas and spleen are, let alone what they do? Can you describe what happens to the air you inhale once it enters your lungs? Have you ever taken the trouble to study and experiment in order to discern what diet is best for your unique physiology? Do you know how much sleep you need to be highly alert and psychologically healthy? This is a favorable astrological time to deepen your understanding of your body's mysteries.

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Leo? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I've been staring at my astrological charts for hours trying to determine where your head is at. The best I can figure out is that you're off the map . . . between the worlds . . . beyond the boundaries. Sorry I'm not able to be more specific. I guess you're pretty much on your own for now. I can at least tell you about the powers that this kind of outsider position usually confers: 1. sharper-than-usual intuition about the future; 2. a knack for making unexpected connections you didn't realize you needed; 3. an unpredictability that makes you attractive to people who can help draw out and clarify your unconscious desires.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Dear Rob: Your horoscopes tickle me in just the right place: wherever the opposite of my funny bone is. It's like you're following me around, but not like a creepy stalker -- more like a kindly and slightly frazzled guardian angel, giving me the odd nudge to avoid doing something stupid, suggesting when I should duck, and rousing the part of me that's ready to give up. Thank you thank you thank you. -Appreciative Libra"
	Dear Appreciative: Somehow you knew that it's a perfect time to express your gratitude to those who have helped and inspired you. Saying thanks right now will be a kind of prayer that works better than begging for what you lack. It will have the mysterious effect of attracting to you even more goodies.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

You're on the verge of tapping into a huge reservoir of fresh, starting-over energy. To aid you in capitalizing on this gift, I offer you Ellen Kort's poem, "Advice to Beginners." Begin. Keep on beginning. Nibble on everything. Pull up anchors. Sit close to the god of night. Lie still in a stream and breathe water. Climb to the top of the highest tree until you come to the branch where the blue heron sleeps. Eat poems for breakfast. Lick the mountain's bare shoulder. Measure the color of days around your mother's death. Put your hands over your face and listen to what they tell you. Swim with the sea turtle into the moon. Drink wild geranium tea. Run naked in the rain.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"Modern woman's premenstrual crankiness is not just a physical syndrome," writes Clarissa Pinkola Estes in her book Women Who Run With the Wolves, "but is equally attributable to her being thwarted in her need to take enough time to revivify and renew herself." I would add my belief that men get cranky as often as women, and for the same reason: There are no ritually sanctified time-outs built into our crazy-making schedules. None of us has the slack necessary to avoid periodic meltdowns. This is a crucial point you cannot afford to ignore, Sagittarius. You're overdue for a sabbatical from your routine.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

You're emotionally healthy right now. Your mental hygiene is as good as it's possible to be. Here's a great way to celebrate: Share the wealth; commit vivid acts of generosity. Be discriminating about where you bestow your blessings, though. Since you can't help and save everyone, concentrate your attention on high-functioning people who will in turn multiply your gifts as they help and save others.

No one knows you better than you do, Capricorn. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

A few years ago a group of smart-ass nerds hosted a jokey International Conference on Mad Science. They called for the submission of papers on topics like "tampering with the life-sustaining forces of the Universe," "exceeding the limitations of the human body via grotesque metamorphoses," and "ill-advised dabbling with supernatural intelligences." I hereby protest their slanderous satire. The eccentric yet often brilliant experiments of the Aquarian tribe suggest that some forms of mad science result in good and beautiful works. And it is a perfect astrological moment for you to prove me right. You're poised to collaborate ingeniously with the life-sustaining forces of the universe, transcend limitations through graceful metamorphoses, and enjoy useful communications with supernatural intelligences.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This may sound crazy, but the best way to attract good luck in the coming week is to experiment with doing the opposite of what you usually do. For instance, you could act as if limitations are fantastic opportunities. Instead of indulging your impulses, you can question them -- lightheartedly, of course. Rather than leading everyone into interesting temptation with your fiery enthusiasm, you could be a meditative follower who listens well and tries out other people's daring plans. Any other ideas?

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The next couple of weeks will be an excellent time to purge any nagging karma that has been haunting your love life. You'll be ready to move on to new romantic frontiers once you clear away the residue that has been subtly burdening you. To achieve the proper spirit of rowdy fierceness, I suggest you learn the following country music songs and belt them out now and then: "You Done Tore Out My Heart And Stomped That Sucker Flat," "Get Your Tongue out of My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Goodbye," "How Can I Miss You If You Won't Go Away?," "I Wouldn't Take You To A Dawg Fight, Cause I'm Afraid You'd Win," "I Liked You Better Before I Knew You So Well," and "I Flushed You From The Toilets Of My Heart."

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

This is your official too-much-of-a-good-thing warning. To protect and preserve the sweet progress you've enjoyed in recent weeks, make sure that abundance doesn't tip over into gross excess. How? Refuse to become a slave to your good ideas. Don't let your triumphs lead to exhaustion. Avoid expressions of generosity that are wasted on the recipients or motivated mostly by the urge to impress people. You can keep all your well-earned rewards, dear Gemini, if you'll start setting graceful new limits now.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Most practitioners of the healing arts believe in taking a gradual approach. Psychotherapists and acupuncturists, for example, typically see their clients once a week, theorizing that even deep-seated problems have to be undone slowly and gently. Some mavericks take a more radical approach, however. One acupuncturist I know has her clients come and stay at her clinic for six consecutive days, during which time she administers a fresh treatment every two hours. This is the kind of approach I recommend for you right now, Cancerian. You're on the verge of curing a certain longstanding imbalance, and intense, concentrated attention is the best way to do it.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I shopped at a local supermarket for months before striking up a conversation with Wendy, one of the check-out clerks. "How was your weekend?" I asked her one Monday. "I worked at my two other jobs," she said. I was surprised, having assumed her career consisted entirely of tallying grocery purchases. "I'm a psychotherapist at a group home for disturbed teens," she continued, "and I'm trying to finish my PhD dissertation." I blushed in embarrassment for having misread her so thoroughly. As she processed my order, we had an interesting exchange about adolescent angst and the politics of psychotherapy. I suggest you make Wendy your inspirational symbol this week, Leo. May she remind you to dig beneath the surface and uncover the deeper truth about everything you think you have figured out.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"The fox knows many things," said the ancient Greek poet Archilochus, "but the hedgehog knows one big thing." Twentieth-century philosopher Isaiah Berlin used this thought as an organizing principle in discussing types of writers. Hedgehogs like Dante and Plato yearned to explain life's apparent chaos with a single, all-embracing theory, Berlin believed, whereas foxes like Shakespeare preferred to revel in the world's messy multiplicity without feeling a need to unify it all in one system. My long experience with astrological types has convinced me that most Virgos tend to be foxes. In the coming days, however, I advise you to try out the hedgehog perspective. It'll ensure you don't miss the forest for the trees.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Where exactly does happiness come from, ask David Meyers and Ed Diener in their article, "The Science of Happiness," published in "The Futurist" magazine. Do you experience happiness primarily through being a good person or contemplating the meaning of life? From indulging in pleasure or knowing the truth? From preserving comfy illusions or purging yourself of pent-up rage and sadness? All the above? Let these questions be the starting point for your own meditations on the subject, Libra. It's a perfect moment to get very serious about defining what brings you joy and making concrete plans to harvest more of it.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The science newsletter, "Mini-Annals of Improbable Research," did a poll of its readers on the question, "Does reality exist?" Forty-two percent answered yes, while 31 percent asserted that it most certainly does not. The remaining 27 percent were undecided. A few of the latter believed that their reality exists but no one else's does. Two people said, "Yes, reality exists, but you can't get to it." According to one respondent, "Reality exists only when it is really necessary." Remember that line, Scorpio, because it will be quite necessary for your reality to exist in the coming weeks. Here's another response to the poll that you should make your own: "Reality especially exists right after a thunderstorm." I predict that your reality will become vivid and deep once your metaphorical tempest ends in a few days.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Fate is conspiring to suck you into an intensive behavioral modification program. The goal: to weed out the wishy-washy wishes and leech out the lukewarm longings that are keeping you distracted from your burning desires. Here's the paradoxical formula that will be at the heart of this process: If you try to maintain the illusion that you're not losing yourself, you will in fact lose yourself. But if you surrender and agree to lose yourself, you will break through to a new level of communion with the deepest, most eternal part of yourself.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)
Nice guys finish last. So proclaimed the crusty old baseball player, Leo Durocher, who was famous last century for his rough play and dirty tricks. His once-wicked insinuation has, 50 years later, devolved into a decadent platitude. It needs an update. As you enter a phase when it will make sense to become more strategic, Capricorn, try on the following formulas for size: Nice guys finish last because they follow all the rules by rote. Nasty guys often don't even finish because they break the rules by rote. Smart guys and riot grrrls win because they get away with inventing new rules that update the meaning of the ever-evolving game.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Would you consider acquiring a three-foot-long double-edged sword like the one Beowulf wielded in his famous battle with the monster many centuries ago? A blade resembling King Arthur's Excalibur would be fine, too, as would one modeled after Glandring, which belonged to the wizard Gandalf in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. You won't need this weapon to defend yourself from physical attack in the coming days, Aquarius; that's not why I recommend it. Rather, I suggest you use it as a magical prop in a ritual designed to rouse your warrior spirit. Hold it in front of you as you visualize yourself scaring off your inner demons and cutting away the inessential concerns that are bogging you down.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

This may be the time your descendants will tell stories about: the turning point when you outwit an old nemesis and undo an ancient knot, freeing you to finally begin fulfilling your life purpose in earnest. On the other hand, this may be the moment when you shrink back from a challenge similar to one that many generations of your family members have faced. If that's what happens, your descendants will be lacking an important clue when they encounter their own version of the ancestral puzzle many years from now. Which will it be, Pisces? Answering the call to adventure or refusing it?

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"I've been practicing radical authenticity lately," my Aries friend Steve told me. "I'm revealing the blunt truth about unmentionable subjects to everyone I know. It's been pretty hellish -- no one likes having the social masks stripped away -- but it's been ultimately rewarding." I thought a minute, then said, "I admire your boldness in naming the currents flowing beneath the surface, but I'm curious as to why you imply they're all negative. To practice radical authenticity, shouldn't you also express the raw truth about what's right, good, and beautiful? Shouldn't you unleash the praise and gratitude that normally go unspoken?" Steve sneered. He thought my version of radical authenticity was wimpy. I hope you don't, Aries. You have an astrological mandate to be honest in both ways.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

One of my favorite obscure holidays is International Moment of Frustration Scream Day. Observed every October 12, it's meant to release pent-up tension resulting from the gap between what we have and what we think we want. Given the fact that your gap is particularly gaping right now, you Tauruses would especially benefit from throwing yourself into this fierce enjoyment with all your angst unfurled. The holiday's founders, Thomas and Ruth Roy, suggest that everyone should go outside sometime during the day and yell for 30 seconds. I hope the sound of you bellowing Bulls will be heard around the world.

It looks like you're poised to put the finishing touches on something that will last a very long time -- an expression or creation that will be a defining monument to your essential self. If I'm right and you're really ready, let me offer a suggestion. This masterpiece should not only reflect what's excellent and successful about you; it should also acknowledge the role that your failures have played in growing your beauty.

This is one of those rare moments when laziness can be an asset. Fate is conspiring to rejuvenate you, and all you have to do is make sure you don't get in the way. I suggest, therefore, that you follow the advice of the Zen master who said, "Don't just do something, sit there!" I mean it, Cancerian. Empty yourself of ambitions. Burn your to-do list. Tell your monkey mind you're taking a sabbatical from its obsessive leaping and shrieking. Feel absolutely no guilt as you practice the art of making yourself a tabula rasa.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

According to author Colin Wilson, synchronicities are meaningful coincidences that are created by the unconscious mind to jar the conscious mind into a keener state of perception. They imbue us with a powerful sense that there are hidden meanings beneath the surface of everyday life; they lead us to suspect that a huge, benevolent intelligence is always working behind the scenes, weaving connections that are invisible to us in our normal state of awareness. I predict that you will be awash in synchronicities in the coming week, Leo. You will get concrete proof that everything is far more intertwined than you've ever dared to imagine.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

If you want to place yourself in alignment with the current cosmic trends, you will seek out more than the usual amount and quality of your favorite physical sensations. My advice is to compose a list of your top five, then write out a proposed plan for getting those needs met and met and met. For instance, if you normally have a massage every once in a while, arrange to have at least two in the coming week, and make sure you enlist the services of the very best masseuse or masseur you know. Use the same approach to sex, food, sleep, aromas, beautiful sights, and any other experience that thrills your body.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about," wrote Libran Oscar Wilde, "and that is not being talked about." You won't have to worry about the latter problem in the next two weeks. The number of discussions about your character and behavior will probably exceed that of any other 14-day period in the past five years. Fortunately, the astrological indicators suggest that a relatively high percentage of the gossip flying around will be benevolent and even flattering. It will be a good time, therefore, for a marketing campaign or networking blitz.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

You are potentially a genius. Maybe not in the same way that Einstein and Beethoven were, but still: You possess some capacity or set of skills that is exquisitely unique. You are a work of art unlike any other that has ever lived. Furthermore, the precise instructions you need to ripen into that glorious state have always been with you, even from before you were born. In the words of psychologist James Hillman, you have a soul's code. You might also call it the master plan of your heart's deepest desire; the special mission that the Divine Wow sent you here to carry out; the blueprint that contains the secret of how to be perfectly, gracefully, unpredictably yourself. Now here's the really good news, Scorpio: You're at a turning point when you have extraordinary power to tune in to and activate untapped areas of your soul's code.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Every year the Color Marketing Group (CMG) at www.colormarketing.org issues a report that identifies the new colors coming into fashion, as well as their symbolic meaning. From their long list, I have selected the specific hues you should surround yourself with if you'd like to be in harmony with cosmic forces during the rest of 2003. 1. Lemon Meringue. "Silver flirts with gold in this zesty confection reminiscent of vintage roadsters," says CMG. 2. Shimma. "A shimmer, a shake, a lustrous flake, this pearlized metallic adds a savvy crackle to your communications." 3. Iron Ore-ange: "The influence of copper on orange creates a sophisticated background with primal undertones." 4. Exploring Khaki. "This safari green recalls rain forest moss and buried treasure."

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Given how fresh and strong you've been feeling lately, you may not be in the mood to initiate a showdown with The Problem That Refused To Die. Why risk getting demoralized by that boring old energy drain when you're so peppy? I'll tell you why: You now have a new and unprecedented advantage over The Problem That Refused To Die. You may not be able to kill it off completely, but then again you might. And you will at least be able to dramatically limit its power to mess with you.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"No work is more worthwhile than to be a sign of divine joy and a fountain of divine love." So says mystic and scholar Andrew Harvey, and I fervently agree. Not everyone is cut out for such an exacting career, of course. The pay isn't great, the hours are long, and the heroes who make it their main gig rarely get the appreciation they deserve. It's best to try it out for a while on the side without quitting your day job. Having provided those caveats, Aquarius, I'm pleased to inform you that this is the best time in years for you to work hard at being a sign of divine joy and a fountain of divine love.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Aquarius. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Your flavor of the week will be ginger peach or vanilla clove or some other blend of piquant spiciness and smooth sweetness. The kitchen accessory that best symbolizes your special skills will be a thick sponge that has an abrasive surface on one side for scrubbing dirty pots. The recurring dream you're most likely to dream for the last time, triumphing forever over the past trauma that originally spawned it, is the nightmare in which you feel like a cornered animal. Your haiku of power will be "melodious struggle where the soul turns crap into fertilizer."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Today and every day, five million lightning bolts will flash between earth and sky somewhere on our planet. At any given moment, two thousand thunderstorms are raging. While you may not be in the literal presence of one of these elemental outbreaks in the coming week, Aries, I believe you will channel a similar kind of energy: You'll be fiercely and tenderly alive with the blended force of primal fire and water. This doesn't necessarily mean you'll careen out of control; you may be able to express the booming power in its most constructive form, cleansing and clarifying everything you touch.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

My investigation of recent Taurean behavior reveals that you have committed two spankable offenses. I will not, however, authorize any enforcers to turn you over their knees and apply their palms forcefully to your buttocks -- not yet, anyway. First I want to give you a chance to atone, by filling in the gaps in your understanding and ripening the attitudes that led to your deviation from the righteous path. Or would you prefer to avoid the hard work of making amends and instead just accept a spanking?

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I should caution you that this horoscope may be banned in certain parts of Louisiana, South Dakota, and Arkansas, as well as a number of other areas around the world in which silky uproarious techniques of sacred yumyum are considered dangerous to the status quo. The fact is, Gemini, you have the potential to be a genius of love in the coming weeks. You are poised to discover higher forms of pleasure that would make plain old ordinary hedonism irrelevant. A previously unimaginable level of erotic mastery is within your reach. Now memorize this coded message: freesurgingfearlesswideawakerapturewrestler.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Your natural scent is strong and good these days. Your body is more flexible than usual and your willpower is extraordinarily supple. Even when you're tired, your voice is a healing melody; when you're well-rested, the words you express can disperse tensions that have lingered for a long time. Your ability to protect and inspire others reminds me of a mother dispensing snappy wisdom to her children. And your courage is teeming with innocent savvy. I swear you could hypnotize an agitated rattlesnake or gently crack open a closed mind.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Do you have affluenza? The PBS TV show "Affluenza" defined it as follows: the sluggish, unfulfilled feeling that results from struggling to keep up with the Joneses; the stress, overwork, waste, and indebtedness caused by an addiction to consumer goods. Signs that you suffer from this malady include the following: 1. You'll pay more for a t-shirt if it has a cool corporate logo on it. 2. You're willing to work 40 years at a job you hate so you can accumulate lots of stuff. 3. You believe that if you buy the cocktail dress, the cocktail party will come. If you have even a mild version of affluenza, Virgo, I recommend that you seek a cure in the coming days. The astrological time is ripe to learn about having fun and living successfully without spending lots of money.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

On my twentieth birthday, I found a big bag on the ground while walking across a vacant lot in Durham, NC. Odd symbols adorned the outside. Inside were taxidermically preserved specimens of a hummingbird, snake, bat, lizard, frog, and praying mantis. I brought the find home and sought the counsel of my roommate, who was knowledgeable about strange phenomena. He speculated that the animals were raw materials for a magic spell, and said the symbols were ancient alchemical formulas. Maybe it was coincidence, but the next month was a miracle. I met two new lifelong friends, discovered the person who became my greatest teacher, and got a glimpse of my life's purpose for the first time. I predict that if you're alert as you wander through the world, Libra, you will come upon a comparable good luck treasure this week.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

By a margin of 4-1, my Scorpio readers have voted to impose on me a six-week ban on all references to maddening ambiguity. You have informed me that you're weary of grappling with enigmas wrapped inside conundrums. You want earthy instructions and simple truths. Maybe I'll start obeying your orders next week, but I'd be remiss if I didn't let you know that you're about to be offered odd gifts from people in transition, benevolent interventions that require major course corrections, and mysterious help from the Great Beyond.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

To the naked eye of the casual observer, there won't seem to be enough love or money or other good stuff to go around this week. But if I'm reading the astrological omens correctly, you will be able to magically stretch and expand the resources to fulfill not only your own needs but those of a small multitude. Just assume, then, that you'll have the same mojo that Jesus allegedly had when he fed 5,000 people with five loaves of bread and two fishes.

"New studies of the brain suggest that play may be as important to life as sleeping and dreaming," writes Stuart Brown in "National Geographic." In other words, science is on the verge of confirming what we play activists have always preached: To be a healthy master of reality, you have to play every day. This is always true, of course, but it's twice as true for you right now. To make sure you know exactly what we're talking about here, Capricorn, study Brown's definition: "Play is spontaneous, pleasurable behavior that has no clear-cut goal and does not conform to a stereotypical pattern."

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Are you afraid of what you want? Are you suspicious of success? Are you suffering from a hope deficit? Do you tend to go numb when in the presence of possibilities that should excite you? Then this week will be a boon. You will have the chance to pull off a rare form of exorcism -- an exorcism not of grotesque demons and dumb-ass ghosts, but rather of the jaded cynicism that subtly corrodes your intelligence. Take this opportunity, my dear Aquarius, to cleanse yourself of the reflexive doubts that the world around you has brainwashed you into regarding as normal.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The daily grind is on the verge of crushing your spirit; you're way too close to giving in to the petty pressures of everyday insanity. In my astrological opinion, therefore, you're ready to indulge in what French poet Charles Baudelaire called "a taste for the infinite." More than that: You desperately need to cultivate a voracious hunger for the infinite. Call it going back to your spiritual roots if you like. Think of it as talking to God or expanding your consciousness or meditating till your heart melts into a state of union with your eternal source. You've got to get yourself some deep and intimate communion with the Divine Wow.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This is a perfect astrological moment for you to become more receptive, Aries. That doesn't mean you should become a lazy do-nothing bereft of goals, waiting around passively for whatever happens to come along. The receptivity I'm advocating is ferocious. It's a robust readiness to be surprised and moved; a vigorous intention to be awake to truths you don't expect and can't control. When you're truly receptive, you have strong ideas and a powerful will and a passion for disseminating your unique blessings, but you're also inspired by a humble certainty that you have a lot to learn, knowing that new teaching might come from unimaginable sources.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

During my recent visit to the Burning Man festival, I faced a dicey dilemma: what to do with my eyes as I talked with the many women who wore no clothes above the waist? At first I steadfastly kept my gaze from dipping below their necks. Then I decided that was silly; if they were strongly opposed to me looking at their breasts, they wouldn't be naked. On the other hand, I didn't want to be sneaky, stealing furtive glances when they were momentarily distracted. Ultimately, I asked each woman for permission to indulge in a brief ogle. That way we could get the issue out of the way and conduct our conversations in peace. They all thought this was a sensible approach. I hope this tale will inspire you, Taurus, to deal expeditiously with the 900-pound gorilla in the corner of your world.

"If I keep the green bough in my heart," says the Chinese proverb, "the singing bird will come." Have you been doing that, Gemini: cultivating the green bough in your heart? Even when the world around you has been a barren wasteland? If so, the singing bird will alight on your inviting perch very soon. If you haven't, get to work immediately and the singing bird may yet arrive by mid-October.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I predict that in the coming week you will be invited to partake in a mythic feast. While a gourmet meal may be involved, the essence of the experience will be metaphorical food that nourishes your soul. This uncannily satisfying sustenance will, for all intents and purposes, be a gift from eternity -- a blessing that comes from outside of time. It will be intimately meaningful for the person you are now, but even more so for the person you are striving to become.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

If you're fascinated by really big secrets, it will be a banner week for digging up suppressed evidence about the lies and deceptions your government is trying to get away with. If mid-sized secrets are more your style, it'll be a good time to uncover the inner workings of your social circle, place of employment, or local scene. And if you're the kind of person who gets most turned on by small, subtle secrets, this is a perfect moment to find out what you've been hiding from yourself.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Please remember that you are not competing in a sprint, Virgo. You are running a marathon. You should therefore be sure to pace yourself and not be overly concerned about the fast-starters who have sped ahead of you. I also advise you to clear your beautiful mind of envy and self-doubt, as well as the pushy expectations of people who don't know the intricacies of what you're doing. Now here's the most important thing: Use your fine mind to figure out how to be motivated by pleasure, not pressure.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Here are tasks you should studiously avoid in the coming week: painting the bathroom, fixing the smoke alarm, changing the burned-out light in the hallway, getting an air freshener for the car, and buying new batteries for the TV remote control. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you should instead seek out the following kinds of experiences: Delight in your sudden access to spiritual resources that have been closed to you before; commune with beauty that does not depend on artifice; and capitalize on your new ability to change something about your life that you thought would remain stuck forever.

On the eve of the American Revolution in 1775, Paul Revere rode his horse from Charlestown to Lexington, MA, warning the local population that an invasion force of British troops was on its way. Last night I dreamed you were like a modern Paul Revere, only instead of yelling "The British are coming!," you were shouting "The smiling agents of confusion are coming!" What do you think that means, Scorpio? Here's one conceivable dream interpretation: In your waking life, you should expose the dangers posed by fuzzy-brained catalysts, no matter how well-intentioned they might seem. Here's another possible interpretation: Be on the lookout for polite manipulators who use their sweet charm to get their selfish way.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

My friend Jane Heaven lives by a motto that would be a good tonic for you this week: "the ruthless truth, kindly told." In other words, it won't be smart or effective for you merely to expose the sticky subtexts that everyone's trying to avoid dealing with. You'll have to convey those unsettling revelations with all the tender compassion you can muster. Expressions of tough love will be half-assed unless the love is at least twice as big as the toughness.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"Artist Jeff Koons, author Martin Amis, and musician Sean 'Puffy' Combs once had a genius for knowing how the times were changing," wrote Nicholas Blincoe in "Black Book" magazine. "They always managed to stay ahead of the curve. Then, suddenly, instead of surfing the waves, they scrambled for dry land. Each tried to conjure up stability and solidity through more and more monumental undertakings. They lost their former lightness and fluidity, becoming mired in pomposity." This is a worthy meditation for you, Capricorn. Every successful person, you and I included, has to periodically negotiate the turning point that Koons, Amis, and Combs seem to have failed to master. We're all tempted to cling to the winning formula that brought us so far. But this is a perfect time to release your attachment to and dependence on your past triumphs, and go off in quest of fresh magic.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

It'll be a good week to do all of the following: play soccer in the kitchen with Barbie doll heads; wake up in the morning to salsa music and start dancing while you're still half-asleep; talk about your problems until you've talked them to death; get the equivalent of a first kiss or a last laugh; seek out a mystical sign from an enigmatic saint wearing black gloves and a wry smile; call yourself Mumso, Mutiny, or Goofmaster as you upgrade your graffiti-scrawling skills; join Charles M. Young's campaign to change the name of the Pentagon to the "Emma Goldman World Cathedral of Ecofeminist Goddess Worship;" and be a vivid embodiment of Deena Metzger's idea that "Beauty appears when something is completely and absolutely and openly itself."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Have you ever played the game of "Tell me the story of all your scars?" It's best to do it when you want to break through to a deeper level of intimacy with a friend or loved one. "How'd you get that blotch on your knee?" he or she begins, and you describe the time in childhood when you fell out of a tree onto the sidewalk. Then maybe he or she says, "Why do you always look so sad when you hear that song on the radio?" And you narrate the tale of how it was playing when an old flame broke your heart. The questions and answers continue until you unveil the entire history of your hurts, both physical and psychic. I suggest you treat yourself to this ritual in the coming week, Pisces. The astrological omens suggest you can achieve a miraculous healing in the presence of a good listener who is curious about your mysteries and skilled at helping you find redemption in your wounds.

My acquaintance Delilah is a leftwing pagan hippie who makes big bucks working as an X-ray technician in a large hospital. She's a pacifist, but serves as president of the local chapter of the American Legion, an organization for military veterans. She has been engaged forever to a dreadlocked man 25 years her senior, though he looks her age because he has practiced sex magic and eaten nothing but wheat grass and lived outside for decades; on the other hand, she loves to flirt with young businessmen with buzz cuts. Delilah is your role model and patron saint for the coming week, Aries. Like her, you can and should be a cheerful master of contradictions.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Of the many brave adventurers I met during my recent visit to the Burning Man festival, Tauruses comprised a large proportion. One example was Melissa Whitman, who leaves soon for a year-long stay in Madagascar, where she'll be the only female and English-speaker among a team working to save the scops owl from extinction. Though she's afraid of heights, she'll have to climb tall trees at night to study the birds in their natural habitat. Another courageous Taurus was Jennifer from Napa, CA, an art therapist for the criminally insane. She risks her life daily. Why did I encounter so many daring Bulls? Is it because the expansive planet Jupiter is cruising through your astrological House of Extravagant Self-Expression? Whatever the cause, I urge you to sync up with the audacious vibes now available to your tribe.

In her book, Simply Sophisticated: What Every Worldly Person Needs to Know, Suzanne Munshower lists the requirements for an elegant home. You should have at least one needlepoint pillow, she says. The thread count of your sheets should be 200 per inch or more. Your bookcases, if visible to guests, must have no paperbacks, and your bathroom accessories should be ceramic. Now that you've heard Munshower's ideas, Gemini, please rebel against them. According to my analysis of the astrological omens, you'll put yourself in alignment with current cosmic rhythms if you add elements to your home to make it more playful and less formal, more in tune with what delights you and less concerned with what others think.

In its original use, the phrase "priming the pump" referred to the fact that a hand-operated water pump didn't provide a steady, abundant flow of water until you first lubricated it with a little water. In modern parlance, it's often a way of saying that to make money you have to invest some, or that in order to get lots of goodies you have to give some. To take maximum advantage of the current astrological potentials, Cancerian, regard "priming the pump" as your metaphor of power.

When I'm not writing this horoscope column, I pursue a career as a performance artist. For a recent show, I bought eight jars of pigs' feet at the grocery store, 200 pair of white underpants at Costco, and twenty alarm clocks at the drugstore. None of the clerks who took my money expressed the slightest interest in the reasons for my peculiar and prodigious orders. Their numbness was deeply disturbing to me. How could they have so thoroughly repressed their natural curiosity? In the coming week, Leo, you must avoid behavior like that. Awaken your innocent longing to know everything you can about the unexpected marvels that life brings.

The last surprise I saw before heading home was among the most modest, but it's a perfect choice to serve as your ruling symbol for the coming week: a sign that read "The Very Tidy Pirates" above an image of a bad-ass dude wearing an eye patch and apron and wielding a vacuum cleaner and feather duster.

When you have achieved great victories in the past, Libra, they have often happened because of your graceful willpower or fine intelligence.

Beginnings and endings will be overlapping in the near future, Scorpio. They will demand that you grow rapidly. It won't always be easy to tell them apart, either; you'll have to become wiser faster in order to understand the clues. Here are two meditations to guide you: 1. Which of the long-running dramas of your life have run their course? 2. What struggling dreams are aching to resurrect themselves and bloom again as if for the first time? Once you figure out the answers to those questions, act dynamically to nurture what's being born and expedite the dissolution of what's dying.

"Dear Dr. Brezsny: With the help of a flood of pithy coincidences, I've become aware that the Universal Mind recently lost Her train of thought. I believe we are now under the care of a substitute 'Universal Mind,' and that therefore the laws of karma are not being enforced as strictly as usual. Cosmic SLACK is available in extravagant amounts. Tell your readers so they may take advantage of it by aggressively reconfiguring their little slice of reality to reflect their deepest needs. -Opportunistic Sagittarius"
	Dear Opportunistic: Good catch. I totally agree with your assessment, especially as it applies to you Sagittarians. As you suggest, karma now has a reduced power to whip your fate this way and that; your willpower has more room than usual in which to maneuver. I call this phase "Freedom from Cosmic Compulsion."

To borrow a phrase from the old astrology columnist Stella Spambottom, this is a week you could make the boogie man cry. That's because your anger is smarter and your fears are weaker than they've been in many moons. You also have access to a high level of courage, which is made even more potent by the fact that it's rooted in quiet confidence, not blustering egotism. As you fight evil in the coming days, your forceful actions will no doubt be fair and enlightened. On behalf of the cosmic powers, therefore, I authorize you to induce tears in boogie men, out-of-control tyrants, and the devil himself.

Every August, the temporary city of Burning Man sprouts up in the Nevada desert. Upwards of 30,000 freaks and mutants drop their inhibitions for a week as they interact with entertaining rituals that transpire in hundreds of "theme camps." If you ever go, you'll be able to eat fresh sushi off the naked bellies of clowns posing as supermodels, play a giant game of billiards using bowling balls, and take a joyride on a wheeled version of Captain Hook's schooner as it sways with scores of sweaty dancers dressed like characters from your dreams. Unfortunately, Burning Man won't come around again until August 23, 2004, but you need to have your mind blown and blown and blown now. Find a worthy substitute.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Every act of genius, said psychologist Carl Jung, is an act contra naturam: "against nature." Indeed, every effort to achieve psychological integration requires a knack for breaking out of the trance of normal daily life. Eighteenth-century mystic Jacob Boehme agreed. The great secret of divine magic, he asserted, is "to walk in all things contrary to the world." My teacher, Paul Foster Case, believed that living an ethical and enlightened life required one to reverse the usual ways of thinking, speaking, and doing. What's your position on this approach, Pisces? It's prime time for you to redefine your relationship with what I call sacred rebellion.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

A study by psychologists at the University of Sussex in Great Britain has found that taking part in protests, demonstrations, or strikes is good for you. Interviews with activists revealed that participants experienced a deep sense of happiness and even euphoria in being involved in such events. By my astrological reckoning, this will be especially true for you Aries in the coming weeks. If you haven't already found a constructive channel for your rebellious mojo, start searching now.

 "Both Picasso and T.S. Eliot are credited with saying, 'Good artists borrow, great artists steal,'" notes music critic Peter Gorman. "Credit it to Picasso and it comes across as bravado, a declaration that great art comes from those who appropriate whatever they damn well please. Credit the quote to Eliot and it seems more like word play; to borrow is to imitate and give back, to steal is to make it one's own." Study these tricky assertions about the creative process, Taurus. They should incite provocative meditations as you negotiate a turning point in your relationship with your own fertility.

Trains in China are divided into two different sections: soft seats and hard seats. "The soft seats are usually where you find the richer, stiffer, better-educated people," reports Charlotte Temple in DoubleTake magazine. "In the hard-seat section, it's like a little village. Everyone is eating watermelon seeds, playing games, leaning out windows to buy from the dumpling sellers." I bring this up, Gemini, because it's an apt metaphor for the choice you now face. As you travel on to the next phase of your life, the soft seats would provide the greatest comfort, but the most interesting and educational events would unfold in the hard seats.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Gemini. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

You've heard of passive smoking, which occurs when the burning cigarette wastes of smokers snake into the lungs of innocent bystanders. Now scientists at the Beauty and Truth Lab have identified a phenomenon they call second-hand depression, wherein victims inadvertently absorb the misery and cynicism of people who are spewing out negative emotions. You Cancerians must be especially careful to protect yourself against that contamination in the coming week. You can't afford to be poisoned by the lazy blather of out-of-control naysayers. Why? Because you have an astrological mandate to nurture optimistic perceptions and articulate loving strategies that uplift everyone whose life you touch.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

On an episode of the TV science fiction show "Stargate SG-1," friendly aliens called the Asgards come to Earth seeking help from the top-secret government agency with whom they've had a working relationship. It seems the super-intelligent, highly evolved Asgards have reached a dead end in their ability to fend off their mortal enemy, the Replicators. They hope their dumb allies, the humans, will be able to find some elementary solution that they themselves are too smart and complicated to think of. The idea works. One of Earth's top physicists, a simpleton by Asgard standards, dreams up a crude but effective plan. Let this be a teaching tale for you in the coming week, Leo. Trust innocent, uncluttered, amateur solutions.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

The largest meeting of world religious leaders in history was virtually unreported by the media. The top-secret event transpired in 2002, when leading representatives from every major faith gathered in Italy. They issued a "Decalogue for Peace," which denounced violence committed in the name of God and religion. It also declared, "We commit ourselves to those who suffer poverty and abandonment and who have no voice." The media deemed many other stories more important than this unprecedented breakthrough, like Mike Tyson getting his boxing license, John Walker Lindh making a court appearance, and the Enron hearings beginning. I bring this up, Virgo, because a comparable marvel is unfolding in your own life, and you haven't noticed it yet. 

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Virgo. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"You're only given a little spark of madness," says Robin Williams. "You mustn't lose it." His advice is especially apt for you now. To aid your efforts, here are tips on how to keep a healthy level of insanity, by librarian Bonnie Wolf. 1. When people ask you to do something, ask if they want fries with that. 2. Have your coworkers address you by your wrestling name, Rock Hard Kim. 3. As often as possible, skip rather than walk.  4. Finish all your sentences with "in accordance with the prophecy." 5. Ask people what sex they are. Laugh hysterically after they answer. 6. Page yourself over the intercom. Don't disguise your voice. 7. At lunchtime, sit in your parked car with sunglasses on and point a hair dryer at passing cars. See if they slow down. 8. In the memo field of all your checks, write "for sexual favors." 9. When the money comes out of the ATM, scream "I won! I won! Third time this week!" 10. Put your garbage can on your desk and label it "in." 11. Put mosquito netting around your work area. Play a tape of jungle sounds all day. 12. Dont use any punctuation marks 13. Specify that your drive-through order is "to go." 14. When leaving the zoo, start running towards the parking lot, yelling "run for your lives, they're loose!" 15. Tell your children over dinner, "Due to the economy, we are going to have to let one of you go." 16. Put decaf in the coffee maker for three weeks. Once everyone has gotten over their caffeine addictions, switch to espresso.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

A few years ago the astronomy magazine "Sky & Telescope" held a contest to replace the name "Big Bang," which many scientists regarded as too frivolous. This week I propose that you Scorpios carry out a comparable project: Find a new name for the Divine Intelligence. The terms "God" and even "Goddess" have been so abused and overused that we've all become numb to them. And given the spiritual opportunities that will be opening up for you in the coming weeks, you can't afford to have an impaired sensitivity towards the Great Mystery. Here are a few ideas to whet your imagination: Blooming HaHa, Whirl-Zap-Gush, Sublime Cackler, Primal Jokester, Cosmic Wow, Eternal Crucible.

No one knows you better than you do, Scorpio. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

For almost 60 years, Simon Wiesenthal tracked down Nazis responsible for the Holocaust. His most famous catch was Adolf Eichman, but he also brought more than a thousand other war criminals to justice. He recently retired. "My work is done," the tireless 94-year-old crusader said. "I found the mass murderers I was looking for. I survived all of them." I hereby appoint Wiesenthal to be your role model, Sagittarius. The astrological omens suggest that the coming months will be a perfect time for you to home in on a passionate, righteous commitment that will fuel you for years.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The ozone hole is shrinking and will recover. Current human life expectancy, already at age 84, is steadily increasing. Since 1993, the violent crime rate in the U.S. has decreased by 50 percent. The number of America's black elected officials has sextupled since 1970. The planet is steadily becoming more free: 89 democratic countries control 89 percent of the world's GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Birthrates for teenagers are at the lowest levels in over 60 years. Charitable giving by individuals has increased 180 percent between 1960. Worldwide, the percentage of children enrolled in secondary education has more than doubled since 1970. In other words, Capricorn, life on earth is much better than everyone assumes. Inspired by my shocking evidence, compose a similar list of everything that's going really well for you.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

In the coming week, Aquarius, you're in danger of seeing with your imagination rather than with your eyes; you'll be tempted to trust the power of your beliefs more than the evidence of your five senses. It is possible to avert that fate, however. To assist you, I'm happy to provide this curmudgeonly prod from journalist H.L. Mencken: "An idealist is one who, on noticing that a rose smells better than a cabbage, concludes that it will also make better soup."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You have done without it long enough, Pisces. This state of deprivation can't go on. Up till now there's been a certain value in you not having the stuff you've been aching for, but as of now its continued absence would begin to have a soul-shriveling effect. Therefore, on behalf of cosmic forces, I hereby authorize you to take all necessary steps, as long as they're ethical, to get the goodies. You may even resort to the desperate pleading that kids use on their parents to get a beloved treat at the grocery store, including: "I promise to be good," "I'll never ask for anything again," and "I NEED IT!!!!"

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I'm not saying you're depressed, Aries, nor am I predicting you will be. But you are in an astrological phase when you're more susceptible than usual to that feeling. Having issued that warning, however, let me add that I think being depressed would actually be very good news. It would mean you're on the verge of a creative breakdown that will inevitably lead to a liberating breakthrough. To be perfectly candid, I hope you do give yourself the luxury of experiencing deflation. 

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Aries. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The American Journal of Psychiatry says that many people suffer from delusions of "imagined ugliness." The technical name for the condition is "body dysmorphic disorder." It's typically characterized by an obsession with a physical flaw, or even with an imagined flaw. Judging from my experience, 99 percent of the population has at least a mild version of this pathology. That's the bad news, Taurus. The good news is that you're in a perfect astrological phase to break free from its hold. You're ready to revolutionize your self-image so thoroughly that you will hereafter see yourself as a perfect specimen of idiosyncratic beauty.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"Ninety-six percent of the cosmos puzzles astronomers. The universe is made mostly of dark matter and dark energy, which the experts can't even detect, let alone study." When I read that news story on the CNN website, I let out a whoop of celebration. Our culture's equivalents of high priests, the scientists, were flat-out admitting that the subject they know best is mostly a mystery to them. I hope, Gemini, that this will give you the freedom to feel at peace with the enigmas at the core of your personal life. Curiously, your courage to "dwell comfortably in the midst of profound uncertainty" (poet John Keats' phrase) will be the key to you receiving a crucial revelation about where you need to go next.

Researchers with too much time on their hands have calculated that William Shakespeare used 20,140 words in his written works. More than eight percent of those were brand new terms that he dreamed up. Some of the best: besmirch, domineering, dwindle, frugal, gnarled, hobnob, lackluster, madcap, pander, sanctimonious, tranquil, gossip, and leapfrog. While we can't expect you to reach Shakespearian levels in the coming week, the astrological omens do suggest you will have more verbal creativity than you've had in many moons. I suggest you speak the truths your heart has never had words for. Assume that your powers of persuasion will be twice as great as usual, and invent at least 20 new words.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Cancerian. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Your risk for getting Alzheimer's disease diminishes as you smoke more cigarettes. Air pollution keeps your skin youthful by blocking out the sunlight that would age it. Atomic fallout can help prevent dandruff. So does that mean you should puff on two packs a day, hang out in the smoggiest parts of the earth, and hope for the resumption of hydrogen bomb tests in the atmosphere? Of course not. Likewise, Leo, don't prop up your bad habits and rationalize nasty influences with ass-backwards theories about why they're good for you.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

What if I suggested that you can, beyond any doubt, make your unique dream come true, but that it will take years of hard work, periods of deprivation, and bouts with frustrating confusion before you succeed? Would you rearrange your priorities in order to pursue that dream with all your ingenuity? Or would you give up on it and go looking for an easier assignment that provided you with more security? During the coming weeks, the time will be ripe to go one way or the other.

No one knows you better than you do, Virgo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Promise me that you will never use astrology as an excuse to avoid taking responsibility for your decisions. Always keep in mind that the planets don't determine your fate. It¬ís true, however, that analyzing their positions can help you know when and how to clarify your choices. For instance, my reading of the current omens suggests to me that if you continue to let things slide, if you keep postponing action, you'll fall under the spell of a funky malaise. If, on the other hand, you bolster your commitment to what you love, you'll not only ward off debilitation -- you'll feel more robust than you have in a long time.

According to historian Thomas Fleming, in the early part of his career George Washington was a brilliant spy. "He ran espionage rings in British-held New York and Philadelphia," says Fleming. "The man who supposedly could not tell a lie was a genius at disinformation." Later, of course, Washington became the head of the first United States government, where he conducted himself more straightforwardly. The way I see your life right now, Scorpio, you're ready to negotiate a transition analogous to the one George Washington made. Is there a situation where you have been a master of stealth and surreptitious strategy? That's exactly where you should now act with articulate candor and forthright leadership.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

This would be a good time to conduct a midnight ritual in Machu Picchu, the lost city of the Incas in the Andes Mountains. Fate will also smile upon you if you undertake a pilgrimage of healing to Chartres Cathedral in France, or circumnavigate Tibet's sacred mountain, Mt. Kailash, or seek out a Siberian shaman for a week of fasting, praying, and soul retrieval. I suggest, however, that you balance these starry-eyed quests with more down-to-earth spiritual actions. For instance, you might make amends to the person you have treated most unfairly in your life.

The Museum of Make Believe features artifacts from nursery rhymes, fairy tales, and classical literature. Among its treasures are Snow White's mirror, Jack and Jill's notorious pail, the baseball mitt from The Catcher in the Rye, and the tools Geppetto used to create his wooden son Pinocchio. I suggest you draw inspiration from this museum in the coming week, Capricorn. The astrological omens say you will have great success in translating your imaginative ideas into concrete reality.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

I fear that you aren't making yourself sufficiently available. The cosmos is in an increasingly generous mood towards you, but you've erected psychic barriers that are preventing the fullness of the blessings from reaching you. Here's an idea for how to shift the energy: Wrap two empty boxes in festive paper, ribbons, and bows. Place them in a prominent place in your home; on your altar if you have one. Then gaze at these packages meditatively for ten minutes a day, visualizing what gifts you'd like to be inside and rehearsing the feeling of intense gratitude.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In recent years, a tradition of guerrilla art has broken out in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. Seattle has become the latest beneficiary of the covert movement to beautify America with free sculptures. The Seattle Times reported that one night unknown creators swooped down on a caf√© in a crime-ridden area, leaving behind a handcrafted table and chairs. On top of the table was a vase filled with flowers. One seat, a metal trunk that opened, contained vintage playing cards and a game. I hope this whets your appetite for benevolent pranks, Pisces. The best way to align yourself with cosmic law right now is to give unpredictable gifts to as many people as possible, even strangers.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Mars is now closer to Earth than it has been in 60,000 years. It's shining 85 times brighter than it did a year ago, and it will be the single most brilliant light in the night sky this week. Is the red planet therefore beaming an intensified dose of its charismatic, melodramatic Martian vibrations at us? Will our libidos feel as if they've been supercharged? I suspect so. Psychotherapists everywhere may be besieged by clients who don't know how to handle the gift of wildly enhanced vitality. I doubt there'll be many complaints from you Aries folks, though: Mars is your ruling planet. While other signs may be held hostage by lust, anger, competition, and blind ambition, you'll know exactly what to do with all that extra mojo.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

This week Mars is closer to Earth than it has been since cavemen roamed the earth. It also happens to be midway through a five-month sojourn in your astrological House of Networking, which is its longest stay since 1956. Because the red planet invigorates everything it influences, you could very well be a whiz at winning friends and influencing people from now until December. But keep in mind that unless you respond with all your passionate ingenuity to the arousing Martian energy, it may also have a disruptive effect. Here's your rule of thumb: Go all the way, give everything you have, and don't hold back.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Do you think you'd enjoy being able to focus all your ambitions in one overarching dream? Can you imagine what it might be like not to feel your desires split in five different directions? While your predilection for versatility and vacillation isn't necessarily a bad thing, Gemini, it might be interesting at some point in your life to explore the ferocious pleasures of single-mindedness. It so happens that now is a perfect moment to launch such an exploration. Mars, the planet that rules willpower and determination, is currently expressing tremendous force in your astrological House of Total Commitment. There has rarely been a better time for you to stabilize your purpose and steel your resolve.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The largest mountain on Mars, Olympus Mons, is almost three times the size of Mount Everest. It should serve as your sacred symbol of power in the coming months. Why? Because the red planet is now pouring extra mojo into your astrological House of Exploration, and will continue to do so through mid-December. You will have the ability to pull off frontier adventures that are equivalent to climbing to the top of Olympus Mons. For a picture of Olympus Mons, go here.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

It's a perfect moment to purge romantic karma left over from the old days. You shouldn't go another week without doing a ritual to dissolve the bad memories, lingering resentments, and ancient wounds that have continued to tweak your intimate relationships. It's also prime time to kill off your outdated dogmas about gender roles and to blow up any obstacles that interfere with your ability to experience total sexual pleasure. How can I be so sure you're ready for these fate-mutating transitions? Mars, the planet of creative destruction, is currently bringing its tough love to your astrological House of Sexy Emotions. I predict that it will liberate you from influences that prevent you from finding more beautiful and flagrant ways to enjoy your libido.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Astronomers are uncertain about how brightly Mars will glow in the sky this week. It'll be as close as it ever gets to both the Earth and sun, and should theoretically be a dazzling beacon. But there's a possibility that huge dust storms will sweep the planet, increasing its reflectivity and boosting its illumination even further. Due to astrological factors that would take too long to explain here, I predict that you Virgos will be as shiny and brilliant as Mars, and that any storms passing your way will only make you shinier and more brilliant.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Virgo. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Mars is not only a heavenly body, but also an aspect of your psyche. Your inner Mars consists of your ambition, animal energy, willpower, and sex drive. By reading the movements of the red planet in the sky, we astrologers can make educated guesses about the state of the Mars force within you. Here's my analysis: Your ambition will get back on track now if you give it a chiropractic-like adjustment; your animal energy will return to full vitality if you stop doing the careless thing that's weakening it; your willpower has been muted by the consequences of a past mistake, but you now have the insight to correct the mistake; your sex drive is not as pure and strong as it could be, but will become so if you will just get clearer about what really turns you on.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Michel Gauquelin (1928-1991) was a French statistician and psychologist who set out to prove astrology is bunk. To his surprise, he found some scientific evidence demonstrating its validity. One striking discovery was the Mars Effect: There is a significant probability of world-class athletes and military leaders being born when the red planet is rising in the sky. I believe you Scorpios are now benefiting from a variation on this phenomenon. Mars, which is one of your astrological rulers, is closer to Earth than it has been in 60,000 years. It is also in the midst of a rare five-month visit to your House of Creative Self-Expression. I believe that not only means you are extra fertile; you're also at the peak of your physical vigor and your ability to emerge victorious in competitive struggles.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You and your tribe are the restless explorers of the zodiac, Sagittarius. Your wanderlust sometimes becomes so consuming that you forget how important it is to have a home base. And when you suffer from that delusion, you aren't likely to devote much creativity to keeping your foundations strong. Luckily, you're now in a phase when you can't possibly get away with this ignorance. The energizing planet Mars is stirring up a flood of feelings and ideas about what you need to sustain you -- and how to take good care of it.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Sagittarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Alert! Mars is extremely up-close and personal right now. Not since the time of the Neanderthals has the red planet veered so near to the Earth. In cosmic terms, it's practically on top of us, ladies and gentlemen. It's in our faces. It's forcing us to deal with its favorite agendas. What that means for you Capricorns is that you'd better communicate with concise candor in all matters related to your ambitions and sexuality. Find a way to express your burning desires with uncompromising integrity.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Mars is closer to Earth right now than it has been since the Old Stone Age. At the same time, amazingly enough, it's also making its nearest approach to the sun. As a result, we're able to get our best look ever at the melting of the red planet's south polar cap. This rare confluence provides a good metaphor for the effect that the intensified Martian vibes are likely to have on you as they impact your astrological House of Finances and Possessions. I believe your frozen assets are about to thaw.

No one knows you better than you do, Aquarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Mars usually cruises through a sign in five to eight weeks, but it has been in Pisces since June 16 and will remain there until December 16 -- its longest stay since 1956. But that's not all: Mars is now closer to Earth than it has been in 60,000 years. During this unprecedented convergence of unusual events, I predict that your relationship with the red planet will be more intense and intimate than it ever has been. Here are some of the tasks you can expect cosmic assistance with: discovering secrets about how to ask forcefully for what you really want; making your strategies for success more foolproof and irresistible; and getting very clear about the life goals that are most important for you to pursue in the next ten years.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Warning! The following statements may pop into your head with annoying frequency in the coming week: "Nobody sees me for who I really am." "Life is a bitch." "Sooner or later, everyone will find out how I've been faking it all these years." "I'll never have enough money." "I'm afraid to change even when I know the change will be good." Now listen closely, Aries: All those ideas are dirty lies. I don't believe in the devil, but if I did I'd say it was he who planted them in your mind. How can you fight back? Wage a ferocious campaign of positive self-talk. Barrage yourself with uplifting affirmations like these: "I face my fears with joyous courage." "I turn apparent setbacks into juicy opportunities." "I answer every criticism with a vow to be my best." "I am an amazingly gorgeous genius with unimaginable tricks up my sleeve."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

I'm not necessarily suggesting you need a new soul mate. But if you do, this is the perfect astrological moment to go in search of one. Where should you look? I suggest you hang out in unfamiliar territory where you will be fresh and curious -- frontier zones where you're likely to uncover secrets about who you really are. For fastest results, visit the Costco Soulmate Trading Outlet, a clearinghouse for soul mates at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert from August 25-31. It offers "quality name-brand and private-label soul mates at substantially lower prices than can be found through conventional wholesale sources." P.S. If you're happy with your existing soul mate, infuse your bond with a concentrated dose of smart, loving creativity. It's a perfect moment to propel yourselves into the next phase of your evolution together.

Robust singing skill is correlated with a strong immune system in songbirds. Male birds with the most extensive repertoire of tunes also have the largest spleens, a key measure of immune system health. No studies have yet been done on humans. But if there is a similar link, I expect you will be crooning with unrivaled beauty and power in the coming days. The astrological omens say you are currently at the peak of your ability to fight off bugs and adversaries of all kinds, including both the physical and psychic varieties.

So begins the information-gathering phase of your yearly cycle, Cancerian. You'll align yourself with the cosmic ebb and flow whenever you engage in activities that excite your love of learning and enhance your skills as a student of life. Here's a gem from poet Heather McHugh to inspire your quest: "The knowledge I'm interested in is not something you buy and then have and can be comfortable with. The knowledge I'm interested in keeps opening wider and wider, making me smaller and more amazed, until I see I cannot have it all -- and then delight in that as a freedom."

Please muse a minute on the title of a book by Susan Harrow: Selling Yourself Without Selling Your Soul: A Woman's Guide to Promoting Herself, Her Business, Her Product, or Her Cause with Integrity and Spirit. I suggest you either consult this invigorating set of instructions, which works for men, too, or else create your own version of it. The astrological omens reveal you're primed to receive fresh intuitions about how to make money from doing what you love. (P.S. I don't know Harrow personally and have no financial stake in her book.)

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"You have to recognize the demons or else they'll annoy you like mosquitoes," poet James Broughton told interviewer Jack Foley. "But if you acknowledge their existence, if you say, 'All right, here's a cookie, go sit in the corner,' then you can go about your work and you don't have to go into depression because of it." I suggest you follow Broughton's advice, Libra. Neither ignore nor over-indulge those pesky voices in your head.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Libra. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

The Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, TX has a standing offer to its customers: If you can eat its four and a half pound steak in an hour without getting sick, the meal is free. Oh, and you've also got to finish the side dishes -- salad, shrimp cocktail, baked potato, and roll. Only about one in six brave souls succeeds at the test. Given your tribe's current astrological omens, however, I think five out of six Scorpios could win the bet this week. Your appetite -- not just for food, but for pleasure, wisdom, adventure, and self-transformation -- is gargantuan.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

History is littered with the stories of people who didn't have sufficient funds to manifest their brilliant ideas. Mahlon Loomis was one. Guglielmo Marconi is known as the inventor of the radio, but Loomis created a wireless telegraph system two years before Marconi was even born. Unable to get financial backing, however, Loomis could not develop his innovation, and it remained a virtual secret. I'm hoping, Sagittarius, that this story will prod you into realizing how important it is to feed your own dreams with all the money they deserve. Don't let them languish in the realm of fantasy.

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

This Saturday I'll leave for a visit to my version of paradise: the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. For eight utopian days, I'll need no money and see no advertisements or TV. Exuberant works of art, erected in abundance throughout the seven-square-mile expanse, will feed my imagination. Half-naked dancing revelers who share my political and spiritual views will greet me everywhere I go. I'll do workshops and performances for people who appreciate my peculiar brand of crazy wisdom. I bring this up, Capricorn, because I think you would benefit from a similar escape. It's a perfect moment to make a pilgrimage to the place you consider heaven on earth.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Bach's "St. Matthew Passion" is one of the most highly regarded musical compositions in history. Yet the score disappeared and the work was never played for many years after Bach's death in 1750. In 1829, composer Felix Mendelssohn rediscovered the long-lost manuscript being used as wrapping paper in the estate sale of a deceased cheese salesman. He arranged for a public performance of the piece, and its revival began. In the coming week, Aquarius, I predict you'll have a taste of the amazed and confounded joy Mendelssohn must have experienced. In an unlikely place with seemingly low value, you will find a neglected treasure.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Your thought for the week comes from French writer Alexander Dumas. "If you give the impression that you need something, you will get nothing," he said. "To make money you have to appear to be rich." The best way to get what you desire, in other words, is to be confident that you deserve it. Don't dwell on how needy you are; don't let yourself become a morass of aching deficiency. This doesn't mean you should water down the intensity of your longing. Indeed, passionate yearning is essential for bountiful satisfaction. But make sure your intense longing is propelled by a certainty that you will ultimately be fulfilled.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

If you're single, this is the most favorable time in many moons to try creating a harem for yourself. You're even more attractive than usual, and the cosmos has decreed that what might have been greedy in the past is just right now. If you're in an interesting monogamous relationship, on the other hand, don't mess it up with fantasies of polyamory. Instead, brainstorm with your partner about how you could provide more variety for each other. Dress up in different roles, for instance. Speak with funny accents, invent new names, or pretend you're living in another historical period. How would you do your love dance if you were members of the French Resistance in World War II or escaped American slaves headed for freedom circa 1863?

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

If you're typical, your memory is not very efficient; by tomorrow at this time you will have forgotten much of what you learned today. But you cannot afford to be typical during the next ten days, Taurus. It's crucial to the ultimate success of your long-term dreams that you remember far more than you usually do. I don't care how you do it: Intensify your perceptiveness, try memory-strengthening exercises, take massive doses of ginkgo biloba, or all of the above. Become as aggressively receptive and absorptive as you have ever dared to be.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Can you be a dissatisfied rebel and exuberant lover of life at the same time? Can you identify all the things that are wrong without losing your bemused tolerance? I think you can, especially this week. You won't have any role models to draw from, though, so you'll have to trust your intuition and the following advice: Be a happy bitch! A playful protester! A sweet-tempered complainer! The goodies will come to you if you overthrow the status quo with inventiveness and compassion.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Gemini. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I'm sure you've had the experience of a song popping into your head and refusing to leave, as if it had taken one of your brain circuits hostage. Usually it's a catchy tune you've heard recently on the radio, but now and then it's an old song you haven't thought of in a long time. The former is a nuisance, but the latter may be an oracular message from your unconscious mind -- a helpful hint, like a vivid dream, that can clue you in to a not-yet-fully-bloomed truth. I predict you will be the lucky recipient of such an oracle at least twice in the coming week.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Just assume you're a prime example of F. Scott Fitzgerald's belief that "If you're strong enough, there are no precedents." You have permission from the cosmos to make that assumption. You'll also be perfectly justified, Leo, in expecting the fire in your belly to grow bigger and hotter. Given the exceptional amounts of willpower you'll be able to channel in the coming days, it may even make sense for you to wear a ring with a symbolic thunderbolt and refer to yourself with the royal "we."

No one knows you better than you do, Leo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Pablo Picasso had a difficult birth. When he finally popped out after a long labor, he wasn't breathing. The midwife decided his face was so blue he'd be impossible to revive. She declared him dead and left. But Picasso's uncle, who was in attendance, got up close to the infant and puffed cigar smoke up his nose. That was the shock that brought him to life. I expect that a metaphorically analogous wake-up call will resurrect you from your soul numbness in the coming week, Virgo.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Give yourself a treat you've been denying yourself far too long. Get a friend to give you a ride in a wheelbarrow. Use one of your so-called flaws strategically. Have a staring contest with a snake. Take shopping lessons from an expert. Using a felt-tip pen, inscribe a sacred poem or symbol on a new pair of underpants, thereby transforming it into your special magic underwear that will make intriguing things happen whenever you wear them. Whisper a taboo secret while moving very fast, preferably on a roller coaster. Say a rowdy prayer each time you lick a Tootsie Roll Pop, and don't stop until you reach the center. Round up someone ¬ñ- pay him or her if necessary -- to be your yes-man or yes-woman for 24 hours.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

After studying the cosmic omens, I realized I'd be unable to glean your oracle until I was standing on holy ground. I left immediately for Spirit Rock Meditation Center, a Buddhist sanctuary near my home. There I sought out the outdoor prayer wheel, a brightly painted wooden cylinder inscribed with noble phrases like "wise speech" and "wise intention." Buddhists believe that when this ritual device is spun on its axis, spiritual blessings are cast in all directions. As I reached for one of the handles to give it a whirl, I spied an awesome sight: Four salamanders had arrayed themselves on the section of the wheel that read "wise livelihood." I knew I'd found my message for you, Scorpio. This week, do everything possible to get closer to making your money by serving your highest ideals.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In 1977, English professor Coleman Barks had a dream that changed his life. In the dream, he was relaxing on a riverbank near his childhood home in Georgia. A ball of light floated towards him. It contained a man with his head bowed and eyes closed, sitting cross-legged and wearing a white shawl. The man raised his head, opened his eyes, and said, "I love you," and Barks answered, "I love you, too." Some time after this dream, he met the same mysterious figure in waking life. It was a Sri Lankan holy man, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, who ultimately set Barks on the path to becoming a translator of the dead mystic poet Rumi. Today Rumi's books are bestsellers, largely due to Barks. I predict you will soon have a dream with equally potent possibilities for your fate, Sagittarius. I hope to God you remember it and write it down.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

The "problem" you now face is unprecedented: You are seeing too clearly, thinking too crisply, and speaking too forthrightly. Normally I would celebrate this state of affairs, but right now it's preventing you from even discovering, let alone taking advantage of the subtle opportunities that life is offering you. These opportunities will only make themselves known if you relax your piercing gaze and invoke what we might call fuzzy logic. You know how at night you can see better if you look out of the corners of your eyes?

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

I've rarely seen astrological aspects so favorable for sublimating your libido in the quest for sublime truth. You will have cosmic law on your side if you attempt to do what a few mystics have claimed to accomplish: fall in love with the Divine Wow. Please note that the right kind of human partner can facilitate this erotic breakthrough; the wrong kind will distract you from it. Now read what the Indian saint Ramakrishna had to say: "Mad! One must become mad with love to realize God. When one attains ecstatic love of God, all the pores of the skin, even the roots of the hair, become like so many sex organs, and in every pore the aspirant enjoys the happiness of communion with the supreme universal self."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You remind me of that rare hybrid known as the puwo, a cross between a poodle and a wolf. When the poodle part of you is dominant, you're nervous, elegant, and beautiful in a fragile way. When the wolf aspect is in control, you're wild, restless, and ferocious in a style that's enigmatic and potentially dangerous. Sometimes, when the two facets are equally balanced, you're an unpredictable X factor: nervous and wild, elegant and restless, fragile and ferocious. How much longer can you sustain this crazy-making drama? I hope and predict you'll finish no later than August 20, since after that you won't be able to get away with it.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Fifty years ago prophets believed we'd all be working no more than 32 hours a week by now. Some predicted we'd have as many as 220 days off a year, devoting just 145 to earning our daily bread. What went wrong? Most of us are putting in more hard labor than our grandparents did. But if you want to be faithful to current astrological mandates, Aries, you will spend the next few weeks doing everything you can to bring your life into closer alignment with the old prophecy. The naked fact of the matter is that you need more playtime.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"You may enjoy this movie if you shut down enough brain cells. I turned off all except the ones needed to remember where I parked my car." This observation comes from a critic's evaluation of the first Charlie's Angels film, but I've read similar comments in many other reviews. Indeed, it's an approach that many intelligent people employ routinely in response to all the loud, shiny garbage our culture foists on us. What about you, Taurus? Do you assume you have to make yourself dumber in order to have fun? Has the blaring inanity of the world caused you to shut down your smart sensitivity? If so, work hard to reverse this trend in the coming week. You'll receive help from unexpected sources if you do.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

You and I and everyone else in the world talk to ourselves constantly. The conversation is mostly silent and covert, however. As a result, we get away with abusing ourselves; we assail ourselves with mean thoughts that we'd be far less likely to fling if we actually spoke them aloud. The astrological omens suggest that now is a perfect time for you to break this bad habit. In fact, I'm going to officially declare that it's Speak More Kindly to Yourself Week. For best results, shun the usual telepathic communion with yourself. Instead, say every word aloud as you carry on your dialogues. (P.S. You may want to consult the book What to Say When You Talk to Yourself, by Shad Helmstetter.)

"Dear Rob: In a recent column, I think you mentioned a book that dealt with making everyday tasks more spiritual. I'm gung-ho to do exactly that: give thanks before I eat, wake up laughing, bless the ground I walk on, notice with joyful appreciation the divine bounty that overflows in ordinary moments. Can you direct me to the book in question? -Grateful Crab"
	Dear Grateful: You must have dreamed it. Not since I touted Thomas Moore's Care of the Soul in 2000 have I made reference to any such a book. To tell you the truth, though, you don't need authorities to guide you right now. Your intuition will lead you unerringly in your quest to find sacred mojo in the smallest details.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I advise you to avoid ingesting rocket fuel in the coming days. That means you should be careful about eating lettuce grown in Southern California. Much of it contains high levels of perchlorate, a main ingredient of rocket fuel. (The Environmental Working Group says it's because defense contractor Lockheed Martin has been dumping the stuff in the Colorado River.) In any case, Leo, you won't even need metaphorical rocket fuel. Cosmic forces are conspiring to boost your physical energy and mental agility to record levels.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Mata Amritanandamayi is one of India's most beloved gurus. Also known as Amma, she preaches no doctrine but believes all religions lead to the same goal. Her renown has grown largely through the power and quantity of her embraces. She travels from city to city doling out hugs, often more than a thousand a day. Since she launched her mission as a young girl, she claims to have hugged 21 million people. Amma is your role model for the coming week, Virgo. The astrological omens suggest you'll be most likely to thrive if you suspend all your spiritual theories and ideological opinions and become a pure channel for unconditional love. Try to hug at least 20 people. For extra credit, do 40.

George Washington was afflicted with smallpox, malaria, pleurisy, consumption, amoebic dysentery, rotten teeth, and Kleinfelter's syndrome. That didn't stop him from accomplishing feats that earned him a place in the history books. I suggest you make him your patron saint in the coming weeks, Libra. Draw inspiration from his heroic ability to overcome personal discomfort. You're in a prime position to render months of suffering irrelevant with a decisive triumph.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In 1914, the science magazine Nature found that 30 percent of the world's top scientists believed in God. In a second survey in 1934, the number dropped to 15 percent, and by 1998 it was seven percent. From these data, we can speculate that it's getting harder for smart intellectuals to commune with the Divine Wow the way we smart mystics do. That's a damn shame. Luckily for you, though, Scorpio, you're now in an unusual phase in which there's no contradiction between cultivating both rigorous critical thinking and an intimate relationship with the nine-tenths of reality that is hidden from our five senses.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

 The most venerated object in Islam is the Kaaba, a large cube in a mosque in Mecca. Lodged in a corner of the Kaaba is its most sacred part, a black stone surrounded by an oval silver structure. Muslims kiss it at the climax of their pilgrimage to Mecca. Astrologer Caroline Casey points out that this holy of holies has the shape of a vulva, and suggests that it reveals Islam's unconscious yearning for the Goddess. That's ironic for a male-dominated religion, which, like Judaism and Christianity, has suppressed the feminine aspects of the divine. I offer this vignette as a starting point for this week's meditations, Sagittarius. What feminine aspects of the divine do you unconsciously long for and need? How can you bring more of their influence into your life?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Frank O'Hara's poem "Meditations in an Emergency" is mostly a meandering, self-indulgent mess, but it contains three lines that should inspire you for weeks. I suggest you regard them as pithy teachings. Here they are. 1. "Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous." 2. "I am the least difficult of men. All I want is boundless love." 3. "It is easy to be beautiful; it is difficult to appear so." By the way, Capricorn, O'Hara's poem is a microcosm of your immediate future, when small but valuable treasures will be embedded in heaps of useless nonsense.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Last year Nigerian women launched a new form of protest against the U.S.-owned oil company that wreaked environmental havoc in their country: They threatened to get naked in public. During the invasion of Iraq, several groups of American women, inspired by the Nigerians, registered their dissent through mass nudity. More recently, Mexican farmers stripped to their underpants during a demonstration against their government's policies. From an astrological perspective, it's a perfect time for you Aquarians to further develop this new tradition. Take off your clothes to those you oppose! Or if that's too extreme, try the metaphorical equivalent: Disarm your adversaries not by attacking them but by expressing your vulnerability.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Every Thursday night I roll my trashcan to the curb so that the sanitation engineers can pick it up next morning. Usually it's three-quarters full of garbage bags and requires no special treatment. But on some weeks I generate more than my normal share of refuse. To fit it in, I have to become a human trash compactor. I grab a low-slung branch from the persimmon tree, pull myself up, and lower myself down inside the trashcan, jumping up and down to compress the load and make room for more. I hope I can serve as an inspiration for you this week, Pisces. By my astrological reckoning, you should gather, compress, and throw away at least six months' worth of outworn junk, including both the psychic and physical varieties. 

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Pisces. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

This horoscope is  a collaboration between me and Rumi, a Sufi poet who died 730 years ago. "All disquiet springs from a search for quiet," Rumi would like you to know. "And so the best way to cultivate inner peace," I add, "is to learn to love the way everything keeps changing." Rumi continues: "All illnesses spring from scavenging for delicacies." I conclude: "So pluck the simple, inexpensive riches that are right in front of you."

A long-distance runner I know prepares for his competitions in a way that seems counterintuitive. For his next race, a 38-mile marathon in August, he has been running five miles a day four times a week. He will never actually practice a 38-mile jaunt in one stretch. This approach has never failed him in preparing for previous races. Like him, Taurus, you will soon be called on to pull off a marathon version of a task you've been doing on a smaller scale. By my astrological reckoning, you'll have all the stamina and savvy you need to succeed.

Decide what mental pictures you're sick and tired of looking at, then banish them from the sacred temple of your imagination. Next, browse the fertile depths of your subconscious mind, searching for exciting new mental pictures that you want to install in your awareness full time. For instance, you might want to exorcise a certain fearful scenario that pops up whenever you're under stress, and replace it with a bright, shiny vision of you at the top of your game.

Many fantastic beasts that are known to Harry Potter and his fellow wizards are invisible to Muggles, the ordinary people. They include the yeti, also know as bigfoot; the clabbert, a tree-dwelling animal that's a cross between a monkey and a frog; and the phoenix, a bird that periodically bursts into flames, dies, then resurrects itself from its ashes. But my favorite magical creature is the billywig, a mosquito-like insect whose sting causes its victims to become giddy and levitate off the ground. Even if you're a Muggle, I predict you will have an experience that resembles a billywig bite in the coming week. An annoying prick will lead to a pleasant floating sensation.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

The force of gravity can't be seen, heard, or touched, and almost no one can explain it. There wasn't even a word for it until the seventeenth century, when Isaac Newton identified it and gave it a name, borrowing the Latin term gravitas, meaning "heaviness" or "seriousness." I predict that you'll enjoy a similar breakthrough in the next month, Leo. You will finally recognize an essential energy or power or beauty that has forever been a secret to you, even though it has always been all around you.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Largely because of humans, animal and plant species are dying off at a record rate. The earth is in the midst of the greatest mass extinction since the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. If the trend continues, a quarter of the mammals will be gone in 30 years, and half of all species will be exterminated by 2100. Most people aren't consciously aware of the ongoing annihilation, yet we all feel it in our bones and know it in our souls. As a result, we carry a huge load of unacknowledged grief. If you wonder why you sometimes feel down or anxious even though your life is going well, this secret tragedy may be the cause. Now is an excellent time to tune in to the sadness, Virgo, and recognize that it's not caused by your personal failure.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

The legislatures of most American states have devoted a lot of time to choosing their power symbols. Pennsylvania, for instance, has made the chocolate chip cookie its Official State Cookie. The bola tie is the Official State Neckwear of Arizona; the morel is the Official State Mushroom of Minnesota; the Tule duck decoy is the Official Artifact of Nevada; and "Red or green?" is the official state question of New Mexico. According to my astrological analysis, Libra, you're in a phase when you should make similar designations for your own personal empire. What is your official cookie, neckwear, mushroom, artifact, and question? Don't stop there. Add at least 20 more categories.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In a study of modern democracy, a British political scientist has concluded that lying is necessary and justifiable. ¬ìPolitics should be regarded as less like an exercise in producing truthful statements and more like a poker game,¬î said Glen Newey. ¬ìAnd there is an expectation by a poker player that you try to deceive them as part of the game.¬î Personally, I find this attitude distasteful. My policy is to never be dishonest if I can help it. But then I have the luxury to live like that. As a self-employed poet, I don't have to hash out compromises with ideological adversaries or hang out in moral gray areas in order to serve a greater good. But your path may be different, Scorpio. In August, you might have to lie a little as you fight for a noble cause.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

I've tried a wide variety of meditative practices from many traditions. I've calmed myself through rhythmic breathing; watched bemusedly as the nonstop cavalcade of images paraded across my mind; visualized sacred mandalas and cultivated unconditional love; taken rigorous inventories to determine whether the integrity of my actions matches my high ideals. And that's just a few. But in 25 years, I've never heard of a meditation that asks me to go into a public place, take my attention completely off myself, and observe people with precise and compassionate objectivity. Luckily, you're in a perfect phase to pioneer this radical new mode. It'll energize you enormously.

My friend Jane Heaven is an uncanny catalyst. Good things happen for me when she's around; interesting connections and fun challenges pop up. Why? It has to do with her curiosity and willingness to try new things. One night on her radio talk show on KPFA, she goaded me and five other guests not to speak but rather to sing everything we wanted to communicate. For the next two hours we improvised a cappella melodies and rhythms as we carried on our meandering discourse. I came away inspired to write two new songs, which I produced the next day. Now listen to this, Capricorn: Your own personal equivalent of Jane Heaven is either already in your life, waiting for you to ask for more direct help, or else is hovering close by, ready to be summoned.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Capricorn. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

On a Star Trek rerun, a female starship captain 370 years in the future was considering a love affair with a nineteenth-century Irish bartender -- or rather a hologram of the bartender in a realistic holographic recreation of an Irish village. Though she felt an attraction, she wished several things about the man were different. Since she literally had the power to reprogram him, she did, creating an even more desirable character. But after their fling she felt remorse and sought advice from the ship's non-human doctor. "I've noticed you humans often try to change those you fall in love with," the doc noted. "Why is that?" Let this serve as a teaching story for you, Aquarius. You may feel like redesigning people you love in the coming weeks, but I suggest you change yourself instead.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Songbirds are disappearing all over the world, in part due to deforestation. If current trends continue, the tunes of Yellow-throated Warblers and Red-eyed Vireos, along with many others, will be gone forever. Meanwhile, crows, starlings, and blue jays are enjoying a population explosion. You'll be hearing a lot more of their shrieks in the coming years. While you may not be able to do anything to prevent this, Pisces, being aware of it could help you avoid an analogous development in your personal life. In August, encourage your inner bird -- the part of you that loves to take flight -- to be melodious rather than shrill.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

For last year's Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert, artist David Best constructed the Temple of Joy. Made from recycled wooden pieces of dinosaur puzzles, this magnificent pagoda-like sanctuary took him weeks to perfect. Pilgrims who visited it were encouraged to write blessings and prayers on the walls as they meditated. At the end of the festival, Best burned his masterpiece to the ground. According to my reading of the astrological omens, you Aries should model your own process after his in the coming weeks. In other words, create sacred and beautiful magic out of whimsical stuff, use it for a while to achieve a sweet catharsis, then leave it behind.

No one knows you better than you do, Aries. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

I don't see physical danger in your immediate future, Taurus, but you may be exposed to higher levels of psychic toxins than usual. Therefore, I suggest that you erect a protective barrier to shield yourself. Visualize a force field of violet light surrounding you everywhere you go. To add a touch of humor -- which will dramatically bolster your defenses, by the way -- imagine that the force field is augmented by rainbow-colored barbed wire, boomerang-wielding amazon warriors, and a gang of wisecracking dragons.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I have a miracle to report. A large HMO in Northern California is now offering homeopathic treatment at one of its clinics. Most American doctors still regard this system of medicine as a kooky New Age craze, on a par with acupuncture and reiki, but here it has officially become a mainstream treatment. Who pulled off this feat? A versatile Gemini friend. For years he has been split, working as an M.D. for the HMO and maintaining a private homeopathic practice. But recently he lobbied the HMO's administrators to let him practice both skills, and they agreed. I suggest you make him your role model, Gemini. Like him, you're primed to create a role that'll blend talents you've always had to keep unconnected. Will you change the course of history, too?

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Gemini. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

The recently released "World Wealth Report" came to a sad conclusion: The global supply of millionaires was up only 2.1 percent in 2002, the slowest rate increase in seven years. On a happier note -- at least as far as we Cancers are concerned -- my sources say that a disproportionate number of the new moneybags were born under the sign of the Crab. The trend of increasing wealth among our tribe has continued in 2003, but will soon peak. During these last few weeks of abundant financial luck, I suggest you intensify your efforts to cash in.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Begone blame! Atonement and absolution must reign! Yes, Leo, this is the best time in many moons to declare amnesty. Forgive everyone who has ever hurt you. Purge yourself of simmering resentments and remorse. Swear off revenge forever, including both vindictive acts and nasty thoughts. It's especially important that you let go of the guilt you've felt about your own failures. Remember when you were "it" while playing hide-and-seek as a child? Remember yelling out "ollie ollie in free" or "ollie ollie oxen free"? Let that be your mantra this week. It means "all who are out can come in free."

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Two weeks ago I said the hawk will be your animal ally for the foreseeable future. This week I decided to seek contact with an actual hawk, hoping it might provide an omen about your evolving destiny. I hiked into the wilds and made myself comfortable, meditating on the question, "Is there a hawk out there with an oracle for Virgo?" After about an hour a red-tailed hawk began circling above. I uttered a series of mysterious sounds, and the bird drew near. I made myself alert to every nuance of its behavior, receptive for a sign. Then it swooped down so close I could look it in the eyes. At that moment, it pooped. The oracle had been delivered: You, Virgo, have entered a phase when your power will come from purifying yourself of waste.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Tibetan Buddhist teacher Geshe Chekawa (1220-1295) specialized in bodhicitta, seeking enlightenment not for personal gain but as a way to serve others. On his death bed, he prayed to be sent to hell so that he might alleviate the suffering of the lost souls there. I'd like to contrast his life's work with your next assignment, Libra. Like Chekawa, you'll have an enormous capacity to help and inspire people. Unlike him, the best way to fulfill this potential is not to practice self-denial. Just the opposite, in fact: Be as radiant, expressive, and as full of delight as you dare.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

"Sometimes an orgasm is better than being onstage," says Mick Jagger. "Sometimes being onstage is better than an orgasm." I'm betting there'll be no need to choose between these two forms of satisfaction in the coming weeks, Scorpio. They should both be readily available and supremely pleasurable. Your version of being "onstage" won't be like Jagger's, of course. But it should afford you an equally fine chance to show off your animal magnetism and imprint receptive minds with your bright ideas.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"Humor is emotional chaos remembered in tranquility," said writer James Thurber. If he's right, your immediate future should be full of humor. You have finally wriggled your way out of the holy mess that was numbing your laugh reflex. You have mastered the tumultuous lessons that nearly scrambled your brains. Let the festival of peace and quiet begin! May you enjoy great convulsions of amusement as you joke about your close calls.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Nike will pay high school basketball sensation LeBron James $90 million to endorse its shoes for the next seven years. The company is betting that the young phenom, born December 30, 1984, will live up to his hype when he begins playing with the pros in a few months. It's not unheard-of for a Capricorn to ripen into his full potential early on, but what's more common is a long, slow build. Look at you: You're still working to reach maturity in your chosen field. The good news is that once you finally do come of age, you'll stay in bloom long after other people of your generation begin to wither. Here's some more good news: You're in a phase when you can ripen a lot in a short time.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Mark Seltman is a palm-reader whose approach to his art is similar to my relationship with astrology. If he sees a character flaw indicated by a line on your palm, he won't make you feel like it's a curse you're powerless to resist; instead, he'll tell you what you can do to fix it or overcome it. An article about him on www.newyorkmetro.com described how his daughter was born with a hand that suggested she'd suffer from low self-esteem when she grew up. In response, Seltman dedicated himself to building her confidence and competence. Now, years later, the warning sign in her hand at birth has disappeared; she's brimming with aplomb. Let this story inspire you, Aquarius. Tune in to a weakness or foible in your own make-up, and develop a long-term plan to triumph over it.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I was at a meeting of people planning to attend the Burning Man festival this August. During a break, my friend Johann did a demo of the laser light show he plans to unveil there. As dazzling emerald beams of light danced above our heads, someone said, "None of that impressive display would be visible if it weren't for the dust and particles in the air." "Yeah," Johann agreed, "you can't see lasers in a vacuum. They need to have something to reflect off. Flakes of our dead skin are essential to revealing the beauty." This will be your metaphor of power in the coming week, Pisces. I hope it will help you find meaning and blessings in the residues of things that have passed away.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I hope you decided against participating in that weird contest -- you know, the one in which you would have competed to see who could bang their head against the wall the most times before passing out. I trust you also turned down any invitations you got to show off your amazing wounds or prove how attractive your problems are. Continue to show a similar forbearance in the coming week, Aries. The worst is over. The pressure to express yourself perversely will soon diminish as the very hassles that have been frustrating you will morph into elegant opportunities.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Karvina, a town in the Czech Republic, has passed a law making it illegal to grow weeds. Offenders can be forced to pay a hefty fine if the Weeds Commission finds, say, a thistle flourishing amidst the potato plants. I'm tempted to enforce an equally stringent requirement on you Tauruses, at least for the next two weeks. For your own long-term good, as well as everyone else's, you cannot afford to be lax towards interlopers, whether they're actual or metaphorical weeds. Maintain the highest standards, please. Commit yourself with passionate integrity to incorruptible purity.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

You should be seriously considered for employee of the month. I love how you've been brightening up the workplace with your bursts of imaginative flair. If your associates have not yet registered the fact that your already-considerable value has risen even further, I urge you to show them this horoscope. In another matter, I'm certain that you should also be named shopper of the month. On the one hand you've been healing an obsessive glitch in your consumer habits, while on the other hand you've been delightfully intuitive about which purchases will improve your life in the most lasting ways.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In a scene on the HBO TV show "Six Feet Under," George told Ruth about a house he'd owned in New England. Built over a stream, it had originally been a mill, though the wheel and grinding stones had been removed decades before. After he'd lived there for a while, George decided to put a new floor in the kitchen. He ripped out the old surface, then tore up the first wooden plank of the foundation below. There, just two feet below him, was the stream -- alive, sparkling, thrilling. He had known about it all along, but at that moment he actually saw it flowing beneath his house. I predict you will have a similar breakthrough in the coming week, Cancer. You will commune intimately with a source of magic you have had only indirect or imaginative contact with.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

When many people I know talk about their childhoods, they emphasize the alienating, traumatic experiences they suffered. Few report vivid memories of the good times. This has always felt dishonest to me; I attribute it to the cynical tenor of our age rather than the objective truth. In saying that, I don't mean to downplay the way our early encounters with pain demoralized our spirits. But you, Leo, are in a phase when it's crucial for you to acknowledge and honor the gifts you were given in your early years: all the joyful encounters, wise teachings, and blessings that helped you bloom.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I predict you will be in a hearty, even triumphant mood in the coming week, Virgo. There'll be few if any loose ends. Unfinished business will either complete itself or else reveal to you how to wrap it up simply and quickly. However, even if you have to pass through a moment or two of dark doubt, it's essential that you stay committed to your mood of hearty triumph. Please write down this poem from Tony Hoagland and carry it around in your wallet: "No matter how you feel, you have to act like you are very popular with yourself; very relaxed and purposeful, very unconfused and not like you are walking through the sunshine singing in chains."

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Black South Africans fought for more than 40 years to dismantle the oppressive system of apartheid. One of their most potent weapons was toyi-toyi, a militantly exuberant form of singing and dancing. It mobilized the energy of crowds at the large protest demonstrations that ultimately broke the will of the white minority rulers. Imagine how confounded their authoritarian minds must have been when confronted by thousands of high-spirited people singing and dancing in unison. I wish you were uninhibited enough to lead a celebratory form of uprising like toyi-toyi, Libra. There's a status quo you're part of that desperately needs a friendly shock of that caliber. Can you maybe think of something a little less outrageous but equally fun, rebellious, and effective?

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

If you're a songwriter, it's a good time to make yourself a Jennifer Lopez sock puppet, install it on your left hand, and ask it to help you create a tune that will sell a million copies. If you're a painter, it's a perfect moment to channel the spirit of Pablo Picasso as you dash off a few dozen masterworks, and if you're a writer, you should pretend you're the reincarnation of F. Scott Fitzgerald and whip out a future bestseller. In short, Scorpio, I recommend that you imitate people who have been successful in the way that you want to be. If necessary, get a new hero who inspires you to even greater heights than your old familiar heroes.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, and breeds reptiles of the mind," said visionary poet William Blake. There's not a person alive who can ignore that counsel, in my opinion; in various degrees, we all suffer from the mental illness of dogmatism. Luckily for you, Sagittarius, it's a perfect moment to flush out the standing water in your own psyche. You will attract unexpected help whenever you seek information that might shake up your staunch theories and beliefs about the way the world works.

"You do not truly know someone until you fight them." That's one of my favorite lines in the film "The Matrix Reloaded." The oracle's bodyguard, Seraph, says this to the hero, Neo, after starting a brouhaha with him. It seems Seraph doesn't necessarily want to kick Neo's ass, but rather find out more about him so as to determine whether he can be trusted to consult with the oracle. Take this wisdom to heart, Capricorn. I suspect you'll have some interesting conflicts in the coming weeks. Their purpose is to bring you closer to the people you'll struggle with, not drive you apart.

Everyone has an allergy, either physical or psychic. Mine is to cats. My colleague Sophie's is to peanuts. My friend Jason's is to his family of origin. (He starts sneezing if he merely sees a photo of his brothers and sisters.) I have an acquaintance, Justine, who swears she's allergic to environments that are too clean and orderly. Your allergy, Aquarius, might be to something concrete like tree pollen or dairy products, or it might be more mysterious, like Jason's or Justine's. Whatever it is, you should redefine your relationship with it in the next two weeks. Believe it or not, you can reduce its power to make you sick.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

To prepare for your week, listen to this tale of role reversal. It stars a beautiful flower as the villain and a grubby little insect as the hero. It's taking place all over Africa right now, where the water hyacinth has been choking rivers and lakes with its rapacious growth. A non-native species brought from Brazil a century ago, the hyacinth has had no impediments to its out-of-control spread until recently. Then a scientist found weevils that eat nothing but hyacinths, and sicced them on the out-of-control flower. His strategy is already working. The moral of the story, Pisces, as far as you¬íre concerned: If you're threatened with getting way too much of a good thing, enlist an unlikely ally to assist you.

No one knows you better than you do, Pisces. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Baseball players sometimes use the term "winning ugly." It refers to a game in which they've managed to emerge victorious even though they've made mistakes and performed below their potential. I predict you will soon have occasion to invoke this phrase to describe your own version of an unaesthetic triumph. There's another term I want to arm you with: "ugly ripe." Technically, it's the name of a delicious heirloom tomato whose irregular, bulbous shape sets it apart from the smooth, bland varieties that fill the tomato sections of most grocery stores. In the coming week, it will also apply to the peculiar but juicy quality of your life.

I predict that in the next seven days you will receive exactly 22 email advertisements offering to increase your penis size and 22 email ads to increase your breast size. Although you may be inclined to dismiss this as a boring inconvenience, I believe it will be an excellent cosmic omen that confirms what the astrological configurations reveal: a sign that you're primed to express both masculine and feminine qualities in a more intense and yet balanced way. I suppose this possibility may repulse you if you identify yourself as a macho male or a girlie girl. But for most of you, capitalizing on this opportunity will make you smarter and sexier.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Philosopher Jean Houston likes to quote a Native American saying that's important for you to hear right now: "When we take one step towards the gods, the gods take ten steps towards us." Here's another way to think about it: There are huge cosmic intelligences whose work is imperceptible to our five senses. They aren't figments of the imagination or sentimental fictions, but actual beings. When we acknowledge their existence and ask for their help, they enjoy responding. More than that: They love to collaborate with our strong intentions.

Here's the homework I gave my readers two months ago: "Guess what age you'll be when you finally know exactly who you are." In response, a Cancerian woman named Bridjet wrote this: "I hope I NEVER completely know who I am! I love discovering new mysteries about myself; I love to change as everything else around me changes. It's one of the most beautifully thrilling things about life -- that the only constant is change. If I ever know completely who I am, it'll be a sad day -- because it will mean that I haven't changed in a long time, that I've become stagnant." Bridjet's buoyant words should serve as your inspiration, Cancerian. You're already the zodiac's most frequent and expert changer, and these days you're primed to mutate even more than usual.

In his only book, the French poet Lautr√©amont (1846-1870) wrote about holy yearning disguised as mournful complaint. "Whenever you hear the dogs' howling in the fields," his mother told him as a child, "don't deride what they do: they thirst insatiably for the infinite, like you, me, and the rest of us humans. I even allow you to stand at the window and gaze upon this exalted spectacle." Let this passage be the starting point for your meditations in the coming week, Leo. You need to search for the noble purpose that lies beneath the plaintive cries that have been racking your heart.

In a horoscope I wrote for you in June of 2000, I reported that for the first time ever, your power animal was a hawk. "Act more like predator than prey for a change," I advised. Now, three years later, you're ready to reprise your hawk imitation, but with even more flair. I hereby authorize you to travel far and wide in search of the delectable nourishment that excites you most. Remember how your inexperience kept you from harvesting the full benefits of your hawkness three years ago? You know better now.

What makes a song popular? A charismatic singer, high-tech production, and millions of dollars' worth of marketing? In the modern world, yes, but not in other times and places. In his article "Rhythm, Myth and Spirit," David Pulak notes that among the Zu√±i Indian tribe, music "is judged by how well it resonates with the experiences of the community." In other words, a good song articulates everyone's unconscious feelings and unverbalized beliefs, thereby creating group solidarity. Your assignment in the coming weeks, Libra, is to use everything -- music, ritual, constructive gossip, parties, pep talks, or whatever works -- to do for your tribe what music does for the Zu√±i.

"Dear Dr. Brezsny: Reading your 'scopes lately has felt like finding a roll of hundred dollar bills in a heap of moldy sour cream in a garbage can; like getting a great massage from a cute underwear model in a velvet sanctuary while some jerk with a chainsaw prunes trees outside. How about serving up less paradoxical advice? I'd almost prefer getting a purely bad prediction to this maddening ambiguous stuff you've been serving up. -Scorpio Goddess" 
	Dear Goddess: I'm just reporting the facts, ma'am. You yourself have been like a sleek athlete trying to do what you do best while stuffing your face with doughnuts . . . like a brilliant scholar struggling to read your books in a mirror with one eye closed . . . like a spontaneous kid hoping to convince a humorless octogenarian to play tag.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Jeanine, a Sagittarius woman I know, likes to compare her lovers to food. Recently she gave me a dissertation on her romantic history. "When I was 21," she said, "I had two guys. One was a pepperoni pizza-type. He was too spicy to enjoy more than once a week. The other guy was like oatmeal, bland and filling. I didn't get tired of him, though on the other hand he wasn't too exciting. Now that I'm 37, my tastes have ripened. I'm not much interested in oatmeal men any more. I could have pepperoni pizza every day." I believe Jeanine's evolution parallels a transition you're going through, Sagittarius. You don't have as much time as you used to for the bland, filling stuff. You need intense flavors more frequently. This applies to every part of you, not just your love life.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Every now and then, you need to get exactly what you want; it is the duty of the cosmos to bring you the thing you have specifically asked for. This is not, however, one of those times. Rather, you're in an astrological phase when it is important for you to give someone you care for exactly what he or she wants; it's your duty to bring that person something he or she has specifically asked for. So choose a deserving soul for whom you will be an angel of perfect generosity.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

During the next three weeks, it's crucial that you laugh more while you're working and chortle more while you're driving and giggle more while you're paying bills. In mysterious ways that would take me thousands of words to describe in full, the proper evolution of your long-term dreams requires you to have clownish epiphanies in situations where you've been way too serious. It'll also be important for the mental health of those you care about. In other words, Aquarius, playful abandon will not merely be a pleasant diversion but an essential medicine.

In accordance with the astrological omens, Pisces, I invite you to take on an additional job title in the week ahead: beautifier. If you agree to carry out the duties of this role, you will incite gorgeous fun and lyrical mystery everywhere you go. How? Bring scintillating harmony and mischievous grace into your conversations. Sneak a Chagall print onto an unadorned wall. Break into whimsical songs, dispense outrageous praise, ask crafty questions that provoke original thoughts, and point out all the institutions and relationships that are working really well. (P.S. You won't believe how many selfish benefits will come your way if you do this.)

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The United States often leads the way in dreaming up novel gourmet treats, but China is now marketing an amazing product that American food designers haven't even begun to develop: milk beer. Appealing to both the infantile longing for creamy liquid nourishment and the adult craving for inhibition-loosening alcohol, it's bound to become the 21st century's first new staple. From an astrological perspective, Aries, the time is ripe for you to gorge yourself with a blend like milk beer. If it's not yet being sold in your area, I suggest you mix up your own batch.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"Dear Mr. Brezsny: Your horoscopes are useless. Most of them are full of philosophical crap that has nothing to do with my daily life. Enough with the metaphors already! Just tell me if there's love or money or trouble in my future -- stuff that normal horoscopes say! -Testy Taurus."
	Dear Testy: I predict that in the coming week, you and your fellow Bulls will have close encounters with the kind of experience you just directed at me. In other words, people will try to get you to be something other than what you are. Do not, under any circumstances, cave into them.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Taurus? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Gemini performer Keith Hennessy teaches classes in improvisation. I'll quote his ideas about the subject because they perfectly describe the nature of the spirit you should invoke in the coming weeks. Here's his definition of improvisation. "The art of being in full awareness and integrity right now. The opposite of repression. The closest we get to the source language of creativity, soul, play, and magic. A crazy attempt to align body and mind not only in the pursuit of freedom, but in the actual experience of freedom. Intentional spontaneity. The beauty and truth of the wild."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

To quote an old song, Cancerian, your future lies beyond the yellow brick road. In other words, it's time to let go of the fairy-tale vision of success that fueled you when you were young and naive. A more mature dream is calling, inviting you to get older and wiser fast. Initially, this replacement may feel like a loss, but ultimately it will awaken passions and ingenuity that the original goal would never have coaxed out. Ironically, it will also lead you to rewards that the yellow brick road promised but never could have delivered.

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Cancerian? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Dragon alert! You have a date with an influence that has a metaphorical resemblance to a scaly, winged, fire-breathing beast. As daunting as that may sound, you shouldn't avoid it; I believe it will actually help your soul grow bigger and stronger. On the other hand, there's no need to immediately race over to the dragon's cave and poke it with a stick. Try to arrange a meeting that takes place on your home turf and in the presence of your allies.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Leo? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

A fundamentalist is anyone who thinks his belief system trumps all others. Religious fanatics are the most obvious example, but scientists can be fundamentalists. So can socialists or capitalists, environmentalists or atheists. Every fundamentalist divides the world into two camps, those who agree with him and those who don't. To him, there is one right way and a million wrong ways to interpret reality. Now here's the uncomfortable news: Every one of us has the fundamentalist virus. It may not be as virulent in you and me as it is in the bad guys we love to hate. But we're all infected. Luckily, Virgo, you're in an astrological phase when you can achieve a partial cure. To begin, take everything less seriously and less personally and less literally.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

My acquaintance John traveled to Antarctica. On the first day, the guide took him and his group to a remote area and left them alone for an hour to commune with the pristine air and unearthly stillness. After a while, a penguin ambled up and launched into a ceremonial display of squawks and stretches. John responded with recitals of his favorite memorized poems, imagining he was "engaged in a conversation with eternity." Then the penguin sent a stream of green projectile vomit cascading against his chest, and shuffled away. Though John initially felt deflated by eternity's surprise, no harm was done. Later he came to see it as a first-class cosmic joke, and treasured its value as an amusing story with which to regale his friends back home. I predict you will have an analogous experience in the coming week, Libra.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

You're like an arrow in flight, Scorpio. You're a half-cooked feast, the fifth month of pregnancy, the week before a big election. When I turned my psychic vision towards you just now, I saw an image of a worker bee freshly returned to the hive to perform the dance that will tell its companions where to find a patch of blooming snapdragons. Have you ever mastered a second language? Where you are at this moment resembles the time right before you attain fluency.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

When I relocated from Santa Cruz to Marin County in 1991, I moved from a hotbed of alternative lifestyles to a very wealthy community. In making the transition, I knew I'd have to deal with a character flaw: my prejudice against rich white people. Over the years, I've made great progress in dissolving my bigotry, but today I was sorely tested. While walking downtown, I spied a Lexus SC-430 with a vanity license plate that read "PUREHRT." Indignation surged through me as I thought, "It's inconceivable that the owner of a $60,000 sports car could have a pure heart!" But soon my compassionate mind kicked in, and I opened to the possibility, quieting my judgmental reflex. Let this tale serve as your inspiration this week, Sagittarius. It's time to have a showdown with your deepest prejudice.

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

At last year's Burning Man, the week-long festival of cheerful mischief in the Nevada desert, a character calling himself Mother Very Superior was omnipresent. Clad in a nun's habit and black leather chastity belt, he roamed far and wide, dispensing blessings with a toy cat-o'-nine-tails. "I hereby absolve you of your sins," he chanted as he softly whipped anyone who consented to his gift, "so now you are free to go ahead and sin like crazy." I suggest you find someone to do you a similar favor, Capricorn. To take maximum advantage of the explosive fun that will be available in the near future, you should get your karmic debt down as close as possible to zero.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Being right doesn't guarantee success in the coming week. Nor does being strong or smart or rich or well-connected. No, Aquarius, none of the usual assets will be of much use if you want to triumph over adversity. There is another way, though. It would require you to be tricky yet ethical. You'd have to be good in a sneaky way, or pull off some subterfuge while aflame with a noble purpose. Here's another tip for ensuring victory: Renounce any attachment you have to getting full credit for your heroic efforts.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Everyone needs music, but you, Pisces, can't survive without it. Your moist, hungry, undulating soul tends to devolve into confusion without regular exposure to music's wild intelligence. It's also important for you to keep finding fresh songs to commune with. Depending solely on those that moved you once upon a time encourages you to commit a sin your tribe has to be wary of: living in the past. As for what music would nourish you best right now, I'll trust your intuition to guide you. But here's some soul food for thought from the song "Green Light: Now Begin," by hip-hop group Blackalicious: "No more of that sittin' in a slump/ No more of that coulda-woulda-shoulda junk/ No more of that waiting for the inspiration, innovation/ It's time to expand, power from within, you're takin' over this dominion/ Green light, now begin."

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

The dictator of Turkmenistan, Saparmurad Niyazov, has had streets, farms, children, a brand of vodka, and oil pipelines named after him. Recently he branched out, deciding to change the name of the year 2003 to that of his dead mother, Gurbansoltan, "to immortalize her sacred image and blessed memory." While I'm not in a position to argue about the farms and liquor, I disagree with his latest revision. In fact, I hereby move to re-christen the year Gurbansoltan/2003. Forevermore, let it be known as "Aries," to honor the sublime ripening your tribe's self-expressiveness has enjoyed these past months -- and that will continue through August.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

"The world is composed of rival gangs of hypnotists, each competing for your entranced attention." I found this scrawled on the wall of a public restroom. It's not literally true, of course, but it might as well be. Every day you're besieged by advertisers, entertainers, politicians, and news media that would love you to adopt their views. To resist their brainwashing, you have to exert heroic efforts to think for yourself. In the coming weeks, your vigilance must be even more rigorous than usual. Here are some tips: Be the opposite of a know-it-all. Make curiosity and open-mindedness your highest values. Read and listen to people who don't believe what you do. Consider the possibility that your opinions may be wrong or incomplete.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

The first thing they tell you when you enter law school is that there is no justice. The cruel truth is that every legal process is tainted with favoritism and prejudice. In this realm where objectivity is supposedly the supreme value, subjectivity is rampant. The outcome of judicial decisions may hinge as much on human error and the unruly power of the imagination as on the naked facts. Once you accept all that as a given, then and only then will you have the potential to become a potent force for fairness and impartiality. While you're probably not starting law school right now, Gemini, similar principles will apply to the challenges you'll face in the coming weeks.

No one knows you better than you do, Gemini. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

"It is impossible for man to look straight at the present," noted media prophet Marshall McLuhan, "because he is too terrified by it. We stand on the stern of the ship looking at the wake and saying, 'We're in very troubled waters.'" I'm presenting you with McLuhan's theory, my fellow Cancerian, because you are now poised to refute it. It's true that lately you've been fixated on turmoil unleashed in the past; it's as if you've been peering out of a portal in a tiny room at the back of a fine yacht and moaning, "Everything feels cramped and I'm in troubled waters." But I predict that any minute now you will leave your cramped quarters, bound upstairs, and stride to the front of the ship.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

A 6.7 earthquake rippled through the northwestern United States recently. No one felt it, though, because it happened in slow motion, unfolding gradually over a two-month period. Are you ready for the metaphorical equivalent of this temblor? It will subliminally shake your foundations until your birthday. Whether it ultimately relieves or aggravates deep-seated tensions will depend on your attitude. If you regard it with fear and resistance, it will amplify your existing level of stress. But if you vow to enjoy the ride, it will rock your world in the best possible way.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Leo. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Music by Eminem can pump up a listener's audacity. Because its wicked beats and hysterically ferocious sentiments raise testosterone levels in both men and women, songs from his CD "8 Mile" may also increase ambition, boost pride, and encourage forceful self-expression. You would greatly benefit from this kind of arousal in the coming week, Virgo. Your fervent assertiveness will be crucial to the well-being of both you and your cohorts. I suggest, then, that you cue up "8 Mile," slip on the headphones, and crank up the volume. To accomplish the same result with the help of more elegant forms of masculine power, listen to the speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr. or read Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Love is more than a warm, tender feeling in your heart or loins. When done right, it's a revolutionary mode of perception that naturally moves you to rebel against everything you've been taught about how the world works. It's a radical act of magic that transforms all that it touches. You are, of course, always free to practice a tamer, safer version of love. But if you want to grow up to be a fascinating sex god or goddess, you should devote yourself to the more ultimate form. Now is a perfect time to redouble your commitment to doing just that. The fates are conspiring to help you.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

I'm at a loss to understand why Juneteenth isn't one of America's major holidays. Observed every June 19, it celebrates the emancipation of African-American slaves in the 1860s. Shouldn't it be a time of rejoicing for every race? When one group of people is held in bondage, the lives of all others are distorted. The same is true about the community of sub-personalities that resides within you. When one aspect of your multifaceted psyche is weak and oppressed, the rest suffer, too -- even the supposedly healthy sides of you. I bring this up, Scorpio, because the astrological omens say your own liberation day is nigh. It's time to free every part of you that is in chains.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

One of the most common obstructions to a healthy intimate relationship is what I call the delusion of clairvoyance. Like most of us, you've probably indulged in your share of it: You imagine, perhaps unconsciously, that your partner or friend is somehow magically psychic when it comes to you -- so much so that he or she should unfailingly intuit exactly what you need, even if you don't ask for it. This fantasy may seem romantic, but it can single-handedly sink the most promising alliances. You must avoid feeding it even a little in the coming weeks, Sagittarius. Your intimate life is overdue for a dose of tenderly frank communication.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

These days you remind me of the 65-year-old woman in India who gave birth to her first child; you're like my friend John, who never touched a musical instrument until he was 37 but made himself into a top-flight guitarist by the time he was 45. In other words, Capricorn, you're primed to risk learning a lesson you feared you were too old for. You're ready to set out toward an accomplishment you've thought was off-limits to you forever.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

According to my reading of the astrological omens, you will soon encounter a big, fat obstruction to your creativity. While that may be demoralizing at first, it's actually a good omen. It means that a previously hidden problem is revealing itself; that an inner saboteur is no longer working in secret. It means you'll finally get a chance to fix an energy drain you didn't even know about. As a clue to help you in your noble struggle, Aquarius, I give you the words of novelist Joyce Carol Oates: "Writer's block is the temporary paralysis caused by the conviction, on an unconscious level, that what the writer is attempting is in some way fraudulent, or mistaken, or self-destructive."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The fictional young English wizard Harry Potter can communicate with snakes because he knows their language, Parseltongue. The real English magician John Dee (1527-1609), who served as astrological advisor to Queen Elizabeth, was able to converse with angels in their native language of Enochian. And now, you, Pisces, are about to undergo a four-week intensive course in the language of love, which may include lessons in both Parseltongue and Enochian. By July 20, I expect you'll be close to fluent in several new romantic dialects and an exotic variety of pillow talk.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"People demand freedom of speech," said Norwegian philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, "as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they never use." I hope this smart-ass witticism gets you agitated, Aries. I hope it prods you to wonder whether maybe you sometimes let your mouth race ahead of your brain; whether maybe you're not as free from conventional wisdom as you imagine. Your energetic courage has propelled you halfway up the mountain; to get to the top you'll have to become more skilled at questioning your own assumptions.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Visualize your greatest fear. How much of it is based on a possibility that the dreaded experience could actually happen? What part of your foreboding, on the other hand, is fueled by your active imagination, your habitual propensity to worry, and the pervasive angst the media has infected you with? Once you've meditated on those questions, Taurus, try these prescriptions: In the next 24 hours, take one step to reduce the level of anxiety you've accepted as normal. Take another step to diminish the power of your greatest fear. The astrological omens say you'll receive unexpected help if you do these things.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

You're a force of nature barely contained in your clothes, Gemini. You're elemental and irresistible; primordial yet playful. You're laughing like a river, dreaming like a volcano, and as surprising as a snowstorm on a summer day. You can talk the way the animals think. You remind me of a waterfall exuding fireworks. How could anyone not be drawn to you? How could anyone not feel a bit nervous while drinking in your unpredictable charisma? You're way over the top, and I like it very much.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Here's a friendly warning to keep in mind during these last few days of test and trials. It comes courtesy of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: "He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you." Would you like to avoid the fate he describes, Cancerian? (Say yes! Say yes!) All you have to do is relax with a heroic effort. Release every last ounce of tension and strain. Surrender, slacken, and slow down with a consuming passion for repose. And do not, under any circumstances, try too hard.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"I have a dream," Martin Luther King, Jr. sang during his stirring speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. on August 28, 1963. "I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal'
I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." To help get yourself into alignment with current astrological influences, Leo, read or listen to King's entire speech in the coming days. Let it inspire you to create your own personal "I have a dream" manifesto. It's high time you fantasized to the hilt about creating heaven on earth.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

If an astrologer from the old school were writing this horoscope, he might tell you that now is an excellent time to advance your ambitions through gossipy manipulation. But since you and I are in the business of creating a new civilization based on values that feed the soul, my take on your imminent future is different. I say it's a perfect moment to engage in uplifting gossip that serves the greater good. I suggest that you praise unsung heroes and name everything that's working well. The irony is that for people like us, dissing people always hurts our ambitions. One of the best ways to enhance our own possibilities is to use our power of speech to promote others' chances for happiness and success.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

When I'm mountain-biking on the ridge, I usually stick to the relatively smooth parts of the dirt trails. Now and then, though, I head straight towards the most jagged bumps and deepest pits. It feels good to test my sense of balance so dramatically -- to have to make countless split-second adjustments as my bike rumbles over the rugged terrain. Far from being a hardship, the sensation is exhilarating. I do it on purpose because it's fun. From my analysis of the astrological omens, Libra, I reckon you're now in a phase comparable to the one I just described. May you enjoy every minute of the wild ride.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Writing in Sky & Telescope magazine, Roy Gallant described how long it took for scientists to consider the evidence for meteorites. Until the 1800s, "the scientific community scoffed at those who believed stones fell from the heavens, though meteorites had been seen to fall and had been collected since ancient times by the Chinese and Egyptian
As stones continued to rain down from the sky, learned scientists explained them away as condensations of the atmosphere or concretions of volcanic dust." Let this be a cautionary tale for you, Scorpio. There's a certain truth you've been dead set against believing, let alone seeing, even though the evidence for it has been steadily growing. This week indisputable proof will come pouring in. Don't pretend it's not there.

No one knows you better than you do, Scorpio. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Do you have a muse? If not, get one as soon as possible. You shouldn't go another week without a mysterious, inspiring creature to drive you wonderfully crazy. If you do have a muse that is doing a fine job in service to your feisty spirit, reward him or her. Throw an exotic party in an unexpected location with vivacious revelers. Buy or make a surprising gift that has a muse-like effect on your muse. There is a third possibility: Maybe you have a muse that lately hasn't been whipping you into the kind of delightful frenzy you need to keep your soul healthy. If that's the case, go off on a retreat together and come up with a new plan.

In her San Francisco Chronicle column, Leah Garchik reported an amazing fact about an outdoor concert hosted by famed tree-sitter Julia Butterfly Hill. The 10,000 people who attended left behind less than one dumpster's worth of trash, whereas a normal crowd that size would have filled ten dumpsters. I suggest you begin mastering this approach to waste production, Capricorn -- especially the psychic version of waste. That way, you will never again have to slog through the massive karmic clean-up you're having to endure right now.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

At a candy store last Easter, I heard a philosophical debate about Jesus-themed confections. "It's just not right to eat a symbol of God," one woman said as she gazed at a chocolate Christ on the cross. A man agreed: "It's sacrilegious. An abomination." An employee overheard and jumped in. "I'll ask my boss to take that stuff off the shelf," she clucked. I was tempted to say what I was thinking: "Hello?! The holiest ritual of Christian worship involves eating Christ's symbolic body and blood." But I held my tongue; I wasn't in the mood for a brouhaha. Now I can speak freely, though. Which is lucky for you, Aquarius, because here's the good news: You're at the peak of your capacity to blend sensual pleasure with spiritual inspiration. A great way to express that would be to feast upon a delicious embodiment of the god or goddess you love best.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Aquarius. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Your first image of power comes from "Volcanoes," a poem by Susan Katz: "A man in his glass house, inside the heart of a blizzard, harvests roses." Let it console you, Pisces, whenever you feel the world around you is hostile or apathetic to the masterpiece that's quickening under your care. Your second image of power comes from poet Emily Dickinson. She said she always knew when she was reading a good poem because it made her feel like the top of her head was about to come off. As you nurture your masterpiece, Pisces, you'll know you're on the right track if now and then you have the sensation she described.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I enjoyed "Matrix Reloaded," but I hope you won't see it or any film like it this week. It was loud, frenetic, pounding, bewildering, and epic: the exact opposite of what you need right now. You will thrive instead on intimate, subtle pleasures, Aries; you will come alive in the presence of understated, soulful influences that are full of nuance. The experiences that will lead you to your best destiny will awaken your sensitivity and move you to meditate on lyrical truths.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

In the series finale of the long-running TV show, "Touched by an Angel," the Madonna-like angel Monica is offered a promotion. All these years she has struggled to help one bumbling human after another climb up out of the gutter; now she has a chance to move up to the cushy job of supervisor, where she won't have to wrestle with so much chaos. But she turns down the gig, and chooses instead to stay at her job of redeeming the ragtag multitudes. I believe you'll come to a comparable juncture in your own life during the coming months, Taurus. One path will lead to more comfort and prestige; the other will bring more interesting challenges and inspiring surprises. I'm not sure what the right decision is, but the sooner you start ruminating about it, the more likely it is you'll do what's wisest for the long-term.

You're in a phase when you may be tempted to start food fights at fancy dinner parties, wrap toilet paper around the trees in front of your adversaries' houses, and regard the juvenile delinquents of cable TV's "South Park" as worthy role models. I hate to discourage you from indulging this instinct for uproar, since so much of it could be fun and liberating. Therefore, I'm going to authorize you to go right ahead. But please keep a fraction of your adult brain working in the background, ready to step in and halt the proceedings if you're ever about to, say, imitate the South Park kids' "How to eat with your butt" routine for your boss.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

If you're swallowed whole by a whale or a dragon this week, don't panic: It's much better than being chewed into little pieces before being swallowed, which is definitely not going to happen. And according to my reading of the astrological omens, while you may spend a few days in the belly of the beast, you will eventually be

expelled intact out the other end. Then it'll just be a matter of navigating the winding path back home. The entire experience will no doubt be humbling, Cancerian, but it will also have the salubrious effect of scouring you clean of a whole mess of karma.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"Can you find an imperfection on Halle Berry? We can't." So writes Hollywood.com's Scott Huver about the Oscar-winning beauty born under the sign of Leo. Huver also notes that People magazine has five times named Berry one of the 50 Most Beautiful People and that Playboy called her one of the 100 sexiest women of the twentieth century. And how does Berry herself feel about her looks? "To be totally honest," she told the German magazine "Journal fur die Frau," "most of the time I think I'm ugly." I absolutely forbid you to exhibit this kind of self-abasement in the coming week, Leo. You may not, under any circumstances, denigrate your own gorgeous radiance. It's crucial for both yourself and everyone you encounter that you celebrate your magnificence.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Leo. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"Nothing worse could happen to one than to be completely understood." So said pioneer psychologist Carl Jung. If you think what he said is true, you should take action immediately, because you're in imminent danger of being well understood by at least two people. If on the other hand you're confident you can handle the odd sensation of being seen for exactly who you are, do nothing other than what you're already doing.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Virgo. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Marriages in India are usually arranged by relatives of the bride and groom, and most couples who wed come from the same religion or caste. There are daring rebels who ignore those customs, though, and choose to marry for love. One of their champions is a social worker named Biswanath Ramachandra Champa Swapnaji Taslima Voltaire. He has launched a new political party for lovers called the Lovers' Green-Globalist Godfree-Humanist Party. "Only those who love can effectively change society," he says, "and my new party will be their platform." I bring this up, Libra, because it's a perfect astrological moment for you to launch your own Lovers' Party. You have a growing knack for bringing intimacy and tenderness into political struggles. When helping your tribe deal with its dilemmas in the coming weeks, you'll be able to summon ingenious expressions of compassion.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

My dream last night informed me that if I hoped to compose an accurate horoscope for you, I'd have to go to the Outback Steakhouse near my home. Since I don't eat red meat, I initially felt a bit irked. But I've learned over the years that it's dumb to ignore a direct order from my dreams. I know, furthermore, that it's not enough just to go through the motions: My dream wanted me to have the full Outback Steakhouse immersion experience. So I obeyed with an open heart, dropping all my vegetarian sensitivities as I devoured "The Mad Max," described by the menu as "a serious burger for warriors only." By the end of the meal, with my astrological charts spread before me, I'd intuited the advice you need: You should seek out encounters that are as unlike your usual inclinations as this one was for me.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In the generic science fiction movie on cable TV last night, the hero's spacecraft happened upon the interplanetary equivalent of a junkyard. Aging shuttle pods and out-of-commission satellites floated around a decrepit space station. Soon a salesman appeared on the ship's view screen, trying to convince the hero to browse through his extensive collection of valuables, gathered from over a hundred different planets. "Take a look," the huckster chirped brightly. "You may find something you never knew you wanted!" Those words or something similar will be coming your way from the entire universe this week, Sagittarius.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

"History is made out of the failures and heroism of each insignificant moment." This observation by the writer Franz Kafka has special significance for you right now, Capricorn. Every little action you take will have unimaginable weight, and the cumulative effect of your many little actions may alter conditions you'd assumed were impervious to change. Even your passing thoughts and idle fantasies will have more influence than usual to shape your future. Until June 20, there will be no such thing as a trivial detail for you. My advice? Act as if each moment is a promise of the life you want to be living next October.

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Capricorn? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"The universe is full of magical things," said British novelist Eden Phillpotts, "patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper." It's another way to express my belief that life is a conspiracy to shower us with blessings, but most of us have developed ingenious strategies for eluding those blessings. The good news, Aquarius, is that your wits have recently grown sharp enough to detect magical things that were previously invisible to you. You will soon rise up and divest yourself of one of your main methods for avoiding joy and success.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

I'm of the opinion that the psychological problem known as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) is merely the pathological version of a normal phenomenon. Most well-integrated people have a variety of selves, any one of which may reign supreme at a given moment. The difference between the healthy folks and the unfortunates who suffer from MPD: Each of their many selves is in pretty good shape and on friendly terms with all the others. With these thoughts as an introduction, Pisces, I encourage you to celebrate your own flourishing multiplicity in the coming week. The astrological omens suggest it's time to throw a party for your entire community of selves!

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Writing in "Poetry Flash," critic Andy Brumer reminisces about the creative writing class he took with poet Stan Rice at San Francisco State University. "I remember sitting in class," he muses, "thinking this teacher is working harder at teaching than I am at learning." Please don't let a similar laziness overcome you, Aries. You're entering a phase when the educational possibilities are rich. To take advantage of them, you'll have to match the high intensity and fertile imagination of your teachers. (P.S. Your teachers may be in disguise, not necessarily calling themselves teachers.)

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

If you're a carpenter, this is a perfect astrological moment to get that 115-piece titanium-covered drill bit set you've had your eyes on. If you're a potter, it's prime time to get a state-of-the-art ceramic saw. If you're a political activist gearing up for a new direct-mail campaign against corporate corruption, you might consider buying the "Utne Reader's" mailing list. And if you're none of the above, Taurus, I suggest you acquire whatever tool will help you rise to the next level of professionalism in your chosen field.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

When the bearded dragon lizard sits upright and cocks its head towards the heavens, Australian Aborigines know that rain will fall the next day. And when massive buds appear on the queen wattle plants, even the youngest members of the tribe can prophesy with confidence that brushfires will break out soon. I have a different system of signs, just as reliable, that tells me how to read your moods and trends, Gemini. For instance, last night I dreamed my oldest Gemini friend told me, "The bee fertilizes the flower it robs." Because I have had the very same dream other times over the years, usually late in the month of May, I have come to understand its predictive meaning: Many Geminis all over the world will soon commit a benevolent "theft."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Soon the planet Saturn will enter the sign of Cancer, where it will remain until July of 2005. During that time you will have excellent opportunities to become more skilled in finishing what you start. You'll find it easier to calm your restless heart and commit yourself to a single choice out of the hundreds of options that interest you. Say goodbye to mediocre pleasures and misaligned priorities, my fellow Crab! In the next two years, you will attract unexpected help any time you stop fiddling around on the peripheries and head straight to the core of the matter. Best of all, you'll finally figure out beyond a doubt where you truly belong -- as opposed to being half-sure of where you sort of belong.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

You've primed to commune much more intimately with the hidden source of power that fuels your life. In fact, you're close to meeting the requirements defined by visionary poet William Blake. He wrote: "Unless the eye catch fire, God will not be seen. Unless the ear catch fire, God will not be heard. Unless the tongue catch fire, God will not be named. Unless the heart catch fire, God will not be loved. Unless the mind catch fire, God will not be known." Your eye, ear, tongue, and heart are on the verge of igniting, Leo. Do whatever's necessary to make that happen, and your mind will burst into flame, too.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

More than seven centuries before a few European men dared to sail beyond the safe boundaries of their known world, entire Polynesian families crossed vast expanses of the Pacific Ocean in catamarans. The first humans to arrive in Hawaii, they were led by "wayfinders." These miracle workers navigated the uncharted seas by reading star positions, discerning weather patterns, and interpreting the ocean's colors and movements. I want to make a connection between you and those pioneering souls, Virgo. In recognition of the brave, exploratory urges now ripening in you, I hereby give you the honorary title of "wayfinder."

No one knows you better than you do, Virgo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Good news, Libra: You will continue to be the beneficiary of expansive cosmic energies. In last week's horoscope, I compared these gifts to the power of the spoken Hawaiian language to open the heart and eyes of those who hear it. This time I propose several Hawaiian names for you to adopt as your own. They're all in alignment with your evolving destiny. You are hereby authorized to call yourself Kaohinani, which means "gatherer of beautiful things." You may also refer to yourself as Makaike, "to see with keen powers of observation;" or E'e'e, "to keep climbing over everything, as an active child;" or Wai-puhia, "wind-blown water, especially the spray of a waterfall." (Thanks to the book Hawaiian Names, English Names, by Eileen Root.)

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In 1991, hikers in the Italian Alps discovered the largely intact body of a man who died 5,000 years ago. He'd been preserved in a glacier that had recently begun to melt. Since then, many women have asked to be given some of the iceman's frozen sperm so that they might become pregnant by him. (The director of the museum where his body is kept has so far turned down all requests.) While I don't recommend that you become one more seeker of this prehistoric insemination, Scorpio, I do suggest you pursue a metaphorically analogous quest in the coming weeks: Try to fertilize yourself through an intimate encounter with the past.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Scorpio. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

My acquaintance Jerry likes to play his guitar for the spinner dolphins that hang around Maui's La Perouse Bay. They appreciate it. When he runs out of songs, he often joins them for a convivial swim. One day four months ago, a commotion at sea moved Jerry to interrupt his concert. Paddling out for a closer look, he found a woman swimmer surrounded by the dolphins. The normally friendly creatures had hemmed her in, as if herding her. But when their buddy Jerry showed up, they parted their tight circle to let him through, and he was able to escort the woman back to shore. The two hit it off instantly, began dating, and recently got married. Why am I telling you this, Sagittarius? Because I predict that like Jerry, you'll soon receive extraordinary, maybe even non-human, help with your love life.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

In 752 AD, the Japanese Empress Koken wrote a lyrical poem in praise of the eupatorium plant, whose leaves turn a vivid shade of yellow in summer. Recently, scientists punctured the illusion she was under, demonstrating that the lovely foliage of the eupatorium is caused by a disease virus. In my view, though, this shouldn't diminish our appreciation of either the poem or the plant. I've noticed that a lot of the world's beauty forms in response to a wound. In fact, I expect you're in the midst of that very process right now.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Our planet is running out of many essential resources, including fresh water and oil. Now the "Weekly World News" has reported yet another crucial shortage: the global supply of supermodels. "The original generation of supermodels is fading," the paper says, "and very few new ones are coming along to replace them. Soon the supermodel as we know it may become extinct." Can anything be done to avert this catastrophe-in-the-making? I'm not sure. But I do know that many of you Aquarians are exceptionally attractive right now, and likely to become even more so in the coming months. Might you therefore consider launching a career as a supermodel? At the very least, I suggest you look for ways to use your growing beauty to help save the world.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

A century ago, the Hawaiian sugarcane industry required a ton of water to produce a pound of sugar. Since then, improvements in irrigation techniques have drastically reduced the excess. The ratio of water to sugar is now 1:1. In a similar development, it used to take me about 2,000 words of exploratory free-writing to arrive at a single 120-word horoscope. These days I typically have to churn out no more than 400 words in the process of distilling your weekly oracle. In yet another related development, Pisces, I predict you'll soon make a comparable move towards less waste and greater efficiency in your own area of expertise.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

My friend's uncle, an Aries entrepreneur, is now in Iraq, investigating the possibility of building a new Disneyland-like theme park in Baghdad by 2007. Meanwhile, my masseuse's cousin, also an Aries, is hoping to become the first full-time clown in Antarctica; he has a patron who works for a British survey team there. Another Aries I know is a psychotherapist who's seeking to donate his services in the civil war-torn Congo. I nominate them all to be your role models. It's time for you to consider plying your best skills in places you've never imagined might need them.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Ancient Hawaiians had a sport they called "Lele Kawa," in which they dived off cliffs into the ocean. "Pu'u Keka'a," a tall volcanic cinder cone in West Maui, was a perfect place from which to jump, but everyone avoided it. Legend held it was a taboo place: "the leaping place of the soul," where the souls of the recently dead left the earth and ascended into the spirit world. But that all changed one day in the 19th century when a great warrior, Chief Kahekili, climbed to the top of Pu'u Keka'a and plunged into the sea, shattering the taboo and mutating the myth. Since then, hundreds of other divers have tried it. By my reckoning, Taurus, you now have the courage and daring to make a comparable shift in the way things have always been done in your sphere. Ready to shatter a taboo and mutate a myth?

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Mokuola is a small island off the coast of the big island of Hawaii. In the old days it was reputed to have curative powers. Seekers who went there in quest of healing had to help stir up the magic, though; they couldn't just lie back and expect the spirits of the place to do all the work. One way a visitor could ensure a long life, according to legend, was to swim underwater around the island three times. This emphasis on a participatory style of healing parallels a situation in your life, Gemini. Although you're now within reach of a rejuvenating influence, you'll have to collaborate with it aggressively in order to coax out its full benefits.

No one knows you better than you do, Gemini. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

As the sun set on a gorgeous spring day a few weeks ago, my companion accidentally left her purse beneath the Western world's biggest Buddha statue at a serene Buddhist mission near a Maui beach. Whoever found it chose not to return it. In contrast, on a chilly night last January, I lost my wallet on a litter-strewn street in a San Francisco slum. The woman who found it spent an hour on the phone until she tracked me down, then drove 20 miles to deliver it to me personally. The moral of the story, as far as it applies to you in the coming week, Cancerian: It's preferable to lose something of value in a poor, homely place than in a rich, beautiful place.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Even on Hawaii's most elegant beaches, the water can be wild. Rip currents and rogue waves come out of nowhere, sweeping swimmers out to sea. Local inhabitants echo what the travel guides warn: Never turn your back on the ocean. In general, it's a good idea to observe similar caution when dealing with any elemental force of nature. Having said that, though, I'll note that this is one of those rare times when you Leos could actually get away with turning your back on the ocean, metaphorically speaking. Maybe that's because you yourself are, at least for now, an elemental force of nature.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Leo. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Your sense of mission should be heating up, Virgo. Your tribe needs you more than usual. Your potential is ripening at the same time it is becoming most useful to your cohorts. But wait: That doesn't mean your path will be effortless in the coming weeks. There will be adversaries and agents of confusion you'll have to outwit. In order to be a radiant instigator of beauty and truth for your allies and a cagey master of strategy when dealing with your competitors, I recommend the paradoxical approach Jesus described: Be as pure and harmless as a dove and as wise as a serpent.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I'm writing this horoscope in Maui, where I've fallen in love with the Hawaiian language. It doesn't matter that I don't understand the literal meaning of many Hawaiian words. Their melodious, expansive rhythms have a magical effect that's both soothing and stimulating. While listening to a native speaker, I find myself perceiving my surroundings more vividly. My defense mechanisms subside, my heart opens, and I relax into a more receptive relationship with the whole world. I predict that a similar mood will soon bless you, Libra, whether or not you hear Hawaiian. Expect a long surge of alert, empathetic curiosity.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

I know a sailor who was aboard a submarine that bombed Iraq with cruise missiles last March. He said that in the days leading up to the attacks, the crew's regular entertainment hour featured a steady diet of porn videos authorized by the top brass. The sailor figured this was a weird form of motivational psychology meant to pump up the testosterone levels of his fellow warriors as they prepared to unleash America's destructive fury. He felt terribly conflicted about it. While he believed then and still believes that the war on Iraq was the right thing to do, he hated this pathological approach to psyching up the troops. He refused to watch the porn and tried to talk other sailors into boycotting it. In the spirit of his integrity, Scorpio, I urge you to renounce the philosophy that the end justifies the means. You can't afford to do bad things in the name of following your heart.

Many of you Sagittarians have a tortured relationship with discipline. You know you need it if you hope to fill your life with epic adventure. But you sometimes resist planning ahead and marshalling your resources, feeling that would interfere with having more immediate, short-term fun. Trouble is, though, when you avoid planning and marshalling, the short-term fun you get caught up in is often trivial and unsatisfying. That's the bad news. Here's the good news: You're in a phase when you can make a dramatic shift in your relationship to discipline, rendering most of what I just said irrelevant.

You're entering puberty again! Congrats! It'll be on a higher octave than last time, so you'll have more savvy to deal with the hormonal rush. To facilitate this unpredictable foray into serious goofiness, I'm happy to present you with the wisdom of sixth grade girls I know, gleaned from sayings they've scrawled on their backpacks and binders. Enjoy. Understand the groove. Learn as if you'll live forever. Explain yourself wildly, not carefully. Wake up -- but not too fast, or you might hurt yourself. Question authority, including the authority that told you to question authority. It's all so funny -- how can you not be laughing? When you shout "halaluya," never spell it right. Live the freakiest truth. Give me chocolate or I'll scream.

A German woman who recently died bequeathed her nephew $275,000. Trouble is, he's a homeless man who wanders around a lot. Executors of the woman's will have not yet been able to locate him. This resembles a situation in your own life, Pisces. Even now, a rich source of blessings is trying to track you down and attract your attention. So far you've been oblivious. Let's hope you wake up to the presence of the gift very soon.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Whenever I hike up to the ridge near my house, I feel a surge of admiration for a certain oak tree I pass. Unlike its companions, which are pointed skyward, it's growing sideways out of the hillside. It's robust and flourishing, yet in staunch rebellion against its community's standards. I call it the Aries oak, because it reminds me of what you're like when you're at your best: unique and healthy; bucking the status quo but never in a way that damages you; not fiercely and fumingly independent, but casually and blithely so. I suggest you aim to strengthen your alignment with this ideal in the coming weeks.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The self-help book Women Who Love Too Much deals with a theme that has gotten a lot of play in the past 15 years: If you're too generous to someone who doesn't appreciate it and at the expense of your own needs, you make yourself sick. An alternative perspective comes from French philosopher Blaise Pascal, who said, "When one does not love too much, one does not love enough." He was primarily addressing psychologically healthy saints, but it's a good ideal for the rest of us to keep in mind. This week, Taurus, your assignment is to explore the middle ground between the extremes represented by those two positions. Experiment and ruminate until you discern what amount of giving is just right for you.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

To paraphrase one of Amy Gerstler's poems, this week will taste like cough syrup. Sorry to have to report that, Gemini. But on the other hand, the bitter flavor will be offset by a sweet aftertaste that's lent to the mix by a secret ingredient I'm not yet at liberty to divulge. And the unpleasantness of the medicine going down will be even more compensated for by the tonic effects that will begin rippling through your life as early as next week.

An Italian law student, Antonella Magnani, was entering the last stages of her pregnancy as her final exams approached. She hoped the two rites of passage would not transpire too close to each other, but fate had other plans. Her labor pains brought her to the hospital at the exact time her test was scheduled. The law school examiners refused a postponement, but agreed to conduct their questioning in the delivery room. I believe this scenario is an apt symbol for the dual challenge you will soon face, Cancerian. In a sense you'll be giving birth as you take a final exam. (P.S. Magnani had a healthy baby and got a good grade.)

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Just in time for zero hour, Leo, I'm happy to add a new term to your vocabulary: kairos. It's Greek for "time of destiny, critical turning point, propitious moment for decision or action." Since you're at that exact phase in your cycle, I thought you'd be ripe to learn the word for it. Here are further subtleties you might be interested in. Kairos refers to a special season that's charged with significance and in a sense outside of normal time; its opposite is chronos, which refers to the drone of the daily rhythm. When you're in kairos, you have the power and duty to act like the sovereign of a sacred land.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I predict you will have a lavish amount of composure this week. It won't be tainted by arrogance or feelings of superiority, either. And it won't be fueled by a need to prove anything to anyone. Rather, your poise will flow from your strong new link to your soul's code -- the life blueprint you decided on before you were born.  One more thing: While you will be calm, you won't be passive or laidback. This will be an electrifying variety of relaxation.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Dear Dr. Brezsny: Does astrology work differently in Texas? I've lived all over the world, and I've found Libras who live in Texas to be unlike Libras everywhere else. Normal Libras love beautiful things, seek harmony, and see opposing points of view as well as their own. But every Texan Libra I've ever met loves beautiful things only if they're big and loud, seeks harmony only if there's something in it for him, and acknowledges opposing viewpoints only if it helps him win the arguments he loves to start. Your opinion? -Natural-Born Texan."

	Dear Natural-Born: I was born in Texas and have three planets in Libra, so I'm not objective enough to comment. I do know this, though: Many non-Texan Librans will soon exhibit the behavior you described as typical of Lone Star Librans. But I think that's a good thing: an antidote for Libras' sometimes-excessive politeness.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

On those rare occasions when journalists deign to report a UFO sighting, they dutifully and dryly describe eyewitness accounts. But their juices start to flow when they offer the derisive dismissals of skeptics they've interviewed about the incident. This is typical: "Astronomy professor X said that even trained pilots can be fooled into thinking the planet Venus is a flying saucer." I wish this approach were applied to other kinds of news. Imagine a CNN anchorman regurgitating the words he heard at a Pentagon news conference, then calling on leftist scholar Noam Chomsky to provide a skeptic's perspective. This is exactly the approach you should take to every story you hear this week, even those told by friends, family, co-workers, and acquaintances: Make it your burning mission to get alternate points of view.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Among his many fine tips for creating poetry, John Hewitt provides one that would be useful for you to apply in your own field of endeavor during the coming week. "Write the worst poem you can possibly write," he advises. "Use clich√©s and pretentious words, and beat your reader over the head with your point. Felt good, didn't it? Now get back to work. The point is, don't be afraid to write a bad poem. If it takes a hundred bad poems before you can produce a poem you like, fine, get that hundred out of the way." You're entering a phase, Sagittarius, when you may have to wade through a heap of junk you don't care for before you find the gem you really want. (Hewitt's webpage is here.)

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Novelist H.G. Wells once said, "If we want to have an educated citizenship in a modern technological society, we need to teach them three things: reading, writing, and statistical thinking." In my own list of essential expertise for today's educated person, I'd include reading and writing but replace statistics with the science of cultivating happiness or the art of carrying on a healthy intimate relationship. I bring this up, Capricorn, because you're now in a phase when you can learn a lot in a short time about those two skills.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Many men believe they'll never find romantic happiness unless they can hook up with a woman who resembles a supermodel or film star. Tragically, their libidos were imprinted at a tender age by our culture's narrow definition of what constitutes female beauty. They steer clear of many fine women who don't fit their absurd ideal. This addiction to a physical type is not confined to hetero dudes, however. Many straight women, for instance, wouldn't think of dating a bald, short guy no matter how interesting he is. That's the bad news. The good news is that with sincere effort, anyone can shed the outmoded imprints that prevent them from being turned on by otherwise attractive partners. You, Aquarius, are in a phase when you have increasing power to do just that.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

You need the soul medicine that only a wild place can provide. Civilized habits are eating away at your instinct for happiness. The insidious taint of omnipresent commercialism is infecting even your purest desires and noblest ambitions. You owe it to your sanity, Pisces, to run away to a power spot that is immune to human manipulation -- a sanctuary where nature is so big and free and intense it will dissolve the petty obsessions your ego has gotten twisted up in. What are you waiting for? Leave as soon as possible, and don't come back until you're scoured clean.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Advising an Aries to have more patience is like commanding a bonfire to burn in slow motion. Nevertheless, I am at least going to make the effort. Therefore, please be aware that if you would like to place yourself in maximum alignment with cosmic trends, you should find a way to be perfectly content as you watch and wait; you should figure out how to enjoy dwelling calmly in a state of trusting faith; and you should fantasize freely about the delights that will come to you if you cultivate quiet, relaxed confidence.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Before the 1820s, the mosquito was unknown in Hawaii. But when whaling ships from distant lands began visiting, they brought hordes of the annoying creatures as stowaways in their water casks. I suggest you keep this scenario in mind in the coming week, Taurus; let it serve as a warning beacon. According to my astrological assessment, the new world you have recently begun to inhabit resembles a paradise without mosquitoes. You may have to take special measures to keep it that way, like prohibiting whaling ships from dropping anchor in your harbor -- or the metaphorical equivalent.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

I hope you have a spiritual path. It doesn't matter what kind, as long as you have some relationship with a benevolent source of life and love beyond your little ego. Having said that, I also want to advocate the importance of not taking your spiritual path too damn seriously. Grave fanaticism in any form, even if devoted to a noble cause, is dangerous not only to your mental health, but also to that of the people around you. This week it will be especially important for you to be playfully mocking towards that which you hold most sacred. Examples? Put underwear on a Buddha statue, insert a dirty limerick into your prayers to the Goddess, enjoy some heavy petting in a synagogue, visualize yourself tickling Jesus.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I'm on my periodic Oracular Scavenger Hunt, wandering the globe trolling for fresh metaphors to inspire my prophecies. While visiting the Hawaiian island of Molokai, I've found one that is a good fit for your current astrological aspects. Though many roads crisscross Molokai's 260-square-mile expanse, there is not a single traffic signal anywhere. By my reckoning, this closely resembles the terrain you will be traveling over in the next two weeks: not a red light in sight.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

I'd like to give fair warning to your inner critic, your pessimistic tendencies, and the part of your psyche that harbors lowered expectations. In the coming months, the astrological omens will be compelling me to forecast a high level of health, happiness, and "hallelujah"-shouting. So if you would prefer to remain stuck in outmoded fantasies about your unworthiness, I suggest you avoid my horoscopes for the foreseeable future. If, on the other hand, you're ready to boost your faith in your ability to get what you want, please stay tuned.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I'm smarter in some parts of the earth than in others. In Florence, Amsterdam, and Milwaukee, my IQ is off the charts. In Munich, Madrid, and Washington, D.C., I'm rather dull-witted. Even in Northern California, where I usually live, some places are more conducive to my higher brain functioning. I'm an idiot on Market Street in San Francisco, for example, whereas I'm awash in wise insights whenever I set foot on Mt. Tamalpais. What's this about? The specialized branch of astrology called astrocartography would say that the full potentials of my horoscope are more likely to emerge in certain power spots. In the coming weeks, Virgo, I urge you to investigate the possibility that this phenomenon holds true for you, too. Wander around and test to see where you feel most in tune with your deep, brilliant self.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

At a recent concert, devotional singer Krishna Das recounted a story of escorting his revered teachers, a frail old Indian couple, to an acupuncturist in New York. They had to walk through a neighborhood dominated by strip clubs, prostitutes, and drug dealers. Every few feet, a new salesperson approached with an offer of crack, weed, crank, or sexual adventures. Krishna Das worried about subjecting his beloved guides to such a degrading experience, but they were unfazed. "This is heaven," said the woman. When a surprised Krishna Das asked what she meant, she replied, "Heaven is any place where one's needs can be met." My wish for you this week, Libra, is that you be as open-minded as she was about where heaven might reside for you.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Scorpio actress Rachel Ticotin has appeared in many movies, including "Con Air," "Natural Born Killers," and "Full Disclosure," but my favorite is "Total Recall." Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, it's a science fiction thriller that largely takes place on a human colony on Mars. Ticotin plays a sleazy but demure hooker who is secretly a rebel freedom fighter plotting to overthrow the corrupt, oppressive government. Can you imagine any better role for a Scorpio? It's a perfect example of how your tribe's dark side can be expressed constructively. I suggest you find or create your own equivalent in the coming weeks.

British veterinarian nurse saved the life of a five-foot king snake a few weeks ago. While giving birth, Nipper stopped breathing, whereupon Claire Farina administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until the creature's respiration resumed. I'm not predicting that you will literally give the kiss of life to a serpent in the coming week, Sagittarius, but I imagine you'll pull off the metaphorical equivalent. How, exactly, I can't say. Will you rescue a hissing slitherer? Will you expand your capacity to express wild kindness?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

After much research, I decided to stay at the Napili Sunset condo during my stay in Maui. The travel guide promised me that for a modest price I'd enjoy spacious views of ocean and garden. And now as I sit composing your horoscope on my lanai at the Napili Sunset, I can indeed see aquamarine waves breaking majestically in the distance. In the foreground, my eyes are thrilled by the sight of lush orange hibiscus flowers and red torch ginger. The only element not mentioned in the guidebook is a parking lot where there's a large dumpster crammed so full of garbage bags that the lid can't close. Will I let this intrusion spoil my idyllic enjoyment? Hell, no. Likewise, Capricorn, I hope you won't let a single glitch darken your otherwise fantastic run of good fortune in the coming week.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"I am superior to you only in one point," Narcissus tells Goldmund in Hermann Hesse's novel Narcissus and Goldmund. "I'm awake, whereas you are only half awake, or completely asleep sometimes. I call a man awake who knows in his conscious reason his innermost unreasonable force, drives, and weaknesses, and knows how to deal with them." I am borrowing this pithy little speech for your horoscope, Aquarius. You, too, are only half-awake. But you're now in prime time to find out much more about your innermost unreasonable force, drives, and weaknesses -- and become more skilled in dealing with them.

No one knows you better than you do, Aquarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Western science and religion have differing views on how the universe was created, but they agree that it happened a long time ago. Tantra and other less publicized spiritual traditions, on the other hand, assert that the universe is recreated anew in every moment through the divinely erotic play of God and Goddess. They say that if we humans treat love-making as an experimental sacrament, we can attune ourselves to the union of the two primal deities and, in a sense, participate in the ongoing creation of the world. So are you up for some cosmos-generating sex this week, Pisces? The astrological omens say you are.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Are you the kind of Aries who pushes on doors that have "pull" signs? Do you think it's a thrill to open cartons from the end that reads "open other end"? Do you love to drive in the carpool lane when you're alone in your car? If so, I hope I can convince you to use your rebellious energy more constructively. You're now in possession of the finest insurrectionary energy I've seen in many moons. Your brilliant disobedience could overthrow a status quo that's sorely in need of being replaced.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

A fresh fad has broken out among university students in China: drinking milk from baby bottles. Psychologists decry this as regressive behavior, claiming it represents a subliminal yearning to return to childhood and avoid adult responsibilities. I suppose that may be true if it becomes habitual. But I'm going to recommend that you take up the practice for just one week, Taurus. Make it a ritual that helps you reclaim your innocence and see the world with the eyes of an unspoiled kid.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

"I'm too frustrated to do what it would take to get myself unfrustrated." Has a thought like that crossed your mind recently? I bet it has. Or how about this: "I'm too confused to figure out what questions I'd need to ask to clarify the issues." Again, I'd be surprised if you haven't felt that way in the last few days. What to do about it? Here's my solution: Stop the world. Drop out of your trance. Run away to a sanctuary where you can make time stand still for a few days. Empty your mind, relax your ambitions, and steep yourself in primal silence.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

From a psychological and spiritual perspective, Cancerian, it's harvest time. The moment has come to reap the fruits you've sown since last July. Judging from my astrological analysis, I believe your yield will include an abundance of ripe beauties and just a few ripe uglies. And even those uglies could serve you well if used as fertilizer for your next round of planting, which is scheduled for the weeks after your birthday. (P.S. Here's my guarantee: If you don't rake in emotional riches very soon, I'll eat your shoe. In the unlikely event your harvest is paltry, send your shoe to me at P.O. Box 150628, San Rafael, CA 94915.)

Leo (July 23-August 22)

"Sometimes the mountain is hidden from me in veils of cloud," Denise Levertov wrote in her poem called "Witness." "Sometimes I am hidden from the mountain in veils of inattention, apathy, fatigue, when I forget or refuse to go down to the shore or a few yards up the road, on a clear day, to reconfirm that witnessing presence." This week, Leo, you're more likely to be hidden from the mountain than vice versa. If it happens, though, it won't be due to inattention, apathy, or fatigue, but because of your intense attunement to your own magnificence. This is not a bad thing in itself, of course, but it will be if it keeps you from communing with the mountain. Therefore, see if you can do both: Be an alert witness full of self-love.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

In New York last January, a talking carp began shouting religious advice in Hebrew to an Hispanic food preparer who was about to turn it into a meal. The restaurant owner came in to investigate the commotion and became a second witness to the event. The New York Times reported the story, and soon a local Hasidic sect was proclaiming the fish's message to be a direct communication from God. Though many people laugh with derision when they hear this tale, I retain an open mind. The Divine Trickster has appeared to me in equally unusual forms. No doubt you will share my perspective by the end of this week, Virgo. You're about to have a visitation that's maybe a little less mysterious than a talking fish, but not by much.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

I never dreamed that one day I'd have a pet wasp. But here she is, buzzing tenderly around my head as I compose this horoscope. I call her Scheherazade. She has been here three weeks. I lost all fear she would sting me after the first day, when she landed on me several times without incident. She seems content with the food and drink I leave out for her, and I swear that now and then she performs aerial tricks for my entertainment. I love having this whirring ally around. Her presence leads me to imagine that I really have learned to get along with wild forces of nature without having to control or hurt them. I encourage you, Libra, to seek your own version of a wasp companion.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Some people refer to me as an astrologer, novelist, or musician. Others call me a shaman, magician, or teacher. I don't mind their attempts to sum me up, but I never refer to myself by those terms. My business card says I'm an "Aspiring Master of Curiosity, Apprentice to Crazy Wisdom, and Macho Feminist." Why? First, I don't want to get trapped in the elitist egotism that can arise from identifying with a label like "shaman." Second, careerism is anathema to me. I want the freedom to keep mutating and not be enslaved to my past accomplishments. Third, I never want my life to be defined by my job. Fourth, I claim the exclusive right to name and title myself. No one else can have that power. I recommend that you Scorpios experiment with a similar approach in the coming weeks.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Every year around July 4, the county where I live stages a huge four-day fair. Along with carnival rides and live music, it sponsors amateur competitions in hundreds of categories, from quilt art to pickled vegetables to decorated birdhouses. Judges give out awards to the best entries. This summer's fair will add an unusual new class in the horticultural department: A prize will be awarded to the person who grows the tallest weed. Here's my prediction: The winner will be a Sagittarius who begins the project this week. As for the rest of you Archers: You're also primed to capitalize by cultivating things that are normally thought to lack value -- and you won't have to wait till July to cash in.

"If the wrong man uses the right means, the right means work in the wrong way," says the ancient Chinese book, The Secret of the Golden Flower. Conversely, "When the right man uses the wrong means, the wrong means work in the right way." These thoughts, Capricorn, are all you need to succeed this week. You're free to come up with your own interpretation of their implications, but here's mine: High integrity and a noble purpose sometimes count for more than cleverness or skill.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Literary critic Harold Bloom believes Finnegans Wake was James Joyce's masterpiece -- the closest thing our age has come to the genius of Shakespeare and Dante. Novelist Anthony Burgess called it "a great comic vision that makes us laugh aloud on nearly every page." Yet when Joyce was writing the book, his wife Nora hated it, calling it "chop suey." She asked him why he didn't make "sensible books that people can understand." Joyce's patron, Harriet Weaver, also derided Finnegans Wake, saying it was a waste of his genius. Luckily, like many Aquarians, Joyce was mainly loyal to the little voices in his head, not the little voices outside of his head. Draw inspiration from his example in the coming week.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

To compensate for the fact that the amount of available time is steadily shrinking, I've intensified my multitasking. I now meditate while washing dishes. I pay bills and write poems and practice singing while stuck in traffic jams. I read the newspaper, surf the Web, make business calls, eat lunch, and organize my schedule while peddling my exercise bike. As a happy and unexpected result, my brain is definitely working better; I've gotten smarter. This regimen isn't for everyone, of course. But if you do have an interest in increasing your intelligence, Pisces, now is a perfect astrological moment to make it happen.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

You're at the peak of your ability to explore the mysteries of shapeshifting. If you're of a mystical or shamanic bent, I encourage you to try out a variety of animal identities in your meditations and lucid dreams. If you'd prefer an earthier approach, you could incorporate the wild intelligence of a favorite creature into your daily behavior. How about a fox? Its influence could assist you in cultivating sly ambition, a worthy project for you in the coming days.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Esquire magazine quoted a renowned astronomer's surprising idea about the origin of the cosmos. "The big bang is so preposterous," said Allan Sandage, "and the chain of events it set off so unlikely, that it makes most sense when thought of as a 'miracle.'" For the sake of argument, Taurus, let's assume Sandage is right. If the beginning of the universe itself was a miracle, then everything in it is impregnated with the possibility of smaller but equally marvelous miracles. All of which is apropos for your life in the coming week. I believe you're now primed to birth an amazing feat that your rational mind might find hard to believe.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

The task you have ahead of you, Gemini, has a resemblance to -- well, wait a minute; before I go on, I should warn you that the following reference is rather graphic. Proceed only if you're not easily offended and have a supple sense of humor. Anyway, as I was saying, the task ahead of you has a resemblance to carrying out the artificial insemination of a rhinoceros. "But it's impossible to artificially inseminate a rhino!," you may be saying. Well, no, it's not. In fact, with the help of a tool invented by scientists, zookeepers all over the world are regularly doing it nowadays. Likewise, you have a new metaphorical tool that will make it feasible -- not easy, but feasible -- to do the metaphorical equivalent.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In the weeks leading up to the Academy Awards ceremony, Oscar nominees are called on to talk about themselves endlessly. Because of the nonstop parties they attend, they must cultivate a tolerance to extreme levels of interesting fun. Maybe most challenging of all, they've got to flaunt their stylish charisma with almost superhuman intensity. In the three weeks before the big night this year, for instance, actress Ren√© Zellweger wore 40 different dresses. And what does this have to do with you? Although you normally have little in common with film stars, that should change in the coming days. You have astrological license to talk about yourself far more than usual, experience a high degree of fascinating fun, and array yourself in a variety of vivacious clothes.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Many scholars believe the original Garden of Eden was where Iraq stands today. Though remnants of that ancient paradise survived into modern times, many were obliterated recently. One of my spies who lives near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers has kept me posted on the fate of the most famous remnant: the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Until a few weeks ago, it was a gnarled stump near Nasiriyah; but today a crater is all that remains. This can serve as an evocative symbol for you as you tackle your big assignment for the rest of 2003, Leo: Completely demolish your old ideas about paradise so that you can conjure a fresh new vision of it.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

One of my early astrology teachers, Isabel Hickey, had a favorite saying: "Before you can give yourself away, you have to have a self to give." This should be your seed meditation for the foreseeable future, Virgo. I am not implying that you don't have a self. But you do have a lot of work to do to define and strengthen your sense of who you are. In the coming weeks, I'd love you to visualize a flame in your heart growing steadily bigger and brighter and hotter.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Do you believe there is such a thing as the human soul? If not, you should stop reading right now; I'll talk with you again next week. But if you do believe, how would you define it? More importantly, what does your own soul feel like? I suggest that in the coming week you make frequent attempts to tune in to that elusive essence. Use all your ingenuity and persistence as you try to create a stronger bridge between your everyday awareness and your heart source, your seed code, your eternal song.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

In my astrological opinion, it's a perfect time to introduce more experimentation into your most promising relationship. To stimulate your imagination, here are a few ideas you and your companion might want to try together. 1. Go outside just after midnight, wail five loud cock-a-doodle-doos, then run back inside before you're caught. 2. Describe to your friend or partner a detailed vision of his or her best possible future. Ask for the same treatment in return. 3. Borrow the approach of the religions that have rituals of eating their gods. Buy a pastry that makes your mouths water, perform a ceremony in which you invite a divine spirit to enter into it, then slowly devour it while gazing in each other's eyes.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

A month ago my Sagittarian friend adorned her car with her first-ever bumper sticker, "Give Yourself to Love." While proud of announcing her compassionate philosophy to the world, she was also nervous. Hadn't she raised the pressure on herself to live up to her noble ideals? A week later, she snapped. A guy gabbing on a cell phone in an SUV cut her off in traffic, and road rage moved her to give him a middle-finger salute. Next day she added a new bumper sticker to the left of the first: "Get In, Sit Down, Shut Up, Hold On." When I asked her about the contradiction, she confessed, "I've just accepted that I've got a split personality." Today brought a further development. She pasted the word "and" to the space between the two stickers, to create a new thought: "Get In, Sit Down, Shut Up, Hold On, and Give Yourself to Love." She called to tell me the good news: "I'm whole again!"

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Are other people luckier than you? If so, you can do something about it, according to psychologist Richard Wiseman. His book, The Luck Factor, presents research that proves you can learn to be lucky. It's not a mystical force you're born with, in other words, but a habit you can develop. How? For starters, be open to new experiences, trust your gut wisdom, expect good fortune, see the bright side of challenging events, and master the art of maximizing serendipitous opportunities. I mention this, Capricorn, because you're now in a phase when you can make tremendous progress in enhancing your capacity to attract luck.

This may sound strange and improbable, but my inside sources swear it's true: If you'd like to stay out of hot water, metaphorically speaking, you should literally immerse yourself in hot water more than usual in the coming week. In other words, you can stir up a protective, benevolent magic by taking a lot of long baths, soaking in hot tubs, and playing around in warm swimming pools. And if there's any way you can get away to a hot spring for a day or two, you'll virtually ensure that trouble won't be able to find you.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

On certain occasions, I encourage you to sacrifice your own needs for the sake of others', or try to heal their wounds before you attend to your own. But this is not one of those times. It wouldn't be in alignment with the cosmic mojo. What, then, would be the most righteous course of action? Here's what I think: Rouse your most imaginative brilliance as you dream up ways to be really good to yourself. Shower yourself with gifts, treats, and blessings. Take all that tender loving care you're so skilled at administering to others, and bestow it on yourself.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Anyone who is in the habit of bestowing gifts and blessings on others is a candidate for sainthood. Generosity is one of the greatest virtues. But there is a related quality that surpasses it: the ability to give without any strings attached, without any expectation of being appreciated or praised for one's largesse. How'd you like to begin working on a mastery of this demanding skill, Aries? The coming weeks will afford you ripe opportunities. (P.S. For those of you who are political activists, remember the Dalai Lama's thought: You should work as hard as you can to reduce suffering and foster justice -- accepting that all of your efforts may come to nothing in the end.)

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Who or what will rescue you, Taurus? A divine intervention, perhaps? A sympathetic friend who totally understands you? A teacher who knows exactly what you need at this turning point? I suspect the answer is none of the above. Don't worry, though, because a brave hero is on the way, primed to provide you with an exit, a solution, and a cure. And who is this great deliverer? For a clue, I give you this poem by Simeon Samuel Frug: "No savior from without can come/ To those that live and are enslaved./ Their own messiah they must be,/ And play the savior and the saved."

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Taurus? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Here's what I wrote in my journal on an April night ten years ago: "Ever since I learned to see three sides of every story, I've been coming across much better stories." Here's what I overheard from a woman in the grocery store check-out line today: "I'm not saying that truth is always relative, but I have often found it to be fluid, slippery, vagrant, scrambled, promiscuous, and kaleidoscopic." And here's a favorite saying of seminal TV newscaster Art Amadon: "I get my way more often now that I have more than one way." What else do you need to know to prepare for the upcoming week, Gemini?

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

In the 1950s, scientists developed methods to synthesize artificial diamonds in the laboratory. But it's only recently they have mastered technology that allows them to grow small natural diamonds into bigger ones very quickly and without any flaws. I suggest you make this your operative metaphor in the coming weeks, Cancerian. You'll be wise to mobilize all your resources as you rapidly expand the part of your life that is most like a diamond. It's time to expedite the evolution of your valuable beauty.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

My daughter's sixth grade class will perform a play this spring, as it has the last five years. The script, an adaptation of a tale from "The Arabian Nights," features a magical talking bird as a key character. One of the students, a Leo, asked the teacher not to give her that role, as plum as it is. Why? Because she wants to avoid any further typecasting: She has played the part of a bird in three of the last four class plays. I urge you to consider making a similar stand, Leo. You'll soon be offered a chance to squeeze yourself into a coveted niche you've occupied before. I'm not saying you shouldn't do it; just think long and hard about the baggage that comes with it.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

"What if you stumbled on a person living in the dark, starved, chained, drugged and poisoned?" asks futurist Jay Gary. "You'd turn on the light, unlock his chains and nourish him back to health. That poor soul is the human imagination -- yours and mine." I agree with Gary's assessment. Our imaginations are in bad shape, numbed by the media's nonstop onslaught of fear-provoking, spin-doctored, soul-killing "information." The situation is tragic. Imagination is not just a playful capacity we call on when we're making art, after all. It's our ability to form mental pictures of things that don't exist yet; it's what we use to shape our future. But here's some good news, Virgo: You now have special power to rehabilitate and reinvigorate your imagination. Get in there and turn on the light, unlock the chains, and nourish it back to health.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

My acquaintance Judith decided to go all out in helping her daughter sell Girl Scout cookies. She filled her garage with cases of all nine varieties in preparation for a marketing onslaught on friends and neighbors. Then one night disaster struck. Raccoons exploited a hole in the roof to break in and plunder the stash. But while the marauders ripped open boxes of every cookie type, they ate only one: the Samoas, also known as Carmel deLites, which are covered in caramel, sprinkled with toasted coconut, and laced with chocolate stripes. In the coming week, Libra, I urge you to be like those raccoons in this one regard: Unleash your passionate hunger very precisely. Don't go after what you sorta kinda like; pluck only the treats you long for with all your heart.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Want to get the most out of your upcoming adventures, Scorpio? Then adopt an outlook that combines the objectivity of a scientist and the "beginner's mind" of Zen Buddhism. To pull this off, you'll have to suspend your theories about the way the world works. Realize that what you've learned in the past won't be a reliable guide to understanding current events. Be skeptical of your biases, even the benevolent ones. Try to see the naked truth, stripped of the interpretations that your emotions might be inclined to impose.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

It's time to purify your intentions, Sagittarius; time to make sure that you love what you love and seek what you seek for only the best reasons. For inspiration, memorize this poem by the eighth-century Sufi mystic poet, Rabia: "I carry a torch in one hand/ And a bucket of water in the other:/ With these things I am going to set fire to Heaven/ And put out the flames of Hell/ So that no one worships God/ for fear of hell or greed of heaven."

No one knows you better than you do, Sagittarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

You don't realize how fertile you are, Capricorn. Nor can you possibly comprehend how much more fecund you will become in the coming weeks. That's why it's so lucky you have tuned in to this horoscope. Just in time, I am alerting you to your awesome generative power, ensuring that you will be very thoughtful and discriminating about which seeds you sow. About six months from now, therefore, you will most certainly harvest great big beautiful fruits, not great big ugly weeds.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

To those living in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Star is the second most important star. Also known as Polaris or Pole Star, it is always directly overhead all night long. Compared to the other stars, which come and go, it's a bastion of stability. Throughout history, it served as a beacon aiding the navigation of sailors. That's why it became a symbol for a homing signal or guiding principle. Synonyms for "polestar" include focal point, gist, marrow, pivot, root, and crux. In your own life, Aquarius, what is the metaphorical equivalent of the North Star? According to the astrological omens, it's time to make adjustments and do upkeep in your relationship with that hub. (For those of you in the Southern Hemisphere, your equivalent is Sigma Octantis.)

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Aquarius. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Early in his career, Robert Bly rarely wrote love poetry, though he studied the work of others who did. As he aged, he stopped reading the angst-ridden ruminations of modern poets and sought out the ecstatic love poetry of mystics like Rumi and Kabir. Increasingly, forgiveness and compassion became central aspects of Bly's emotional repertoire. His rage about his own past romantic disappointments dissipated. In his mid-forties, he wrote Loving a Woman in Two Worlds, his first collection of love poetry. A critic in the New York Times Book Review said it wasn't a real book of love poems, because there wasn't enough hatred and anger in it. To which I say: Ha! Your assignment this week, Pisces, is to write a love poem and think love thoughts from which all hate and anger have been purged.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I've been scouring herbal textbooks and tantric literature to find out if there's such a thing as a labor-intensive aphrodisiac -- in other words, a stimulus that would inspire you to work hard to become a fantastic lover. I'm not saying your amorous skills are inferior, Aries, just that there's room for improvement. The coming weeks will be an excellent time, astrologically speaking, to apply yourself to this worthy project. And if I do run across that labor-intensive aphrodisiac, I'll let you know. In the meantime, pursue the leads that your intuition provides. And remember this: The capacities that make you a great lover have only marginally to do with physical techniques and mostly to do with emotional intelligence and spiritual ingenuity.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The astrological factors coming to bear on you right now are uproarious yet profound; they're mischievous, intense, and catalytic. In alignment with this spirit, I've composed your horoscope by channeling appropriate bumper sticker slogans. Repeat the following affirmations frequently, Taurus, or print them on pieces of paper and tape them to your back. 
	"Don't follow me; I'm following my bliss." 
	"I'm not tense -- just terribly, terribly alert." 	
	"I don't suffer from insanity; I enjoy every minute of it." 
	"I'm talking to myself -- please don't eavesdrop."
	 "Don't worry -- it only seems kinky the first time." 
	"Warning: I have an Attitude and I know how to use it."

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

How to be the best Gemini you can be? A  reader named Shimmering Elf wrote eloquently about that topic. His words should be helpful as you face this week's Gemini-enhancing tests. "Be amazed with and in awe of yourself," Shimmering Elf began. "And try to keep doing new things to justify your amazement and awe. Be like the Native American heyoka who rode his horse backward, wearing only an apron in a blizzard, with sweat running down his chest. Talk to yourself; people can join in if they want to. Have a large papier mach√© ego; redecorate it often. Be like Grandmother Spider who created the world by imagining it. Be like Pygmalion and fall in love with your creation. Never imitate. Be a tricky, sticky tickler. No one will ever solve the Sphinx's precious riddle if she doesn't know the answer herself."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

It's time to go straight to the source, Cancerian. Eliminate the middlemen -- and the middlewomen, too. Don't believe anyone who claims that he alone can connect you with the valuable stuff you need. As much as possible, wean yourself from translators, agents, and brokers. And don't worry: This won't result in you becoming lonely and isolated. I predict that whenever you shed a relationship with someone who uses and exploits you, you'll open the way for a new link with a person who is respectful of your gifts.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In a recent article in a British tabloid, Leo diva Madonna spoke contritely about why she published the controversial book Sex back in 1992. "I was just being an ego-driven nutcase," she confessed. This admission impressed me. Everyone makes bad decisions motivated by out-of-control egotism, but few of us have the courage to admit it -- let alone a celebrity that the press regards as a megalomaniac. I suggest you draw inspiration from Madonna's example in the next few days, Leo. If you cop to a past outbreak of unseemly arrogance, I predict you'll unleash magic that will ultimately spawn fresh accomplishments for which you can be righteously proud.

Famed TV producer Sherwood Schwartz had a hand in making more than 700 TV shows, and he co-authored theme songs for the sitcoms "Gilligan's Island" and "The Brady Bunch." Every year he collects about $60,000 in royalties for those tunes, written so many years ago. I'd like to alert you, Virgo, to the fact that you're now in a phase similar to the one Schwartz was in when he got inspired to compose those long-term money-makers. It's time to create a legacy for yourself.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

In his book Crying: the Natural and Cultural History of Tears, Tom Lutz asserts that people don't cry as much as they used to. The English of the Victorian era, supposedly renowned for their stuffy behavior, put us to shame with their abundant outpouring of tears. So what's our excuse? There's as much, if not more, to be mournful about nowadays; and we certainly don't suffer from a lack of events to spur our cathartic joy and empathy. Would you like to volunteer to do something about the modern weeping deficit, Libra? In the coming days, you'll have rich opportunities to unleash tears of breakthrough and release.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

I direct your attention, Scorpio, to Dawn Baumann Brunke's book, Animal Voices: Telepathic Communication in the Web of Life. There she champions the value of communing clairvoyantly with other species. Learning this skill is not only helpful for becoming closer to beloved pets, she says. It can also be useful for pest control. She gives examples of people who rid their homes of ants and spider mites simply by striking up telepathic conversations with them. My theory is that this same approach can be applied to pests in human form -- especially by you in the coming week. Rev up your considerable mental powers, and psychically ask jerks, annoyances, and bores to stop bugging you.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

When I recorded my last music CD, a major label spent $180,000 on my band's recording sessions at a state-of-the-art studio. The resulting music was exciting, but sales were paltry due to the company's inept marketing strategy. The new album I'm working on with my friend George is low-tech and self-financed, done completely on his computer in his bedroom. The experience is humbling but exhilarating. I'm free of my old rock star fantasies. There's no danger of having to deal with the alienating influences of fame, constant travel, and the insanity of the music business. I have the relaxing luxury of creating music just because it's fun. I recommend that you make a comparable transition, Sagittarius. Which of your aptitudes and inclinations would you enjoy more if they weren't hemmed in by unrealistic dreams, oppressive duties, and the stultifying pressures of careerism?

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

Your horoscope this week consists of the words of poet Mary Oliver, whose "White Pine" describes an experience analogous to one you'll soon have: "I have read that, in Africa, when the body of an antelope, which all its life ate only leaves and grass and drank nothing but wild water, is first opened, the fragrance is almost too sweet, too delicate, too beautiful to be borne. It is a moment which hunters must pass through carefully, with concentrated and even religious attention, if they are to reach the other side, and go on with their individual lives."

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

While out on a walk, I laughed with incredulity and derision when I spied a front yard where gorgeous poppies and tulips were in full bloom -- surrounded by an eight-foot-tall cage of chicken wire. Once my instinctive response subsided, I realized there was probably a rational reason for the apparent lunacy, like maybe it kept the flowers from being devoured by marauding deer. My next thought leaped to you, Aquarius. I knew that the fortress protecting the delicate blooms was a perfect metaphor for what you should create for yourself in the coming week.

No one knows you better than you do, Aquarius. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Feeling bereft because of the war, I found myself longing to connect with sources of inspiration that have fueled me over the years. I scoured closets, shelves, and storage lockers, collecting power objects from every period of my life. They included the books I've written and C.G. Jung's Psychology and Alchemy, photos of my daughter and the woman I love, a painting made for me by a friend, my favorite baseball card from childhood, and many other treasures. In the ensuing days, I made the freaky discovery that five other people I know had independently felt the urge to undertake a similar gathering. A ritual like this would be perfect for you right now, Pisces. I suggest you assemble 22 of your most important symbols and create a sanctuary to protect you from the world's chaos.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

America's invasion of Iraq will unleash far-reaching consequences that profoundly affect every one of our personal lives. In the coming months, we'll encounter events that require us to revise our understandings about the very nature of reality. Our imaginations will have to be ingenious and our hearts alert in order to keep up with the exotic changes. To locate truth amidst relentless waves of propaganda, we'll have to be fiercely disciplined and tenderly hate-free. To avoid being infected by popular delusions, we'll have to cultivate compassionate lucidity, humble courage, and a determination to rouse beauty everywhere we go. You, Aries, are the logical choice to serve as a supreme role model for the approach I've just outlined.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

The ancient Egyptian creator god Ptah was regarded as a miracle worker, though sometimes he used unconventional means to accomplish his amazing feats. For example, legend held that he defeated a legion of Assyrian marauders with an army of rats. Waiting till the enemy soldiers were asleep, Ptah sent the rats into their camp to gnaw through their bowstrings and shield handles, rendering them defenseless. Can you imagine a way in which you might draw inspiration from the Egyptian god's methods, Taurus? How could you win a great victory by summoning the help of an influence you usually regard as a pest?

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Self-anointed "debunkers" rail against astrologers' predictions, acting as if speculating about the future was a crime against rational thought. Meanwhile, economists, meteorologists, sportscasters, trend analysts, and political pundits are out there regularly making bad prognostications based on dubious data. In my opinion, they spread more delusion and cost people more money than those of us who divine cosmic omens. For example, the National Weather Service's forecasts fail to anticipate more than half of all tornadoes and flash floods. But do debunkers denounce them as quacks? Never. Sorry for the rant, Gemini, but I have a prophetic point to make: Every single hypothesis about the future that you are aware of now and that you hear about in the next four weeks will be wrong -- except, of course, this one.

It's Freethinkers Week, a holiday created especially for you Cancerians. To celebrate this liberating grace period, indulge in any of the following festive acts: 1. Declare your independence from anyone to tries to tell you, either subliminally or directly, who you are or how you should live your life. 2. Declare your independence from your past, especially memories that oppress your sense of possibility and self-images that inhibit your urge to explore. 3. Declare your independence from peer pressure, groupthink, and conventional wisdom. 4. Declare your independence from your previous conceptions of freedom so that you'll be free to come to a completely fresh understanding of it.

It's prime time for you to acquire a pair of lucky pants. How will you know they're lucky? Because they'll endow you with an intuitive sense of where to walk in order to have adventures that'll inspire you to see the big picture. It will also be a favorable week for you to rummage around in thrift stores until you find a pair of magic X-ray specs that'll give you the power to perceive the secret motives of everyone you gaze upon. Wait! There's one more piece of spooky good news. I predict you'll soon have a vivid dream in which you explore what's hidden below the tip of the iceberg.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

I love it when I'm so energized and purified from riding my bike up Mt. Tamalpais that I experience a lightning bolt of realization about some crucial truth I've been hiding from myself. I love it when I'm walking through the city's trash-spattered concrete jungle and am suddenly blessed with the fresh smell of dirt from a renegade garden. I love it when the pathological decisions of bad leaders inspire my tribe to redouble its commitment to fight for outrageous peace, ingenious love, and wild understanding. What about you, Virgo?

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Your idealism is one of your greatest assets, but it can also be a liability. Driven to seek beauty and harmony, you sometimes become blind to the messy truth. That's why I was so pleased to get the following oracle when I consulted the ancient Chinese book of divination, the I Ching, on your behalf: "It is only when you have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any self-deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events by which the path to success may be recognized." I interpret this to mean that you are about to temporarily suspend your idealism in order to see the messy truth, which will in turn lead you to an opportunity to practice your idealism on a higher level.

In their book An Incomplete Education, Judy Jones and William Wilson list the favorite colors of famous poets. T.S. Eliot loved eggplant, sable, and mustard. Wallace Stevens preferred vermilion, chartreuse, and wine, while Ezra Pound liked ivory and jade. In light of current astrological omens, which are nudging you in the direction of greater subtlety and precision, I urge you to draw inspiration from these poets' lyrical tastes. Refine your definitions of your favorite everything, Scorpio: colors, smells, feelings, tastes, physical sensations, tones of voice, types of wind, qualities of light -- everything.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

During a 15-month-long period in 1888 and 1889, Vincent van Gogh churned out more than 200 works of art. In one ten-week stretch he produced an average of a picture a day. I predict that you will soon slip into a comparable phase, Sagittarius. Original ideas will come surging up into your awareness with such relentless exuberance that you'll be hard-pressed to catch them all. Quick: Decide where you want to channel all that prolific creativity; don't let it leak out wastefully.

Prize-winning gardener R.J. Harris has no interest in astrology or New Age notions. And yet, like generations of his family before him, he carefully monitors lunar cycles. Practical observation, not superstition or philosophy, has proved to him that certain parts of the cultivation process go best when done during certain phases of the moon. In his book, R.J. Harris's Moon Gardening, he suggests sowing the seeds of below-ground crops right after the new moon. (Like now, for instance.) In the early days of the second quarter, he advises, plant seedlings and above-ground crops. (April 9-12.) At the outset of the fourth quarter (April 23), add fertilizer to the soil. Prune later in the fourth quarter. (April 28-30.) I happen to believe, Capricorn, that these same principles apply to your own growth.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

I've been following the progress of a patch of ground a mile from where I live. A year ago it was a grubby gully, a no-man's land between two suburban McMansions. A ruined shack, long abandoned, stood at the bottom, imprisoned by thick underbrush. Six months ago, bulldozers arrived to clear away the thickets and raze the rotting wood structure. Three months ago, another crew arrived to contour the land and create a level spot for construction. Metaphorically speaking, Aquarius, that's where you are in your life right now. Your next step is to do the equivalent of what happened this past week, when the foundation was poured for a new home on the land that was once a grubby gully.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

In accordance with astrological omens, I have selected two words that convey the role you're best suited for in the coming week. The first is the Yiddish term tummler, derived from tumlen, to make a racket. A tummler stirs up a commotion, makes things happen, and incites people to action through his or her affectionate agitation. Clowning and pranks may be part of a tummler's repertoire. Your second word of power, Pisces, is the Iroquoian ondinnonk. It has two related meanings: 1. a secret wish of the soul; 2. the angelic part of our nature that longs to do good deeds. Now here's the punch line of your oracle: Let your ondinnonk guide you as you carry out your mission as a tummler.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

It's Reinvent Your Persona Week, Aries. To stimulate your imagination, pretend it's Halloween for the next seven days. Today, dress up as a skanky biker chick or dude. Tomorrow, be a transgendered Bulgarian princess in exile. In the days after that, be a snake-dancer, drag-racer, CIA agent, professional wrestler, and rodeo clown. Don't just get creative; get outrageously creative. APRIL FOOL! While it is a perfect time to reinvent your persona, and while it's wise to inject more wildness and badness into your style, there's no need to indulge in random experimentation. You already know exactly which way to go.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Aries? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Life is a bitch and then you die. The more you suffer, the more you learn. If you can't dazzle them with your brilliance, baffle them with your bullshit. If all else fails, manipulate the data. APRIL FOOL! Everything I just said was a dirty lie. I was testing to see how trusting you are of "experts" like me -- and how susceptible you are to letting your mood be manipulated by stuff you read in the newspaper. The fact is, Taurus, you can no longer afford to absorb the pathological delusions about reality that are spread by the mass media. I recommend that you go on a fast from TV, radio, films, videos, newspapers, magazines and the Internet for 96 hours. By the end of that time, you will have begun to sense the real truth: that life is a benevolent conspiracy designed to bring you blessings and make you really smart. 

Want to explore the coming week even further, Taurus? Dig deeper? Feel stronger? Consider tuning in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Stand on a highway overpass and scream a dirty limerick into the wind. Memorize and recite your favorite commercial to a grocery store clerk. Get drunk and throw stones at beer cans. Write a love note to Bill Gates and send it to him in an envelope along with $5. APRIL FOOL! While it is prime time to give yourself to uninhibited departures from normal behavior, it's also important that they feel deeply meaningful. Try the following instead: Climb to a mountaintop and scream a provocative prayer into the wind. Recite an anti-war poem to the grocery store clerk. Meditate yourself into an altered state and throw rotten tomatoes at your personal symbol of evil. Write a short essay about your greatest longing, tie the paper to a helium-filled balloon, and send it aloft on a windy evening. 

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Gemini? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Make yourself as boring as possible, Cancerian. Avoid every risk that might force you to question your beliefs, and steer clear of adventures that could bring you into contact with people who aren't like you. You need to cultivate safety and security at all costs, and the best way to accomplish that is to hide in your room and do absolutely nothing. APRIL FOOL! I was just kidding. In fact, the best way to cultivate safety and security is to regularly seek out what interests and excites you. And the days ahead should provide ample opportunities to do just that.

How much do you want to know about your destiny in the coming week, Cancerian? How far do you dare to go? For more insight into your shimmering, undulating fate, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Sixty years ago, farmers had to wait an average of 12 weeks for a newborn chick to become an adult chicken. These days, thanks to the miracle of synthetic hormones, antibiotics, and profligate amounts of feed, the process takes six weeks. This amazing change in the life cycle of poultry should be an inspirational model for you in the coming months, Leo. It¬ís high time you started growing twice as fast. APRIL FOOL! Don't you dare try to force yourself to ripen at a breakneck rate. Speed up your pace, yes, but not by more than 20 percent.

No one knows you better than you do, Leo. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

It's the Grunting Season, my dear. Your luck will multiply and your alignment with cosmic rhythms will grow whenever you engage in activities that provoke your copious grunting. Bench-pressing? Hole-digging? Pot-washing? Floor-mopping? APRIL FOOL! I totally lied. You didn't believe me, did you? In point of fact, Virgo, it's the Sighing Season. Your luck will multiply and your alignment with cosmic rhythms will grow whenever you engage in activities that provoke your copious sighing. Gazing at gorgeous sights? Thinking deeply about the big picture? Making love long and slow?

Hungry for more inspiration, Virgo? Curious about the unfolding mysteries? For more juicy details about your destiny in the coming week, check out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Libra (September 23-October 22)

There are only two kind of people: those who align themselves with the forces of light and those who align themselves with the forces of darkness. And the whole world is now in the grip of a tremendous struggle between the two. You, Libra, must choose which side you're on, once and for all. APRIL FOOL! In fact, every one of us is a mix of good and evil. And it's prime time for you to become hyper-alert about how the two play out in you. Once you've acknowledged your own part in feeding the darkness, you'll have a lot more credibility as a fighter for beauty, truth, peace, love, goodness, and justice.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Libra. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Last January, I asked my readers to send me their anti-resolutions for the new year: their promises to cultivate weird habits, incorrigible vices, and controversial actions. A list sent to me by a Scorpio woman named Briana happens to be a perfect match for the kinds of behavior you Scorpios should indulge in during the coming week. She vowed to engage in more awkward dancing, loud singing, talking to herself, fascinating egotism, and guilt-free masturbation. Be like her. APRIL FOOL! Everything I just said will be good advice beginning around April 21, but not yet. For now, you really ought to be more demure, humble, and well-behaved than usual. It's a period of atonement and adjustment.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Scorpio. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

"What's the meaning of life?" "Who am I?" "Is there a God?" Questions like these are old and tired, and therefore totally beneath you, Sagittarius. It's time that your search for truth kicked into higher gear, leading you to dream up snappier inquiries about the nature of your existence. Try out the following, for example: "What can I do to make my friends and loved ones more perfect?" "Are there any shortcuts I can take to getting everything I want?" "How do I arrange to avoid all pain and have only pleasurable experiences?" APRIL FOOL! This is no time to abandon venerable questions like "What's the meaning of life?," especially now that you're on the verge of uncovering a host of insightful new answers to them.

Want more clues, Sagittarius? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

At the height of his power, Alexander the Great ruled an empire that stretched from Greece to India. According to legend, he wept because he had no more worlds to conquer. Sounds like you, doesn't it, Capricorn? How could you possibly accomplish any more than you already have? It's sad to think you have nothing left to prove. APRIL FOOL! The real truth is this: No matter how adept you are or how much territory you've seized, you've just begun to tap your full potential. Events this week will show you how many intriguing mysteries you have left to explore and master.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Capricorn? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

Your ego has been writing checks that your body can't cash. Your past has been making promises your future doesn't even want to think about keeping. Your inner beast has been cannibalizing your inner child. Shape up, hypocrite! APRIL FOOL! There has been a gap between your intentions and your effects, but not nearly as great as I implied above. Please forgive me; in the outrageous spirit of the prankster holiday, I was hoping the shock value of my extreme statements would motivate you better than a polite, gentle prod.

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Aquarius? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The sign on my optometrist's door reads, "If you don't see what you're looking for, you've come to the right place." That's a good rule for you to live by in the coming days, Pisces. The astrological omens suggest you should hang out in environments where none of your desires can possibly be fulfilled; you'll thrive in the company of people who can't help you reach your goals and don't have the slightest idea what you're interested in. APRIL FOOL! This week of all weeks it's crucial that you risk imitating a Scorpio; which is to say, measure every experience according to how well it serves your drive to get what you want.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

When you're at your best, Aries, you see the cracks in the facades as opportunities; you get giddy as you careen over bumps in the road; you love the enticing magic that flows from situations that other people regard as rough or crooked. Since you will soon be at your best again, I expect you'll be encountering a surge of juicy serendipity. Here's a quote to incite you, courtesy of Aries poet Charles Baudelaire. "That which is not slightly distorted lacks sensible appeal: from which it follows that irregularity -- that is to say, the unexpected, surprise and astonishment, are an essential part and characteristic of beauty."

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

One of your reliable tools isn't broken yet, but I advise you to fix it before it is. A power failure will occur soon unless you take steps to prevent a system overload. The monster in your closet is still safely asleep, which is why I urge you to call in an exorcist or exterminator now, before it wakes up.  Are you catching my drift, Taurus? Because you've been smart and lucky enough to tune in to this horoscope, you have all the forewarning you need to prevent a crisis.

No one knows you better than you do, Taurus. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

You know how a song can get stuck in your head and won't leave you alone? The astrological omens say you'll be unusually susceptible to this phenomenon in the coming week. I suggest, therefore, that you immediately begin working to ensure that you'll be invaded by only the most inspiring and motivating songs. As soon as you're finished reading this horoscope, make a list of your top five, then hum them for a while. Want some suggestions? How about "Cleanin' Out My Closet," by Eminem or "I See God in You," by India.Arie? Or maybe "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill," which ends with the lines "Deep in my heart the answer was in me/ And I made up my mind to find my own destiny."

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Just before my friend Juliana received the phone call informing her she'd gotten the dream job she'd applied for, she'd been devoutly depressed, reading tabloids and eating doughnuts in her pajamas at 2 p.m. When my friend Jessie got the call informing him he'd been chosen as a back-up singer for the world tour of a group he'd idolized for years, he was recovering from a nasty hangover while playing video games with his 10-year-old nephew, whose family was letting him freeload during his fifth month of unemployment. I'm not saying the lightning bolt that will illuminate your world will be as dramatic as these two examples, Cancerian; but a lightning bolt is a lightning bolt.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

In his book Animals and Psychedelics, ethnobotanist Giorgio Samorini proves that many animals deliberately alter their consciousness. His evidence includes robins that get drunk on holly berries and act "like winged clowns," as well as goats that are dependent on caffeine and reindeer that seek out hallucinogenic mushrooms. Samorini concludes that the desire to get high is a natural drive. He suggests that intoxication has served as an evolutionary force for some species, breaking down outworn habits in such a way as to improve long-term survival. All this is prelude to my advice for you, Leo: You now have a cosmic mandate to shed your shticks and expand your awareness. Since you're not just an animal, but also an ingenious human, you don't have to resort to drugs and alcohol to do it. But you should do it.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Leo. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Many otherwise intelligent people cling to a perverse model of intimacy articulated by Norman Mailer. As reported in Leah Garchik's column in the San Francisco Chronicle, Mailer described marriage as "an excretory relationship, in which you take all the crap you hide from the world and dump it on the person closest to you. But the proviso is that you have to be willing to take theirs." If your approach to intimate communion has even a shred of this vulgar stupidity, Virgo, you're now in prime time to banish it from your repertoire forever. You'll attract uncanny luck and inspiration whenever you work in a way opposite to Mailer's; that is to say, when you train yourself to call up all the beauty you hide from the world and offer it up to the person closest to you.

Want more clues, Virgo? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Your word of power in the coming weeks will be stretch. Intone it as a mantra 55 times a day and write it in red ink on an index card that you keep in a prominent place in your environment. In addition, Libra, I urge you to regularly embody these three meanings of stretch: 1. to make longer, wider, or bigger without breaking or tearing; 2. to straighten and extend your body to its full span so as to increase circulation and forestall cramps; 3. to carry out a demanding task that requires you to enlarge your capacities or go beyond what you thought was possible for you to do.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

You've been very resourceful in your efforts to push love to a new frontier, Scorpio. You've been an artist in the way you've reinvented passion and you've been a pioneer as you've dared to explore collaborations that require you to leave your comfort zone. Congratulations! Now I want to give you a tip that'll help ensure you don't undo all your good work. During the next three weeks, meditate often on these words, originally penned by poet Percy Bysshe Shelley: "Love withers under constraint: its very essence is liberty: it is compatible neither with obedience, jealousy, nor fear: it is there most pure, perfect, and unlimited, where its votaries live in confidence, equality, and unreserve."

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

I found a love note in the trashcan at the post office. It was addressed to "My Succulent, Surging, Sagacious Sagittarius" from "Your Perfectly Imperfect Instigator." "Let's be radically curious explorers together," Instigator told Sagittarius. "Let's bushwhack through the wilds in search of the rawest truths that the laws of nature will allow us to dive into." I was shocked to find this thing discarded. What Archer in his or her right mind would throw away such a provocative invitation? Please don't do anything resembling this mistake in the coming weeks, even if your potential collaborator is "perfectly imperfect."

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

I'm not writing this horoscope, Capricorn. You are. I'm channeling it from the depths of your innermost mind. Why? Your conscious ego has been so caught up in the daily whirl that it has been steadfastly ignoring an important message from your still, small voice, which is why your still, small voice has drafted me to be its envoy. Here's what it wants you to know: You desperately need to tune in to the still, small voice. The communiqu√© it has to convey to you is simple and brief, yet richer than 30 hours' worth of advice from 30 experts. It will help you save an enormous amount of time and pull off a constructive cosmic joke.

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

It's one of those blessed times when you'll heighten your attractiveness by thinking more deeply; when pursuing higher education will help you create conditions in which you can better satisfy your desires; when you can make yourself sexier by becoming smarter, and vice versa. In the spirit of this happy confluence of id and intellect, I offer you a few librarian pick-up lines, gleaned from www.lisnews.com. 1. "I'd luuuuuv to check you out." 2. "I couldn't help noticing what a great book bag you have." 3. "Are you a librarian, because when you walked in the room I knew I was overdue."

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Back in 1985, when my roommate Arlena asked her new acquaintance, Joey the escaped convict, to stay at our house for a few weeks, I overcame my propensity to be an overly patient, absurdly accommodating doormat. "There is no way in hell that Joey will ever spend even a night here," I told Arlena firmly, and despite her protests, I prevailed. I have an intuition that you will receive a comparable opportunity to exercise a strong and lucid new version of your willpower in the coming week, Pisces.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

I got an e-mail from a reader who calls himself Drek, Agent of the Future. His words are apropos to what you'll be living through this week. "How come in the long list of human fears, 'showing one's true self' is never included?" Drek mused. "Hell, compared to the frighteningly wonderful madness of tapping into our naked souls, stuff like snakes and public speaking really doesn't seem that terrifying." I trust you've already guessed what this has to do with you, Aries. It's a perfect moment to overcome your fear of revealing your raw beauty to the world.

Want to stay sane and healthy in the coming weeks? Then get up-close and personal with the animal that rules your sign. It won't be enough merely to gaze at images of bulls, though that would be good for starters. But if I'm reading the astrological omens correctly, you need to be in the actual presence of a robust, full-grown bull. To commune with his primal energy will be strong medicine. It'll awaken in you instinctual powers that have gone to sleep, and will galvanize you for the mysterious challenges ahead. Feel like going in search of a pasture where your teacher is waiting?

Before he died in 1992, avant-garde composer John Cage wrote the score for "As Slow As Possible," a piece of music designed to be played continuously for a long time. No one has ever actually tried it until recently, when a group of musicians and philosophers in Germany began a performance they hope will last for 639 years. Make them your role models, Gemini, as you launch your own long-term project in the coming weeks. It's the ideal astrological time to commit yourself with strategic patience to a labor of love that could take you all your life to master.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

I once knew a talented writer who had four planets in Cancer. With his fertile imagination, nurturing intelligence, and articulate artistry, he embodied the best of our tribe. With his narcissism, hypersensitivity to criticism, and habit of bearing a grudge, he also had some of our sign's well-known liabilities. It was always a risk hanging out with him; I never knew which facet would be ascendant. I haven't seen the guy for years, but I hope his sweet genius has found a way to tame his evil twin. If not, the coming weeks will be an ideal astrological time for him and for all of us Cancerians to win the war within us.

No one knows you better than you do, Cancerian. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Leo (July 23-August 22)

When I ran for president back in 1992, one of my campaign promises was an affirmative action program that would make a majority of Americans celebrities by the year 2005. Though I wasn't elected, I'm pleased to see that my idea may still come to pass. With the growing popularity of reality TV, from "Joe Millionaire" to "American Idol," increasing numbers of average citizens are getting the chance to bask in the limelight. Your special moment could very well arrive in the next few weeks, Leo. There've rarely been more favorable astrological aspects for you to become famous or notorious. You will at least become more widely known, or be gossiped about outrageously.

Hungry for more inspiration, Leo? Curious about the unfolding mysteries? For more juicy details about your destiny in the coming week, check out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Darien is a 45-year-old woman who had a near-death experience when she was 26. "My NDE was exactly like a rebirth," she told me, "so I have wondered for many years whether I really have two charts, one for my original birth and one for my rebirth. And if so, which should take precedence?" I congratulated her on how lucky she is to have such a rich mystery to work with, and I urged her to treat both charts as equally true. I mention this, Virgo, because although you won't have anything as dramatic as an NDE in the coming weeks, you will most likely experience what amounts to a resurrection. You might consider having another astrological chart drawn up for the official moment of your relaunch.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Virgo. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Libra (September 23-October 22)

"Dear Dr. Brezsny: Why do you sometimes refer to God as 'He'? You of all people know very well that God is both a 'He' and 'She.' Furthermore, 'He' has hogged the God references for 2,000 years. The only way to correct the distortion is to always refer to God as 'She' for the next 2,000 years. It's payback time, don't you agree? -Libra SuperWoman."
	Dear SuperWoman: You're absolutely right. From now on, God will be "She" in my column. But let me caution you not to take this as license to hate or demean the masculine aspect, either in God or in yourself. Especially now, as pathological expressions of macho run berserk in the world, we need to nurture beautiful forms of virility. In the coming weeks, it will be particularly important for Libras of all genders to reinvent and regenerate their inner male.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Libra. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Is it global warming? This winter has been even milder than usual in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I live. As a result, the roses in my backyard have been blooming nonstop since last April, failing to take their usual sabbatical between October and February. I like it, but it's also a little freaky and creepy -- and definitely not a healthy approach for a human being to emulate. So don't be like my unnatural roses, Scorpio. As relentlessly glorious and fascinating as you've been lately, you need to take a break. 

Want more clues, Scorpio? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

In a commercial for a new dream interpretation show on the SCI FI cable channel, a middle-aged man is planted on a couch, gobbling an oversized sandwich and gazing blankly into a TV. His wife, clad only in black bra and panties, saunters into the living room astride a massive white stallion. The man looks up at her briefly, then returns to his vegetative trance. A voiceover suggests that this is a dream about the wife having needs that the husband is not fulfilling. I predict that you will have a comparable dream in the coming week, Sagittarius. Both the man and the woman will symbolize aspects of your own life.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Sagittarius? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

I'm not one of those astrologers who insist on stereotyping you Capricorns as compulsively cautious, staid, and obsessed with order. In fact, some of the most imaginative and dynamic people I've known have been members of your sign. Still, the current astrological omens strongly suggest that it's time for me to remind you to take yourself less personally, less seriously, and less literally. Here's a quote, courtesy of novelist Tom Robbins, that you should put on your bathroom mirror for the next ten days: "Humanity has advanced, when it has advanced, not because it has been sober, responsible, and cautious, but because it has been playful, rebellious, and immature."

What greater adventure is there than exploring the enigmas of your unique destiny, Capricorn? For more hints about the week ahead, listen to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

You will soon have the power to see what has been invisible and to decipher codes that have been impenetrable. You'll shed a belief that has been crippling your intelligence, and you'll lose a "friend" who has been undermining your understanding of yourself. And that's not all, Aquarius. Just in time, you will shake yourself free of a curious numbness, allowing you to tune in to feelings that you desperately need to experience. And you will finally find the words to name truths that have been dangerously fuzzy.

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Aquarius? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

One of the most enduring stories from ancient Greece has been the set of events that legend says occurred at Troy, on the coast of Asia Minor. Yet this epic place, site of Homer's The Iliad, was a village covering only seven acres. Keep that factoid in mind in the coming week, Pisces. I believe it'll serve as the perfect metaphor for events that are currently unfolding in your own life. A humble patch of ground may become the scene of a mythic turning point. An experience that begins small may be the seed for a story that will achieve monumental importance for you in the years to come.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Pisces? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

"It was the biggest mistake I ever made, and yet it was the best thing that ever happened to me." When we spoke yesterday, that's how my Aries friend Ron referred to his relationship with his ex-girlfriend. He got involved with her for all the wrong reasons, he said, and they stayed together only because he held on so tightly to his delusions about her. But in the painful months since they broke up, he has harvested a wealth of wisdom about himself. He feels that will serve him in good stead the next time he takes the leap into love. "My time with Susan was equivalent to me getting my PhD in relationships," he concluded. Though the details of Ron's story may differ from yours, Aries, you're ready to make a similar conclusion: One of your big booboos was actually a stroke of great fortune.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Once the full impact of Einstein's theory of relativity became clear, an admiring journalist interviewed him about the process by which he'd arrived at the revolutionary breakthrough. "How did you do it?" the journalist asked. "I ignored an axiom," Einstein replied. Now let's analyze that statement for your use, Taurus. Einstein didn't say he'd ignored an opinion or theory, but rather an idea so well-established that it was regarded as self-evident. Furthermore, he didn't say he rebelled or fought against the axiom: He simply acted as if it weren't there. I suggest you follow his example exactly in the coming week.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

You're the zodiac's most inventive talker, but it doesn't always work to your advantage. Sometimes you sabotage your brilliant verbal forays by going on for so long that your listeners tune you out. On other occasions, you undermine your persuasiveness by sounding too damn smart, thereby intimidating the very people you're trying to convince. But I predict that none of this will be a problem for you in the coming days, Gemini. You'll have a sixth sense about when to let your mouth slip into creative hyperdrive and when, on the other hand, to slow it down. As a result, your ability to win friends and influence people will zoom to its highest levels in many moons.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

As I compose this horoscope, I'm sitting in my car with the engine off during rush hour, stuck halfway across the Golden Gate Bridge between San Francisco and Marin County. Traffic came to a dead halt 40 minutes ago due to a big accident. My situation is an analogue of the predicament you find yourself in, Cancerian. Through no fault of your own, you've been stopped while crossing a metaphorical bridge. Here's my advice: As you wait for the obstruction to be cleared, don't grind your teeth and curse. Instead, take advantage of the temporary interruption by doing something as useful as I am.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

Last November a flower-arranger named Stacie wrote to tell me about her latest creation. She'd walked into the dry autumn woods and gathered big purple thistles, gnarled berry vines, spiny horehound seedpods, and numerous plants with burrs. After she assembled it all into a bouquet back home, she gave it a title, as if it were a sculpture. She called it "Ode to Prickly Things: My Beautiful Fear." Though she hadn't realized what she was doing, she had assembled a perfect artistic expression of the subtle dread she always carried with her. To see it embodied so visibly had an effect comparable to an exorcism. From that day on, she felt much freer of her chronic anxiety. I suggest you take inspiration from her, Leo. Perform a ritual or make some art that gives you power over the thing you're most afraid of.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Empty your mind of everything it thinks it knows about where you belong, Virgo. Once you've created a wide open space, launch an inquiry into the nature of your true home. Here are some questions to guide you. 1. What's the first place you think of when you hear the word "sanctuary"? 2. What environments bring out the best in you? 3. Do you have what you might call power spots, and if so, what do they feel like? 4. What places on the planet captivate your imagination, even if you've never even been there? 5. Is it possible there may be a future home that's a more meaningful version of home than the place where tradition comforts you?

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Chanteuse Billie Holiday believed a good singer should never sing a song the same way twice. All the tantric sex teachers say an artful lover never makes love the same way twice. The only Zen master I know -- whose name I can't tell you because she changes it every week, and I haven't heard the latest one -- likes to quote the ancient Greek philosopher, Heraclitus: "You cannot step into the same river twice, for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you." These ideas are always useful to keep in mind, Libra. But during the next three weeks, they should be your constant meditation.

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

Writer Michael Tortorello has complained about the "national delight deficit." My friend Lanny bemoans the public's shrinking attention span for stories about joyful events and satisfying breakthroughs. I myself have marveled at the pathological tendency of many educated people to equate cynicism with intelligence. It's in the context of this stupefying collective addiction to dank moods that I give you your assignment, Scorpio: You, more than any other sign of the zodiac, are now primed to harvest an abundance of pleasure, mirth, and fun. Please don't keep it all to yourself; try to infect everyone you meet.

No one knows you better than you do, Scorpio. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Ocean floors are not flat and level. In some places, underwater mountains rise to tremendous heights. Hawaii's Mauna Kea is taller than Mt. Everest, for instance, though only its uppermost part pokes above the sea's surface. Other submarine peaks, like the recently mapped Atlantis Massif in the Atlantic Ocean, are completely hidden beneath the waves. Let these be your metaphors of power in the coming weeks, Sagittarius. You'll soon discover and explore your own mysterious equivalent of underwater mountains.

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

If you're a Capricorn journalist, this is the week you could get a Pulitzer Prize-winning scoop from a drunken slaughterhouse worker about a likely E. coli outbreak. If you're a Capricorn parent, you'll have a lightning bolt of insight into the destiny of your child, forever changing the way you guide him or her. If you're a Capricorn songwriter, I bet you'll channel a melody or lyrics that will become one of your signature songs. And if you're any other kind of Capricorn, you'll be the beneficiary of a rich revelation that will be as valuable to you as a huge windfall.

Your destiny is a gorgeous mystery, Capricorn. Your soul is awakening more every day. The secrets of life are ripening right in front of your eyes. For more clues, consider checking out your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

"Id" is a psychoanalytic term. It refers to the part of your mind that harbors your instinctual needs and drives. On the one hand, your id is the source of tremendous amounts of psychic energy. On the other hand, it's almost totally unconscious. Think about it, Aquarius: The primal, dynamic core of your life force is mostly invisible and unknown to you. For most people, this is a good thing. It would be painful and scary to be fully aware of the id. In the coming week, however, you will benefit from being in conscious contact with this high voltage potential. I suggest you begin immediately. Mindful that your id is like a smart but wild animal, invite it to show itself.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Aquarius. To explore even deeper, dive into your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

Astrology asserts that we humans are puppets of cosmic forces that are beyond our power to affect, right? Wrong. In fact, the opposite is the case: Studying the nature of archetypal energies helps us direct them in constructive ways. In her book, Making the Gods Work for You, astrologer Caroline Casey articulates this view, suggesting that with enough ingenuity we can actually get divine powers to be our collaborators. Here's another way to say it: Ask not what your planets are doing to you, but what you can do with your planets. I bring this up, Pisces, because you've never been in a better position to persuade the cosmic forces to serve your free will.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Is hope overrated? While it can provide consolation when life is painfully confounding, the Sufi poet Rumi suggested that it may actually get in the way of finding a cure. "When water gets caught in habitual whirlpools," he wrote, "dig a way out through the bottom to the ocean. There is a secret medicine given only to those who hurt so hard they cannot hope. The hopers would feel slighted if they knew." What if Rumi was right, Aries? Speaking on behalf of the astrological omens, I advise you to let hopelessness be your guide in the coming week.

Taurus (April 20-May 20) 

Some astrologers theorize that there's an undiscovered planet called Vulcan, whose orbit is inside that of Mercury. Because it's so close to the sun's obliterating blaze, scientists haven't detected it. In ancient Roman mythology, Vulcan was the god of metal-working. From his forge beneath the earth, he made tools for himself and the other gods. His creations were renowned for both their usefulness and beauty. The astrologers who propose the existence of the planet Vulcan say it's the ruler of Taurus. I bring this to your attention because it so happens that you're poised to channel its influence with maximum strength in the coming weeks. Try this meditation: Visualize yourself wielding controlled fire to forge beautiful and useful things for you and your powerful allies.

Gemini (May 21-June 20)

Each year the science magazine, "Annals of Improbable Research," awards "Ig Nobel Prizes" to imaginative eccentrics. A prize in chemistry was once given to researchers who discovered that romantic infatuation is biochemically indistinguishable from obsessive-compulsive disorder; other prizes have gone to the "Stalin World" amusement park, software that can detect a cat walking on a computer keyboard, and a report on "Courtship Behavior of Ostriches Towards Humans Under Farming Conditions." If it were up to me, Gemini, I'd give you an Ig Nobel Prize for what you're about to do, which will fulfill one of the main criteria for winning: pulling off an entertaining feat that first makes people laugh, then makes them think.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Do you have a lucky number? Many people do. Some decide on theirs by choosing a number that figured prominently in one of their life's turning points. Others arrive at it by adding the digits of their birth date or by taking the numerological value of their name. So-called "master numbers" like 22, 33, and 55 are favorites, too. Personally, I have two special numbers: 23 zillion and 3.1415926, the value of pi. I hope this whets your imagination, Cancerian. Your fortunes are in the process of changing, and it would be a good time to pick a new lucky number. If I were you, I'd also seek out a new power animal, initiation name, and talismanic symbol.

Leo (July 23-August 22)

The most dangerous frame of mind for you to inhabit in the next six weeks -- the state of awareness that would be most harmful to your long-term interests -- would be utter certainty. You simply cannot afford to be a know-it-all expert who's fixated on a set of seemingly foolproof theories. On the other hand, Leo, if you're willing to question everything you think you know, robust health and emotional wealth will surely be yours. Here's a ritual to set the mood: Put angel food cake and devil's food cake on a plate, then take five bites of each while intoning the affirmation, "I am hungry for the kaleidoscopic, chameleon-like, unimaginable truth."

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

My Aquarian and Sagittarian friends are the best laughers I know. By that I mean that they laugh longer and more frequently than most. They also tend to chortle at ironies that others take way too seriously. Best of all, their laughs are works of art: sudden, explosive, wild, and uncanny. I mention this, Virgo, because I believe you're entering a phase when you'll have the potential to mutate into an Aquarian- or Sagittarian-style laugher. Please take full advantage of this hilarious opportunity. Explore the untapped depths of your sense of humor. Give your laughter the chance to grow dramatically in its power to heal both you and everyone who is sprayed with the saliva flung out during your paroxysms of primal amusement.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

Last year the Boston Globe ran 901 corrections of previously published information. In other words, it averaged 17.3 acknowledged mistakes per week. The Chicago Tribune's total was 658, or 12.7 errors per week. Even though your blooper rate will be higher than usual in the coming days, it won't come anywhere near theirs. There'll be no excuse for berating yourself or succumbing to massive outbreaks of guilt, then, will there? Even at your most flub-prone, you'll still be more perfect than two of America's most well-respected newspapers. I suggest, though, that to minimize flak from insensitive critics, you borrow the Globe's or Tribune's approach. You can get away with a lot if "I confess" or "I'm sorry" is always on the tip of your tongue.

Arunothai Sriaran is Thailand's new "Miss Drunk." She won the title in a contest after gulping down too much wine and navigating her way through an obstacle course while wearing a heavy silk dress and golden headgear. In the insouciant spirit of this wicked fun, and in accordance with your current astrological omens, I hereby name you "Ms. (or Mr.) Drunk-on-Life." Your carefree and mischievously benevolent reign will last for either three weeks or until you stop learning new tricks about the art of being intelligently wild, whichever comes last.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

You're progressing nicely in your efforts to master life's most complicated skills. For instance, you're making better and better mistakes all the time. You're getting pretty good at being three places at once, too; and with every passing month you know more about using your fears to motivate you so they won't paralyze you. What you'd benefit from most right now, though, is a refresher course in the simplest fundamentals. For starters, you still have a lot to learn about how to sleep and eat. And it's not too far-fetched to say that you could use some breathing lessons. For that matter, Sagittarius, you're not exactly a PhD in the art of happiness. I suggest you sniff around to see if there are any crafty elders offering workshops on how to regard everything that comes your way as a blessing.

Forget about the 900-pound gorilla problem, Capricorn; you've got it pretty much neutralized for now. I suggest you turn your attention to the three-gram hummingbird dilemma: you know, the beautiful little bundle of nonstop energy darting around like neon fire. Please keep in mind that the brave forcefulness you summoned to deal with the gorilla may not be of much help in this fresh challenge. A suggestion: Try tuning in to your own inner hummingbird.

"The elephant never gets tired of carrying its tusks," says a proverb of the Vai tribe in Liberia. I suggest you make that a central meditation in the coming week, Aquarius. Maybe it'll inspire you to intensify your commitment to the duties that make you so unique and beautiful. It's the perfect astrological moment to do that. Do not, however, interpret the proverb to mean you should keep hauling around toxic emotions that you generated while neurotically slaving away at obnoxious duties in the distant past. They not only weaken and uglify you, they're also unnecessary. Dump them.

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

The average Pisces catches 147 colds in a lifetime, endures a serious case of hurt feelings three times a month, and fantasizes about the end of the world once every 6.2 days. I predict, however, that you will experience none of the above during the coming weeks. That's because you're slipping into a grace period that may shock you with its ease, beauty, and abundance. It will be a time when your innocence regenerates and your wisdom freshens; a seed time when your determination to feel good will trump your habitual tendencies to expect the worst; a time of awakening when your perceptions will deepen and expand even as the world is created anew right in front of your eyes.

No one knows you better than you do, Pisces. But maybe you'll be inspired to dig up even more self-knowledge in the coming week if you tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6.

Aries (March 21-April 19) 

Before he died in late 2001, ex-Beatle George Harrison recorded the album "Brainwashed." Reviewers at People magazine found it exceptional. "Rollicking, jaunty and wry," they wrote, "Harrison looked death in the eye and took out his ukulele." I provide this image to inspire you in the coming week, Aries. While you won't have to deal with an adversary anywhere near as daunting as the Grim Reaper, you will have to face down a pest of some sort. The best recipe for victory is to assume an attitude that is rollicking, jaunty, and wry. When you look the skunk or jerk in the eye, pull out a kazoo.

Mojo means magic power or uncanny charisma. It can also refer to a fertility spell or sexual magnetism. Cat Yronwode, scholar of indigenous African-American religions, believes that while "mojo" may be a corruption of the word "magic," it's more likely derived from the West African word "mojuba," which refers to a prayer of praise and homage. In voodoo, a mojo bag is a cloth pouch filled with supernatural charms. "Mojo" is also invoked to mean the unpredictable benevolence of a mysterious force beyond our comprehension or the skill of a person who has stolen a boon from the gods. I hope these definitions will help you make the most of the fact that your relationship with mojo is now ripening nicely, Taurus.

Pollsters asked a thousand kids aged 3-6 which they liked better, daddy or TV. Fifty-three percent asserted that they preferred TV. But even if your own inner child might be inclined to vote with the majority on this question, Gemini, I beg you to go in the other direction in the coming weeks. Why? Because you could really use the inspiration of a father figure: a benevolent older male who can inspire you to activate your latent reserves of ferocious willpower and wild confidence.

Cancer (June 21-July 22)

Yesterday I was busy reorganizing my room. While moving some things to make room for my laptop on a shelf, I temporarily placed it on the floor. "Please take note, Rob," I said pointedly to myself as I resumed puttering, "that the computer is now on the floor. Do not step on the computer. Did you hear me? Do not step on the computer." A minute later I got distracted by a phone call and ambled off to another part of the house. When I returned, I was lost in thought. As you might guess, my right shoe soon landed directly on the laptop. The damage cost me $125 to repair. The moral of the story, as far as it concerns your imminent future, Cancerian: Don't put the laptop on the floor in the first place.

In the premise of the TV reality show, "Joe Millionaire," twenty women vied for the heart of a suave young rich dude, not knowing he was actually an average construction worker in disguise. The aspiring consorts were asked what they would do if chosen to help the guy spend his $50 million. One said, "I'd travel to a poor Third World country and bathe the suffering children." While that sentiment might be a little extreme for you to adopt, Leo, I urge you to envision your own version of altruistic generosity. How would you help others if you got a windfall? Believe it or not, carrying out this imaginative exercise will enhance your ability to attract more money into your life. And it's the perfect astrological moment to do just that.

Virgo (August 23-September 22)

Many of us indulge frequently in the fantasy that our lives would be wonderful if only they were different from what they are. Here's a corollary to the curse: No matter what the current state of our relationship to love may be, we always imagine that it should be better. If we don't have a romantic partner, we think we should have one. If we do have a romantic partner, we wish he or she would change, or we wonder what it would be like to be with another partner. That's the bad news, Virgo. Here's the good news: In the coming days, I predict you will find a way to feel perfectly at peace with the way your love life actually is.

Libra (September 23-October 22)

The coming weeks will test your ability to think with your heart and feel with your mind. You will have to be acutely vigilant even as you stay sweetly relaxed. Your luck will grow to the degree that you open your doors of perception wider and close down the vulnerabilities that make it easy for mean people to hurt you. Fortunately, Libra, the cosmos will be conspiring to help you achieve a growing expertise in these exact capacities. I predict that by March 20 you will have earned the right to be called a master of contradictions.

Life will bring you entertaining revelations in the coming week, Libra. To explore even deeper, dive into your 
Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Scorpio (October 23-November 21)

You know what you remind me of lately, Scorpio? You're like gourmet sea salt that has been hand-harvested on a warm, breezy afternoon in late summer from a pristine marsh in Brittany. You are, in other words, raw and elegant; you're primal and pure; you're a basic necessity but exquisitely unique. I trust that you will share your funky sublimity only with those who treat you as both a valuable spice and an essential condiment.

Sagittarius (November 22-December 21) 

Astronomers rely on telescopes to gather the observations that serve as their raw material. Not all their time is spent gazing up at the heavens, however. They have plenty of opportunities to work on "cloudy night problems," interpreting and massaging their data when the skies are overcast. I'd like to suggest that you're in an analogous phase, Sagittarius. At least for the moment, you can't glean any more crucial clues from peering outward into the glittering sprawl around you. Everything you need to know is contained within the observations you have already made and the information you've already registered.

Want more clues, Sagittarius? Need further insight? I discuss your coming week in greater depth in your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Capricorn (December 22-January 19)

How many times have you wondered what your life would be like if your imagination hadn't been squelched by the educational system? What great happiness and marvelous feats might you have already claimed if your natural love of learning hadn't been crushed by bad teachers and inept pedagogy? It's the right astrological time to launch a quest to undo the damage, Capricorn. Imagine I've just handed you an undiploma: your official release from the oppression of your formal education; the beginning of your healing from the wounds perpetrated on you by your early schooling.

Where do you want to go in the coming week, Capricorn? Who do you want to be? For more clues, tune in to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Aquarius (January 20- February 18)

If you were out walking and spied a penny on the sidewalk, would you stoop down to scoop it up? Probably not. How about a higher denomination coin? Or is it your policy to never compromise your dignity for anything less than a dollar? If so, Aquarius, I encourage you to suspend your usual rule in the next two weeks. Metaphorically speaking, bending down to snatch a penny will set in motion a series of events that will lead to you finding a hundred-dollar bill. In other words, it's only by taking advantage of tiny unexpected rewards that you'll put yourself in a position to harvest the bigger kind.

Need a few more whacks applied to your mental blocks in the coming week, Aquarius? A few more caresses administered to your growing edge? Cruise on over to your Expanded Audio Horoscope. The reading costs $6. 

Pisces (February 19-March 20)

"Three times my life has opened," begins Jane Hirshfield's poem by the same name. "Once, into darkness and rain. Once, into what the body carries at all times within it and starts to remember each time it enters the act of love. Once, to the fire that holds all." Now that you've had your imagination piqued by Hirshfield's testimony, Pisces, I'd like you to survey your memories and identify the magic moments when your own life opened. Jot down a few notes about them, please. That should prime you to recognize and be ready for the next big window of opportunity, which will arrive any day now.

Got enough clues to chew on for a while, Pisces? If you need more, give yourself the luxury of your Expanded Audio Horoscope for the coming week. The reading costs $6.
